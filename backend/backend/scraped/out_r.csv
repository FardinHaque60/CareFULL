0,What Is Tularemia?,"Tularemia is a rare infectious disease that can attack your skin , lungs , eyes , and lymph nodes . Sometimes it’s called rabbit fever or deer fly fever . It’s caused by a bacteria called Francisella tularensis . Causes People can become sick with tularemia, but it’s not a disease that naturally occurs in humans. It often affects rabbits and other animals including rodents, sheep, and birds. House pets like dogs and cats can get tularemia too. These are some of the ways people can get it: Insect bites , especially from a deer fly or tick Coming into contact with the skin, hair , or meat of an animal that’s infected Consuming contaminated water or food, such as undercooked meat Breathing in bacteria that comes up from the soil during an activity like construction or gardening It’s also possible to become infected if you’re exposed to the bacteria in a laboratory setting, or potentially, in an act of bioterrorism. Tularemia can happen anywhere in the world, but it’s most common in rural areas where animals are more likely to be infected with the bacteria. It can survive in soil, water , and dead animals for weeks. That’s why it can cause infections in so many different ways. The way you become infected with the disease influences the type of symptoms you’ll have and how severe they may be. But just because you’re exposed to the bacteria doesn’t mean you’ll become sick with the disease. Symptoms If you do become sick after being exposed to Francisella tularensis , you’re likely to start having symptoms within 3 to 5 days, but it can take up to 2 weeks. There are different types of tularemia that each have their own specific symptoms. Ulceroglandular tularemia is the most common variety of the disease. Symptoms can include: An ulcer on the skin that’s usually caused by a bite from an infected animal or insect Lymph glands that are painful and swollen Fever Chills Headache Fatigue Oculoglandular tularemia affects the eyes . Symptoms can include: Pain , swelling, or discharge in the eye Redness in the eye Light sensitivity An ulcer that forms inside the eyelid Tender lymph glands around the ear, neck, and jaw Oropharyngeal tularemia affects the mouth , throat, and digestive system . It’s the form of the disease that’s most often caused by eating undercooked meat from a wild animal or drinking water that’s contaminated. Symptoms can include: Throat pain Vomiting Diarrhea Swollen tonsils or lymph nodes in the neck Ulcers in the mouth Fever Pneumonic tularemia can cause symptoms that are often associated with pneumonia , including: Trouble breathing Pain in the chest A dry cough Typhoidal tularemia is a rare, but very serious form of the disease. Symptoms can include: An enlarged spleen or liver Diarrhea and vomiting Severe fatigue Elevated fever Who’s at Risk? Tularemia is rare. There are only about 200 cases reported each year in the United States. People get it most from tick bites or contact with a contaminated animal. The following can also increase your risk for developing tularemia: Jobs such as laboratory worker, farmer, veterinarian, hunter, landscaper, wildlife manager, and meat handler Living in or visiting the south-central United States Hunting or gardening. Wild animals may be infected with tularemia, and stirring up soil may cause bacteria to be released. Diagnosis and Treatment It can be hard to diagnose tularemia because the symptoms can be similar to other diseases. Your doctor will test you to confirm the bacteria is present. They may also order a chest X-ray to check for signs of pneumonia . Treatment usually involves antibiotics , either injected or by mouth . If you have complications like pneumonia or meningitis , you’ll also need treatment for these conditions. Usually people who have had tularemia become immune to it, but some people get it more than once. Prevention You can protect yourself by: Not using bare hands to skin or dress wild animals Avoiding sick or dead animals Wearing clothing that covers exposed skin (tight at the wrists and ankles ) Using insect repellents Removing ticks promptly Drinking clean water Fully cooking wild meats"
1,Rabies: Symptoms and Treatment,"What Is Rabies? Rabies is a virus that attacks the central nervous system . It's found only in mammals, which are warm-blooded animals with fur or hair (including humans) . Human cases of the virus are extremely rare in the United States, but if it's not treated before symptoms appear, it's deadly. Rabies has the highest mortality rate -- 99.9% -- of any disease on earth. The key is to get treated right away if you think you've been exposed to an animal that has rabies. The rabies virus causes the rabies infection and can spread through saliva, often from an infected animal biting another animal or human. In the U.S., rabies is mostly found in wild animals like coyotes, raccoons, skunks, bats, and foxes. Rabies is fully preventable if you get treated with vaccines as soon as possible after exposure.  (Photo credit: E+/Getty Images) Rabies Causes The rabies virus causes the rabies infection and can spread through saliva, often from an infected animal biting another animal or human. The virus is found only in mammals. In the United States, rabies is mostly found in wild animals like coyotes, raccoons, skunks, bats, and foxes. Pets (such as dogs and cats) and livestock (like horses and cattle) can also get rabies. Most pets and livestock that get rabies were not vaccinated against it. In the U.S., dog owners are required to vaccinate their pets against rabies, but in other countries without that law, it's common for dogs to get rabies. Rabies in Humans Normally, rabies is spread through a deep bite or scratch from an infected animal. Rabies is passed through direct contact with saliva, such as through a cut in the skin, or mucous membranes like the eyes, nose, or mouth. You could also get rabies from touching brain or nervous system tissue from an infected animal. Human cases of the virus are very rare in the United States, but if it's not treated before symptoms appear, it's deadly. Most humans in this country who were infected with rabies got it from bats. People may not recognize a scratch or bite from a bat, because it can be very small. Exposure to rabid dogs outside the U.S. is the second leading cause of rabies deaths in Americans and the top cause in other countries. Types of Rabies There are two forms of rabies: Furious rabies Furious rabies is known for causing hyperactivity (being extremely excitable  or having overactive movement) and hallucinations (seeing, hearing, or sensing something that isn't there). Other symptoms include hydrophobia (fear of water) and sometimes aerophobia (fear of fresh air, or drafts). After a few days, furious rabies leads to death from cardiorespiratory arrest (when heart activity and breathing stops). Paralytic rabies Paralytic rabies is known for causing paralysis (being unable to move) and coma (a deep state of unconsciousness). This form of rabies is found in 20% of human cases and is often misdiagnosed. Symptoms include muscle paralysis that starts at the location of the bite or scratch. People with paralytic rabies slowly become comatose and eventually die. Rabies Symptoms Typically, there are no symptoms right away. Rabies can lay dormant in your body for 1 to 3 months. Doctors call this the ""incubation period."" Symptoms will appear once the virus travels through your central nervous system and hits your brain . The first sign that something is wrong is fever. You might feel generally tired or weak or have a headache or flu-like symptoms. You may have a cough or sore throat, muscle pain, nausea and vomiting, or diarrhea. You may also feel pain, tingling, or burning at the site of the wound. These symptoms may last for days. As the virus spreads through your central nervous system, you'll develop other, more severe symptoms. They include: Inability to sleep ( insomnia ) Anxiety Confusion (which can affect your movement, thinking, emotions, and more) Brain dysfunction Slight or partial paralysis Hyperactivity Being easily agitated Hallucinations Seizures Salivating more than usual Difficulty swallowing Abnormal behavior Breathing fast (hyperventilation) Racing heart Muscle twitching Different sized pupils Neck stiffness (related to paralytic rabies) In time, these symptoms give way to coma , heart or lung failure, and death. Rabies hydrophobia Hydrophobia is a symptom of furious rabies. It is a fear of water that can happen in the late stage of a rabies infection. People with hydrophobia have muscle spasms when they see, hear, or taste water. Rabies Phases Rabies travels from an infected wound to your brain over a period of time. There are several phases most people go through when exposed to the rabies virus: incubation, prodromal phase, acute neurologic phase, and coma. Once rabies is past the incubation phase, it cannot be treated.  If you think you've been exposed to an animal that has rabies, it is very important to get treated right away, before the virus moves to the prodromal phase. Incubation. Incubation is the first phase after exposure to the rabies virus. The virus can spend days to weeks in your body before it moves to your nervous system. You won't have any symptoms during the incubation phase. Prodromal phase. This phase starts when the rabies virus (RABV) enters your nervous system. The virus moves through your nerve cells into your brain and spinal cord and damages your nerves along the way. During this phase, your immune system will try to fight the virus, which causes flu-like symptoms. Nerve damage may cause tingling, pain, or numbness where you were bitten or scratched. The prodromal phase lasts 2-10 days. Acute neurologic phase. This phase is when the rabies virus begins to damage your brain and spinal cord. People with furious rabies will have symptoms like aggression, seizures, and delirium. People with paralytic rabies will have weakness and paralysis that moves from the bite wound to the rest of their body. Furious rabies lasts from a few days to a week. Paralytic rabies can last up to a month. Coma. Coma is the final stage of a rabies infection for many people. Eventually, rabies leads to death. Rabies Treatment There are no approved treatments for rabies once you have symptoms. However, there are steps you can take to prevent rabies if you've been bitten or scratched by a wild animal or had contact with an infected animal. If you think you may have been exposed to rabies, contact a health care professional right away. If you were bitten or scratched, clean your wound with soap and water. Your provider can give you further instructions on cleaning the wound. If you find a bat in a room where someone was sleeping or children were present, assume there was contact as well. To prevent RABV from causing rabies, your provider will give you a series of vaccinations (shots). You'll also be given an antibody treatment near your wound if you've never been vaccinated before. These medications prevent an infection from traveling to your brain if you've been exposed to the rabies virus. This is a preventive treatment known as post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). You may also need a tetanus shot for your wound if you haven't had one in the past 10 years. If you are pregnant , rabies shots are safe for you and your baby. Rabies Vaccine Two kinds of PEP medication are used to prevent rabies after you've been exposed to the virus: Human rabies immune globulin (HRIG). You will be given a shot of human rabies immune globulin (HRIG) only if you've never had a rabies vaccine before. HRIG immediately gives your body antibodies until it is able to make its own in response to the rabies vaccine. An antibody is a type of protein your immune system makes to fight off harmful viruses, bacteria, and other intruders. Rabies vaccine. Your health care provider will also give you a shot of rabies vaccine to prevent a rabies infection after you've been exposed to the virus. The vaccine teaches your body to destroy the rabies virus before it reaches your brain. Current vaccines are given in your arm, not your stomach. You may have mild side effects from the rabies vaccine. These include: Pain, itching, or swelling where your shots were injected Nausea Headache Dizziness Muscle pain Let your doctor know if you have any serious side effects. Vaccine schedule It is important to get your rabies shots as soon as possible after your exposure to the virus. Your first shots will be given right away. A series of shots must be given on a schedule: HRIG is given right away. It's injected only once, and only to people who have never been vaccinated against rabies before. This is because once you've had a rabies vaccine, your body will know how to make antibodies to fight the infection. The rabies vaccine is given in four doses. You'll get the first shot as soon as possible after exposure. This is also known as day 0. You'll receive your three remaining shots on days 3, 7, and 14 after the first vaccination. If you've been vaccinated against rabies before this exposure, you will only get shots this time on days 0 and 3. Can You Tell If an Animal Has Rabies? You might have an image in your head of a dog or raccoon acting aggressively and foaming at the mouth . But it's not so easy to tell if you're looking at a rabid animal. Most wild animals that have rabies actually act shy or timid. That's not the way wild animals normally act, so steer clear. Here are some common-sense rules for dealing with stray or wild animals: Never pet a stray dog or cat. If you see an animal acting strangely (it's aggressive or tries to bite you), call your local animal control. Never touch a wild animal--even if it looks dead. Rabies Risk Factors In the U.S., there is a low risk of dogs getting rabies because of laws requiring vaccines in pets. This reduces the risk of you getting bitten by a dog with rabies. Around the world, humans are at a higher risk of getting rabies from dogs. Children are often at the highest risk of getting bitten by a rabid dog. They are also more likely to have severe exposure to the rabies virus by getting bitten many times. Multiple bites make it harder to prevent a rabies infection. Most people in the U.S. have a low risk of being exposed to the rabies virus. However, some people are at a higher risk. This includes people who work with the rabies virus (such as laboratory workers), those who handle animals that could have rabies (such as veterinarians), people who visit caves or other areas with lots of bats, and those who travel to parts of the world where rabies is common and it's harder to get medical care. If you are in a high-risk group, there are ways to protect yourself before exposure. Rabies Prevention If you are bitten, scratched, or possibly had contact with an animal with rabies, seek medical care right away. Rabies is 100% preventable if you get vaccine doses (post-exposure prophylaxis/PEP) before the virus moves to your brain. Once you show symptoms of the rabies, the disease will become deadly. Here are additional steps you can take to protect yourself and your pets from rabies: Take your dog, cat, or other pet (only mammals can get rabies) to the veterinarian for regular checkups and make sure your pet is up to date with rabies vaccinations. Don't let your pets wander outdoors, or watch them when outside. Spay or neuter your pets to prevent strays that may not be properly cared for. Call animal control to report any stray animals in your neighborhood, since they may be unvaccinated or sick. Wash animal bites or scratches immediately with soap and water. Avoid contact with wildlife, including injured animals; instead, call animal control or other local authorities for help. Before you travel outside the United States, find out if rabies is present in dogs or wildlife at your destination. If you are traveling to an area with a high risk of rabies, or you work with or near animals known to carry rabies, talk to your doctor about getting pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a series of rabies vaccine doses given before exposure to the virus. Remember to seek medical attention after possible exposure to the rabies virus, even if you've had PrEP doses of the vaccine. Two additional doses will be needed to prevent the virus from infecting your brain. Rabies Prognosis You can survive being exposed to rabies if you're treated as soon as possible, before you have symptoms. Treatment in the U. S. includes one dose of human rabies immune globulin (HRIG) and four doses of rabies vaccine over a 14-day period. You should get HRIG and your first dose of rabies vaccine as soon as possible after exposure. Current vaccines are given in your arm, not your stomach. You may have some pain at the injection site or feel mildly ill after the vaccine. You can live for several weeks or months without symptoms after being exposed to rabies. Once the virus has moved to your central nervous system (brain and spinal cord), rabies causes death within a few days. That's why early medical care is so important. Once you are showing symptoms that the virus is affecting your brain, there are no effective treatments available. Can rabies be cured? There is no cure for rabies. However, rabies is 100% preventable if you're vaccinated quickly after exposure to the rabies virus. Once you have symptoms, the disease is fatal. Takeaways Rabies is a virus that attacks your brain and spinal cord. You get it from being bitten, scratched, or exposed to the saliva of an animal with rabies. Rabies is fully preventable if you get treated with vaccines as soon as possible after exposure. Once the virus has moved to your brain, causing symptoms, the disease will lead to death within days. Rabies FAQs Why do people or animals with rabies fear water? Furious rabies is one of the two kinds of rabies. A symptom of furious rabies is a fear of water known as hydrophobia (hydro means water, phobia means fear). People or animals with hydrophobia have muscle spasms when they see, hear, or drink water. What is the survival rate of a rabies patient? Rabies is 100% survivable if it's treated properly before the virus has reached the brain. Treatment in the U.S. includes one dose of human rabies immune globulin (HRIG) and four doses of rabies vaccine over a 14-day period. It's important to get your first dose of HRIG and rabies vaccine as soon as possible after exposure to the rabies virus. If you don't get the vaccines, the virus will move through your central nervous system to your brain. Once you have symptoms of rabies, the disease is nearly always fatal. Fewer than 20 people have ever survived after reaching that phase of rabies. What is the lifespan of the rabies virus? Outside the host body, the rabies virus becomes noninfectious when it dries out and is exposed to sunlight. The timing of this will vary depending on the environment. Generally, if the surface containing the virus is dry, the virus is likely noninfectious. To be safe, never handle a dead wild animal with your bare hands. How long before rabies kills a dog? Once a dog has been exposed to rabies, the virus will travel through the nerves to the spinal cord and brain. This can take anywhere from 3-12 weeks and the dog will not show signs of being sick during this phase. Once the virus reaches the brain, the dog will begin showing symptoms of illness and will usually die within 7 days."
2,What Is Rabson-Mendenhall Syndrome?,"One of the most basic things your body does is get energy from your food and deliver it to your cells. It’s a lot like gassing up your car, but in this case, sugar provides the energy. Usually, a hormone called insulin controls the process. It tells the sugar when to move out of your blood and into your cells. If you have Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome, this process breaks down. Your body can’t use insulin like it needs to. It’s a very rare condition. When insulin can’t do its job, it impacts how your body grows. And the effects start even before birth. Babies who have it tend to be smaller than usual and struggle to grow and gain weight . Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome is part a group of conditions that doctors call severe insulin resistance syndromes. These include Donohue syndrome and type A insulin resistance syndrome. Causes Rabson-Mendenhal is a condition you get from your parents, and it happens because of a glitch in a gene called the INSR gene. Each of your cells has two copies of every gene. One copy comes from your mother and one from your father. When you have Rabson-Mendenhall, it means you have the glitch in both copies of the INSR gene. If only one copy has it, you won’t have the condition. So when a child gets Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome, it’s because each parent had one copy that was normal and one that had the glitch. Then, they both happened to pass the copy with the glitch onto the child, and 3 out of 4 times that doesn’t happen. Symptoms Signs and symptoms may start to show in the first year of life and are more severe in some people than in others. It can cause problems with your: Head and face. These can include rough skin , wide space between the eyes , deep grooves in the tongue , and larger-than-normal ears, lips, and jaw. Nails . They may be thicker than usual. Skin . Dryness is one problem. Another might be acanthosis nigricans (skin that darkens and thickens). It may feel like velvet, especially in areas where it folds, like the underarms and neck. Teeth . They can be larger than normal, crowded, or come in too early. Other common signs and symptoms include: Larger organs than normal, including the kidney , heart , penis , and clitoris Much more hair than is typical Slow growth before and after birth Swelling in the belly Very little fat under the skin Weak muscles And it can lead to conditions such as: Cysts on the ovaries Diabetes , which can cause a life-threatening condition called ketoacidosis Kidney problems Diagnosis One of the challenges in telling whether someone has Rabson-Mendenhall is making sure it’s not a similar condition, such as Donohue syndrome. Your child’s doctor will do a physical exam and ask about their symptoms and health history. They’ll probably want to get blood tests to check on your child’s blood sugar and insulin levels. Treatment Treating Rabson-Mendenhall usually requires a team of doctors, surgeons, dentists, and others. Your family may also want to seek counseling to work through the emotions of having a rare disease. Since there’s no cure, treatment often focuses on specific symptoms, such as surgery to remove cysts or fix dental problems. Sometimes, doctors use high doses of insulin or certain drugs that help the body use insulin, but often these don’t work for very long. Experts are looking for better treatment options for hyperglycemia (high blood sugar ) linked to severe insulin resistance. These treatments have shown some good results so far, though more research is needed: Biguanides. These are medicines that cause your body to make less glucose (sugar) and boost its use of insulin. Leptin . This protein may help with blood sugar and blood insulin levels. Recombinant insulin-like growth factor I (rhIGF-I). This protein treats ketoacidosis that is caused by severe insulin resistance. Ketoacidosis is the buildup of ketones – a substance that forms when the body breaks down fat for energy instead of sugar."
3,What Is Nursemaid's Elbow?,"Many children squeal with delight when you swing them around or back and forth by the arms. But did you know that this fun activity can lead to one of the most common injuries in young kids? It is called nursemaid's elbow , and it can be quite painful for your little one. Nursemaid's elbow means the elbow has slipped out of its normal place at the joint. The elbow bone (radius) is connected to the elbow joint (humerus) by elastic bands called ligaments. These ligaments grow stronger and tighter as a child grows older. In little kids and babies, the ligaments are still loose. This makes it easy for the elbow to slip out of place. Your doctor or nurse may use other terms for nursemaid's elbow, like: Pulled elbow Radial head subluxation Who Gets Nursemaid's Elbow? Nursemaid's elbow is a common injury among toddlers and preschoolers . The injury is not often seen in kids older than 5 or 6. That's because as children grow, their bones harden and the ligaments get tighter and thicker. This helps keep the elbow firmly in place. Girls are slightly more likely than boys to get nursemaid's elbow. What Causes Nursemaid's Elbow? Nursemaid's elbow can happen if you tug or pull on a child's lower arm or hand, especially if the arm is twisted. It doesn't take much force for the injury to happen. The most common cause of nursemaid's elbow is a pulling-type injury. Nursemaid's elbow may happen if you: Catch a child by the hand to stop a fall Lift a child up by the hands or wrists Pull a child's arm through a jacket sleeve Swing a child by the arms or hands Yank on a child's arm to make them walk faster Sometimes nursemaid's elbow may happen if: An infant rolls over onto the arm A child uses the hands to brace themselves during a fall What Are the Symptoms of Nursemaid's Elbow? The main symptom of a pulled elbow is pain when the child moves the arm. In fact, nursemaid's elbow can be quite painful. There is, though, no swelling, bruising, or other sign of a serious injury. The child may: Complain that the elbow hurts Cry when the arm is moved or touched Hold the arm close to their side or support it with the other arm Not use the arm You should not try to straighten the arm or move the elbow back into place. If you do, the child will resist, and you could cause more serious damage. Severe pain, even without swelling, can be the sign of a broken bone. Call your doctor if your child injures their elbow. How Is Nursemaid's Elbow Treated? Treatment depends on your child's age and overall health. The doctor will examine the child and make sure the bone is not broken. X-rays are not usually necessary to diagnose this. Over-the-counter pain medicine, such as acetaminophen ( Tylenol ) or ibuprofen ( Advil , Motrin ), may be given. Make sure you ask your health care provider for the correct dose for your child. Never give aspirin to a child under age 12. The doctor will use a method called a ""reduction maneuver"" to put the elbow back into the correct position. This method is also called a ""reduction."" In this method, the doctor holds the child's wrist and elbow. The doctor then carefully moves the arm in a specific way until the elbow pops back into place. You may hear a ""click"" when this happens. A reduction maneuver only takes a few seconds. It may be done in the doctor's office. The procedure can be briefly painful. The child will probably cry for a few seconds. Most kids can use the arm without pain within 10 to 15 minutes. But some kids may be afraid to use the arm because they remember that it hurt before. If this happens, your doctor may recommend pain medicine and then observation for the next hour to make sure the child moves the arm. X-rays are usually not needed. X-ray results are normal in someone with nursemaid's elbow. But X-rays may be taken if the child does not move the arm after a reduction. Sometimes, the first attempt at reduction does not work. It may take two or more times to put the elbow back into the correct position. Surgery is rarely needed. If your doctor can’t put the elbow bone back into place, they’ll recommend emergency care. Nursemaid's elbow may sometimes be the result of child abuse. A child abuse investigation may be done if there are other signs that the child is being abused or if it occurs in an older child. Can You Prevent Nursemaid's Elbow? As your child grows, their ligaments will get stronger. So it will become less likely that pulling a child's arms will cause nursemaid's elbow. Until then, you may be able to prevent nursemaid's elbow if you follow these tips: Do not lift a child up by the arms or hands. Lift the child under the arms instead. Do not tug or jerk a child's hand or arm. Never swing a child by the hands or arms. Kids who have had nursemaid's elbow are more likely to get it again in the future."
4,What Is Radiation Sickness?,"Radiation sickness happens when a large dose of high-energy radiation goes through your body and reaches your internal organs. It takes far more than what you might get from any medical treatment to cause it. Doctors named the illness, which is technically known as acute radiation syndrome, after the atomic bombings that ended World War II. It's not clear how many of the 150,000 to 250,000 people killed in those attacks died from radiation sickness. But estimates at the time put the number in the hundreds or thousands. Since then, about 50 people have died from radiation sickness. That includes 28 workers and firefighters who were killed at the 1986 nuclear accident at Chernobyl in what is now Ukraine. More than 100 others at Chernobyl were diagnosed with acute radiation syndrome but survived. Most of the other people who have died from it were scientists or technicians in U.S. or Soviet nuclear plants during the Cold War. But in 1999, three workers got radiation sickness after an accident involving nuclear fuel in Japan; two of them died. No cases of radiation sickness were reported after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident in 2011. Radiation Basics The amount of radiation your body gets is measured in an international unit called a sievert (Sv). Symptoms of radiation sickness show up when you're exposed to levels of more than 500 millisieverts (mSv), or half a sievert. More than 4 to 5 Sv is likely to be fatal. The workers who got radiation sickness at Chernobyl received doses that measured 700 mSv to 13 Sv. Natural radiation is everywhere -- in the air, the water, and materials like brick or granite. You typically get only about 3 mSv -- three one-thousandths of a sievert -- of radiation from these natural sources in a year. Man-made sources of radiation from things like X-rays add about another 3 mSv. A CT (computerized tomography) scan, which involves several X-rays taken from different angles, delivers about 10 mSv. People who work in the nuclear industry aren't allowed to be exposed to more than 50 mSv a year. Symptoms of Radiation Sickness The most common early symptoms of radiation sickness are the same as for many other illnesses -- nausea , vomiting , and diarrhea . They can start within minutes of exposure, but they may come and go for several days. If you have these symptoms after a radiation emergency, you should seek medical help as soon as it's safe to do so. You might also have skin damage, like a bad sunburn , or get blisters or sores. Radiation may also damage the cells that make hair , causing your hair to fall out. In some cases, hair loss might be permanent. The symptoms can go away entirely for anywhere from a few hours to weeks. But if they come back, they're often worse. Treatment Radiation damages your stomach and intestines , blood vessels, and bone marrow, which makes blood cells . Damage to bone marrow lowers the number of disease-fighting white blood cells in your body. As a result, most people who die from radiation sickness are killed by infections or internal bleeding . Your doctor will try to help you fight off infections. They might give you blood transfusions to replace lost blood cells. Or they may give you medications to try to help your bone marrow recover. Or they may try a transplant. They also will give you fluids and treat other injuries like burns . Recovery from radiation sickness can take up to 2 years. But you'll still be at risk of other health problems after recovery. For example, your odds of getting cancer are higher."
5,What to Expect From Radiation Therapy,"Radiation therapy treats cancer by using high-energy waves to kill tumor cells. The goal is to destroy or damage the cancer without hurting too many healthy cells. It is given over a certain time period; it can be given around the time of surgery or chemotherapy. It can also be used to ease pain caused by the tumor. This treatment can cause side effects, but they're different for everyone. The ones you have depend on the type of radiation you get, how much you get, the part of your body that gets treatment, and how healthy you are overall. There's no way to predict how radiation will affect you. You may have few or only mild side effects from your treatment; someone else may have a lot of problems or very severe ones. When you get radiation therapy, you'll work with a doctor who specializes in this type of medicine. It's important to talk with them about how the treatment might make you feel and what you can do to feel better. If the therapy makes you uncomfortable, speak up. If you keep your health team informed, they can help you get through treatment. How Soon Might I Have Side Effects From Radiation Therapy? There are two kinds of radiation side effects: early and late. Early side effects, such as nausea and fatigue , usually don’t last long. They may start during or right after treatment and last for several weeks after it ends, but then they get better. Late side effects, such as lung or heart problems, may take years to show up and are often permanent when they do. The most common early side effects are fatigue and skin problems. You might get others, such as hair loss and nausea, depending on where you get radiation. How Can I Handle Fatigue? The fatigue you feel from cancer and radiation therapy is different from other times you may have felt tired. It’s a distressing, persistent exhaustion that doesn’t get better with rest and can keep you from doing the things you normally do, like going to work or spending time with family and friends. The fatigue is out of proportion to your activity level. It also can seem different from day to day, which makes it hard to plan around it. It can even change how well you're able to follow your cancer treatment plan. Let your doctor know if you’re struggling with fatigue. They might be able to help. There are also things you can do to feel better: Take care of your health. Be sure you're taking your medications the way you're supposed to. Get plenty of rest, be as active as you can, and eat the right foods. Work with a counselor or take a class at your cancer treatment center to learn ways to conserve energy, reduce stress, and keep yourself from focusing on the fatigue. Save your energy for the activities that are most important to you. Tackle them first when you’re feeling up to it. Keep a balance between rest and activities. Too much bed rest can make you more tired. But don't over-schedule your days without giving yourself breaks. Ask for help from family and friends. If fatigue is interfering with your job, talk with your boss or HR department and ask about taking some time off from work or making adjustments in your schedule. Keep in mind that the fatigue from radiation therapy will probably go away within a few weeks after your treatment ends. What Kind of Skin Problems Can Radiation Therapy Cause? The way external radiation therapy affects your skin is similar to what happens when you spend time in the sun. It may look red, sunburned, or tanned. It may also get swollen or blistered. Your skin may also become dry, flaky, or itchy. Or it may start to peel. Be gentle with your skin: Don't wear tight clothing over the area that's being treated. Don't scrub or rub your skin. To clean it, use a mild soap and let lukewarm water run over it. Avoid putting anything hot or cold on the area unless the doctor tells you to. Ask your doctor before you use any type of ointment, oil, lotion, or powder on your skin. Ask about using corn starch to help relieve itching. Stay out of the sun as much as possible. Cover the area getting radiation with clothing or hats to protect it. Ask the doctor about using sunscreen if you must be outdoors. If you’re having radiation therapy for breast cancer , try not to wear a bra. If that isn't possible, wear a soft, cotton one without underwire. Don't use any tape, gauze, or bandages on your skin unless the doctor tells you to. Your skin should start to feel better a few weeks after therapy ends. But when it heals, it may be a darker color. And you’ll still need to protect yourself from the sun after radiation therapy has ended. Will Radiation Therapy Cause My Hair to Fall Out? Only people who get radiation to the scalp or the brain may have hair loss. Others won't. If it does happen, it’s usually sudden and comes out in clumps. In most cases, your hair will grow back after therapy stops, but it may be thinner or have a different texture. Some people choose to cut their hair short before treatment begins to make less weight on the hair shaft. If you lose hair on top of your head, be sure to wear a hat or a scarf to protect your scalp from the sun when you go outside. If you decide to buy a wig, ask the doctor to write a prescription for one and check to see if it's covered by your insurance or is a tax-deductible expense. What Are Other Possible Early Side Effects From Radiation Therapy? Other early side effects you might have usually depend on where you get the radiation. Eating Problems Radiation therapy to the head, neck, or parts of the digestive system can make you lose your appetite. But it's important to keep eating a healthy diet while you’re having treatment to keep your body strong. Try eating five or six small meals spread out through the day instead of three large ones. Try new recipes or foods. Keep healthy snacks on hand. It will help you eat when you're hungry rather than waiting for mealtimes and maybe losing your appetite. Mouth Problems Before you start radiation to your head or neck, see your dentist for a thorough exam. Radiation can cause problems in your mouth that include: Mouth sores (little cuts or ulcers) Lack of saliva Thick saliva Trouble swallowing Jaw stiffness Tell your cancer team about any of these problems so they can help you feel better. To help manage these side effects: Avoid spicy and acidic foods. Don't smoke, chew tobacco, or drink alcohol. Brush your teeth often with fluoride toothpaste and a soft brush. Hearing Problems Radiation therapy to the head can sometimes cause hearing problems. One reason might be that it hardens the wax in your ears. Let your doctor know if you have trouble hearing. Nausea Radiation to the head, neck, and any part of the digestive tract can cause nausea and vomiting. Let your doctor know if that happens. They can give you medicine to control it. Also, you might be able to learn relaxation techniques and biofeedback to help control and reduce feelings of nausea. Diarrhea Radiation therapy to your belly can cause diarrhea, which typically starts a few weeks after therapy begins. The doctor will likely prescribe medications to help control it. They’ll also suggest changes in your diet, such as eating small meals more often, avoiding high-fiber foods, and getting enough potassium. Fertility and Sexual Issues Radiation therapy to your pelvis can affect your sex drive and whether you’ll be able to have a child. If you want to start a family or have more children, it’s important to talk to your doctor about how the treatment will affect your fertility before treatment begins. Women shouldn’t try to get pregnant during radiation therapy because it can hurt the baby. It also can stop periods and cause other symptoms of menopause. For men, radiation to the testes can affect sperm count and how well they work. This doesn't necessarily mean you can't father a child. But if you want to have kids later on, you should talk with your doctor to see if you should use a sperm bank before treatment begins. Treatment to the pelvis can make sex painful for some women and can also cause scarring that makes the vagina less able to stretch. In men, radiation can affect the nerves and blood vessels that control erections. Your doctor can help you understand what might happen and how you can handle it. It's natural to have less interest in sex when you’re having treatment for cancer. But your sex drive will usually come back after treatment stops. Talk openly with your partner about how you can stay close. Make sure you listen to their concerns, too. What Are the Late Side Effects From Radiation Therapy? Late side effects from radiation therapy take months and sometimes years to show up and usually don’t go away. But not everyone will have them. These problems happen when radiation damages your body. For example, scar tissue can affect the way your lungs or your heart works. Bladder, bowel, fertility, and sexual problems can start after radiation to your belly or pelvis. Another possible late effect is a second cancer. Doctors have known for a long time that radiation can cause cancer. And research has shown that radiation treatment for one cancer can raise the risk for developing a different cancer later. Factors that can affect that risk include the amount of radiation used and the area that was treated. Talk with your doctor about the potential risk and how it compares to the benefits you’ll get from radiation therapy."
6,Radon: How It Can Affect Your Health,"What Is Radon? Radon is a radioactive gas you can't see, feel, taste, or smell. It starts out as uranium, a heavy metal found in the ground and most rocks on the planet. When uranium decays, it turns into another metal called radium. When radium breaks down, it becomes radon. Radon gas leaves the soil and becomes part of the air and water . It can be in the air around you, but it’s usually in very small amounts that aren't harmful. Large amounts of radon cause health problems. Even though it's a natural gas that comes from the earth, it can be toxic if you breathe in a lot of it over a long time. But there are some reliable ways you can keep your exposure low. How Does Radon Affect Your Health? When you breathe in radon, it gets into the lining of your lungs and gives off radiation. Over a long time, that can damage the cells there and lead to lung cancer . Radon is the second biggest cause of lung cancer after cigarette smoking . If you breathe a lot of radon and smoke, your chance of getting lung cancer is very high. About 21,000 people die each year from lung cancer related to radon. Some research has linked radon to other kinds of cancer , like childhood leukemia , but the evidence for that isn’t as clear. What Are the Symptoms of Radon Exposure? You won’t have symptoms of radon poisoning right away. Instead, health problems from the exposure, such as lung cancer , show up after many years. Lung cancer may start as a nagging cough , shortness of breath, or wheezing that doesn't go away. Other symptoms include coughing up blood , having chest pain , or losing weight without trying. If you notice any of these symptoms, call your doctor. There are no routine medical tests that can tell you if you’ve breathed in too much radon. And no treatments will clear it from your body. But if you think you may have been exposed, talk to your doctor about whether you should have tests to check for signs of lung cancer . How Are You Exposed to Radon? Buildings, like your home, school, or office, are built into the ground. If there are cracks in floors or walls, or small openings for pipes or wires that aren't fully sealed, radon can escape the soil and get indoors. Though it can get trapped in any enclosed area, radon levels are often highest in basements and crawl spaces because they're closest to the ground. Experts say that nearly 1 out of 15 houses in the U.S. has elevated levels of radon. Some building materials, like concrete and wallboard, are made from natural substances that give off radon. So are granite countertops. But the amount these sources give off is mostly low. They might raise the radon level in your home, though not likely to dangerous levels. Your job may put you in contact with radon, especially if you work underground or with phosphate fertilizers. Radon is also in water that comes from lakes, rivers, and reservoirs, but most of it is released into the air before the water gets to you. If your home's water supply comes from a well or another groundwater source, it may have more radon than water from a treatment facility. How Can I Protect Myself? You can test your home or office with a radon kit. Some will measure levels for a few days, and others can gather the data for at least 3 months. You leave a small measuring device in a room, and then send it to a lab. You can also hire a professional to test your home or workplace for you. The Environmental Protection Agency website has a list of approved contractors in each state. Radon is measured in picocuries. Anything higher than 4 picocuries, or 4 pCi/L, requires action. If you get these results, run another short- or long-term test to be sure. If the levels are still high, contact a certified professional about making repairs to your home or office. This may include sealing cracks or installing a ventilation system so radon doesn’t get trapped indoors."
7,What Is Rapp-Hodgkin Syndrome? Is It the Same as AEC?,"Rapp-Hodgkin syndrome is a rare disease that can affect your hair , nails, skin , sweat glands, and teeth . It’s caused by a problem with your genes, and it’s part of a larger group of conditions that doctors call “ectodermal dysplasia.” Rapp-Hodgkin syndrome has signs and symptoms that overlap extensively with those of ankyloblepharon-ectodermal defects-cleft lip/palate (AEC) syndrome, also called Hay-Wells syndrome. These two syndromes were classified as separate disorders until it was discovered that they both result from mutations in the same part of the same gene, TP63. Most researchers now consider Rapp-Hodgkin syndrome and AEC syndrome separate disorders that are part of the same disease spectrum. If you have it, it’s a lifelong condition. Although you can’t prevent or cure it, doctors can treat it. Causes Each of your cells has two copies of every gene. One comes from your mother and one from your father. AEC is caused by a glitch in one of your genes, the TP63 gene. If either copy of your TP63 gene has the glitch, you’ll have AEC. Sometimes, you get AEC from your parents. But more often, it’s something you’re randomly born with. A parent with the glitch has a 50% chance of passing on the gene to a child. Symptoms These can differ quite a bit from person to person. It even varies for people in the same family who have AEC. Common symptoms include: Cleft lip . This is when the upper lip doesn’t fully form and has an opening in it. Cleft palate. With this, there’s an opening in the roof of the mouth . Fewer sweat glands or none at all . People with this symptom can’t sweat as much and may easily feel overheated. Fused eyelids. This means they are joined partly or totally together. There may also be problems with the tear ducts, which can lead to dry eyes and pinkeye . Growth problems. Weight gain issues, too. Hearing loss . This can lead to delays in learning to talk . Missing or unusually shaped nails . Skin erosion . This is loss of skin in some areas. It can be life-threatening in infants. Teeth problems. These can include missing teeth, wide gaps between teeth, cone-shaped teeth, and thin enamel (the hard outer covering of the teeth). Urethra problem in men . The opening of the tube that carries pee outside the body may be on the underside of the penis . Very little hair -- on both head and face -- and dry or brittle hair. Diagnosis Usually, your doctor can tell you have AEC based on your symptoms, health history, and a physical exam . You may also get a genetic test to check on the TP63 gene, but not all labs can do this test. Parents with a risk of having a baby with AEC may be able to have their baby tested before birth. Treatment Doctors can treat many of the symptoms of AEC. You’ll work with a team that may include surgeons, skin doctors, dentists, eye doctors, and others. You and your family may also want to seek counseling to work through the emotional challenges of having a rare disease. Treatments for AEC symptoms may include: Dental implants for older kids and adults . These are anchors that go into the jaw bone to hold replacement teeth. Younger kids may get dentures, which are replacement teeth that you can easily take out. Ear tubes . This is done if fluid buildup causes hearing loss and ear infections . Eye drops for dry eyes . Gentle wound care for skin erosions. You may also need to clean erosions with a weak bleach solution, such as Dakins solution, to kill germs. Speech therapy. Surgery for cleft lip and cleft palate. Surgery to separate fused eyelids . If the eyelids are joined only in a few small sections, they may come apart on their own without surgery. Wigs to hide hair loss ."
8,Rashes,"What Are Rashes? Rashes are unusual changes in skin color or texture. They normally come from skin inflammation , which can have different causes. There are many types of rashes, including those caused by skin conditions like eczema, granuloma annulare , lichen planus , and pityriasis rosea . Eczema is a general term that describes several different conditions in which skin is inflamed, red, scaly, and itchy. Atopic dermatitis, which can cause an itchy rash, is one of the most common forms of eczema. (Photo credit: Moment/Getty Images) Symptoms of Rashes The symptoms that come along with a skin rash depend on the cause and type of rash. Some common symptoms include: Blistering Redness Scaly or dry skin Similarity to hives Blotchiness Swelling or inflammation Itchy skin Pain Infection of the areas of broken skin Shiny, flat-topped bumps Large affected areas of skin Circular-shaped affected areas Causes of Rashes Irritants and allergens in the climate/environment can cause rashes on the skin. Other common causes include: Viral or bacterial infections Skin conditions such as rosacea or eczema Stress Skin irritants (including soaps, skin care products , or some fabrics) Personal and/or family history of allergies, hay fever, or asthma Allergic to certain medications, including those that treat high blood pressure, heart disease, and arthritis Triggering agents from other conditions, such as hepatitis B or hepatitis C Some causes and triggers for rashes are unknown. Common Skin Rash Types Some common skin rash types include those caused by skin conditions like eczema, granuloma annulare, lichen planus, and pityriasis rosea. Eczema Eczema is a general term that describes several different conditions in which skin is inflamed, red, scaly, and itchy. Eczema is a common skin condition, and atopic dermatitis (also called atopic eczema) is one of the most common forms of eczema . It can affect adults or children and isn’t contagious. The way eczema looks can vary from person to person. In adults, eczema most often affects the hands, elbows, and back of your knees. In young children, eczema often also shows up on the face, back of the neck, and scalp. Some things can trigger a flare-up of eczema or make eczema worse, but they don’t cause the condition. Hives Hives is a skin condition that causes raised, itchy bumps or welts. If you have hives, you could be allergic to something airborne or an insect bite. It can also be caused by changes in the temperature and bacterial infections. Contact dermatitis The type of rash that comes from contact dermatitis happens when your body reacts to irritants such as detergents, fragrances, and chemicals. It can cause inflammation, itchiness, and redness. Granuloma annulare Granuloma annulare is a chronic skin condition. A circular-shaped rash with reddish bumps (papules) is a common symptom. Most often, it affects children and young adults. It's slightly more common in girls and is usually seen in people who are otherwise healthy. If you have granuloma annulare, you'll usually notice one or more rings of small, firm bumps over the back of your forearms, hands, or feet . The rash may be mildly itchy. Lichen planus Lichen planus is a common skin condition that causes shiny, flat-topped bumps. They often have an angular shape and a reddish-purplish color. Li chen planus can show up anywhere on the skin but often affects the insides of your wrists and ankles , lower legs, back, and neck. Some people have lichen planus inside their mouth , genital region, scalp, and nails. Thick collections of bumps may occur, especially on the shins. Lichen planus most often affects adults ages 30-70 years. It isn’t common in very young or elderly people. Pityriasis rosea Pityriasis rosea is a common skin rash that is usually mild. The condition often begins with a large, scaly, pink patch of skin on your chest or back. Next, you’ll notice one patch of pink skin quickly followed by more. Your skin will be itchy and red or inflamed. The number and sizes of spots can vary. Pityriasis rosea affects the back, neck, chest, abdomen , upper arms, and legs. The rash can differ from person to person. Viral conditions. Rashes on the skin can be the result of a viral infection such as measles or chickenpox. Psoriasis. This skin condition causes a rash is thick and scaly and usually appears on the knees, back, elbows, genitals, and scalp. It is permanent and can be passed down from your parents. Diagnosing Rashes Diagnosing a skin rash can be hard because the symptoms can be caused by many things. Your doctor will check your skin and ask about your symptoms and may decide to diagnose your rash using tests such as: Skin biopsy. This involves taking a small bit of skin from the affected area and sending it to a lab for testing for a virus or bacteria. (see symptoms and diagnosis of eczema ) Blood test. Your doctor can diagnose certain diseases by looking at antibodies in your blood. Also, rashes can be the result of systemic conditions, and blood tests can help to check how your organs may be affected. Allergy test. These tests include skin pricks or patch tests to look for allergens. During the test, your skin is exposed to certain allergens to detect any potential reactions. Treatment for Rashes The treatment your doctor recommends will depend on the cause of your skin rash. Some treatment options include: Over-the-counter and prescription creams and ointments. You can treat rashes caused by skin conditions like eczema with moisturizers that are fragrance-free and contain ingredients such as ceramides, glycerin , and mineral oil . Medications include over-the-counter creams and ointments containing the steroid hydrocortisone (for example, Cortizone -10, Cort-Aid, Dermarest Eczema, Neosporin Eczema). These products may help control the itching, swelling, and redness linked to eczema. In more severe cases, prescription-strength cortisone creams are also used. Steroids. If you have ongoing symptoms, your doctor may prescribe topical or oral steroid treatment, which can help with itchy and inflamed skin. Topical immunomodulators. For people with mild-to-moderate eczema, topical immunomodulators can help. These medications, including brand name products Elidel and Protopic , work by changing the body's immune response to allergens, thereby preventing flare-ups. Shots (injections). Injections can be used to treat rashes that come from certain skin conditions. Dupilumab ( Dupixent ), for example, is an injectable monoclonal antibody used in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. It clears the itch quickly in most patients. Cortisone shots can also be used in more severe cases. Phototherapy (light therapy). This is another treatment that helps some people with eczema. Phototherapy uses ultraviolet light, either ultraviolet A (UVA) or ultraviolet B (UVB), from special lamps to treat people with severe cases. Risks linked to phototherapy include burning (usually resembling a mild sunburn ), dry skin , itchy skin, freckling, and potential premature aging of the skin. Your health care professionals will work with you to lessen any risks. Anti-itch products or allergy medications such as antihistamines . Antihistamines, such as Diphenhydramine or Benadryl , can help soothe the itchiness. Immunosuppressive medications. Medications including steroid shots, prednisone, or other drugs can help clear up a rash by suppressing your immune system. Complications of Rashes Rashes on the skin aren't usually problematic and respond well to treatment. Some possible complications include: Infection. When you scratch an itchy rash, it opens your skin. This allows pathogens such as bacteria to enter, putting you at risk of infection. Anaphylaxis. In addition to a skin rash, some people can have a severe allergic reaction that is life-threatening, also known as anaphylaxis. The extreme swelling that happens in anaphylaxis can close your air passages. An immediate injection with epinephrine (EpiPen) is needed to act against the allergic reaction. If you have an itchy feeling in your mouth or throat with your skin rash, talk to your doctor about the need for an EpiPen. How to Prevent Rashes There are ways to lessen your risk and prevent flare-ups such as those associated with atopic eczema : Reduce stress . Avoid scratchy materials (for example, wool) and chemicals that can be triggers, such as harsh soaps, detergents, and solvents. Moisturize often. Avoid sudden changes in temperature or humidity. Avoid situations that cause sweating and overheating. Immediately wash your hands when you come into contact with something you're allergic to."
9,Raynaud’s Disease and Raynaud’s Syndrome,"What Is Raynaud's Disease? Raynaud’s disease is when blood vessels in your fingers and toes temporarily overreact to low temperatures or stress . For most people, it isn’t a serious health problem. But for some, the reduced blood flow can cause damage. Types of Raynaud’s This condition is named for the French doctor who first identified it in 1862. You may hear it called by many names. There are two types: Primary Raynaud’s (or Raynaud’s disease) happens without any other illness behind it. The symptoms are often mild. Secondary Raynaud’s (Raynaud’s syndrome, Raynaud’s phenomenon) results from another illness. It’s often a condition that attacks your body’s connective tissues, like lupus or rheumatoid arthritis . It’s less common, but it’s more likely to cause serious health problems. This can include things like skin sores and gangrene . These happen when cells and tissue in your toes and fingers die from lack of blood. Raynaud’s Symptoms You might notice: Cold fingers and toes Your skin might turn white or blue when it’s cold or when you’re stressed. As you warm up, it could turn red. Your fingers and toes feel tingly or prickly when they start to warm up. What Causes Primary Raynaud’s? When it’s cold, your body tries to conserve heat. One way it does that is to slow down blood flow to the areas farthest from your heart -- your hands and feet . To do that, the network of small arteries that carry blood to those points gets narrower, moving them away from your skin. This is called the vasomotor response. If you have Raynaud’s, your response is off. Those arteries shrink more than normal, and faster than normal. That can make your fingers and toes feel numb and change color to white or blue. This usually lasts about 15 minutes. When the arteries relax and your body warms back up, your fingers feel tingly and turn red before returning to normal. You might have changes to genes that control your response, but doctors haven’t found a link between this and Raynaud’s. What Causes Secondary Raynaud’s? Secondary Raynaud’s works the same, but you get it as the result of another disease. Conditions that make you likely to get secondary Raynaud’s include: Connective tissue diseases. If you have scleroderma , a rare disease that causes your skin to harden and scar, you’ll probably have Raynaud's. Lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and Sjogren's syndrome also make it more likely. Artery disease. This includes atherosclerosis , or plaque buildup in the blood vessels that feed your heart ; Buerger's disease , which causes inflammation in the blood vessels of your hands and feet; and a primary pulmonary hypertension , a type of high blood pressure that affects the arteries in your lungs . Carpal tunnel syndrome. Pressure on a major nerve to your hand can cause numbness, pain, and make you more sensitive to the cold. Repetitive action or vibration. Any movement you make over and over, like typing or playing the piano, can cause an overuse injury. So can using tools that vibrate, like jackhammers. Smoking . It narrows your blood vessels. Injuries: This includes damage to your hands or feet from breaks, surgery, or frostbite . Certain medications . These include high blood pressure treatments like beta-blockers; migraine meds with ergotamine or sumatriptan ; ADHD medications ; some types of chemotherapy ; and drugs that narrow your blood vessels, like over-the-counter cold medications. Risk Factors for Raynaud’s As many as one in 10 people may have some form of Raynaud’s. Most have primary Raynaud’s. About one person in 100, or fewer, will have secondary Raynaud’s. Women are up to nine times more likely to get it than men. People of all ages can get primary Raynaud’s, but it usually shows up between ages 15 and 25. People with secondary Raynaud’s tend to get it after 35. People with illnesses like rheumatoid arthritis , scleroderma, and lupus are more likely to get secondary Raynaud’s. People who use some medicines to treat cancer , migraines , or high blood pressure may be more likely to get Raynaud’s. Also, people who have carpal tunnel syndrome or use vibrating tools like jackhammers may be more likely to get Raynaud’s. How Is Raynaud’s Diagnosed? If your doctor thinks you have Raynaud’s, they’ll ask questions about your symptoms and look at your fingers and toes. They might also use a special magnifying glass called a dermoscope to check the blood vessels around your fingernails to see if they’re larger than normal or oddly shaped. If the doctor thinks your condition results from another health problem, they might take some of your blood to test in a lab. This lets them check for signs of an autoimmune disorder like lupus or rheumatoid arthritis. What Are Treatments for Raynaud’s? Treatment goals will include preventing attacks or limiting them when they do happen. That usually means keeping your hands and feet warm and dry, controlling stress , and getting regular exercise . Medication Your doctor might ask you to avoid some drugs, including over-the-counter cold medicines that contain pseudoephedrine . They can make your symptoms worse by causing your blood vessels to narrow. If you have secondary Raynaud’s, your doctor might prescribe medicines to control your blood pressure and relax your blood vessels. If you get sores on your skin as a result, you might need to apply a cream that contains one of these drugs. They include: Calcium channel blockers. Examples include nifedipine ( Afeditab CR, Procardia ), amlodipine ( Norvasc ), felodipine , and isradipine. Vasodilators. These include the high blood pressure drug losartan (Cozaar), the erectile dysfunction medication sildenafil ( Viagra , Revatio), the antidepressant fluoxetine ( Prozac , Sarafem ), and a class of medications called prostaglandins. Others include a nitroglycerin cream you can put on the base of your fingers to help heal sores. Surgery If your condition doesn’t improve after these steps and you’re at risk of severe problems, like losing parts of your fingers or toes, your doctor might consider surgery. These procedures involve cutting the nerves to the blood vessels in your skin to limit how much they open and close. The doctor might also inject drugs into your hands or feet to block those nerves. Home Treatment for Raynaud’s These steps can also help you control your condition: Avoid smoke: Don’t smoke, and stay away from secondhand smoke , too. It can make your blood vessels close up, which lowers your skin temperature. Exercise : It’ll boost your circulation. If you have secondary Raynaud’s, check with your doctor before you try an outdoors workout in cold weather. Manage stress : Keeping it under control could help cut the number of attacks. Keep your temperature constant: Don’t go straight from a chilly space to a warm space if you can help it. Avoid the frozen-food section of the grocery store as much as possible. Dress for the cold: Wear layers, gloves, and heavy socks. Buy chemical warmers for your pockets, gloves, and socks. Avoid some medications: Decongestants with phenylephrine , diet pills , migraine medications with ergotamine, herbal medications with ephedra, and the blood pressure medication clonidine (Catapres) can all narrow your blood vessels. Soak your hands: Or run warm water over them when you feel an attack starting. Can Raynaud’s Kill You? No, but serious cases can cut off the blood flow to your skin and lead to tissue damage. A completely blocked artery can lead to skin sores (ulcers) or dead tissue (gangrene). It’s rare, but if this happens, the doctor might have to remove a finger or toe."
10,How to Treat and Prevent Folliculitis,"What Is Folliculitis? Folliculitis is a skin problem that happens when you get bacteria or a blockage in a tiny pocket in your skin called a hair follicle. You have hair follicles just about everywhere except your lips, your palms, and the soles of your feet. Folliculitis can make these hair follicles red and swollen. You can get this condition anywhere you have hair, but it’s most likely to show up on your neck, thighs, buttocks, or armpits. You can often treat it yourself, but for more severe cases, you may need to see your doctor. Different kinds of folliculitis have other names you might have heard, such as: Barber’s itch Hot tub rash Razor bumps Shaving rash How often does folliculitis occur? Folliculitis is very common. People of any age can get it – adults, teens, children, and even babies. Some groups of people are more likely to get certain types of folliculitis. For instance, if you have a beard that you often trim, you’re more prone to having inflamed skin on your chin and cheeks. In general, you’re at higher risk for folliculitis if you have a high body weight, live with diabetes, take antibiotics for a long time, or have a weak or suppressed immune system. Is folliculitis contagious? Most of the time, folliculitis isn’t spread from person to person. But there are a few exceptions. If your folliculitis is caused by a germ that lives naturally in water or soil, it could infect other people, too. If you get a rash after sitting in a hot tub, other people who sat in the tub are also likely to get it. Some folliculitis is caused by a contagious type of bacteria called staphylococcus, or staph. If you have a cut on your skin and touch something, like a towel, that has this germ on it, you may get infected. If so, you’ll be contagious until you’ve been treated with antibiotics for at least 48 hours. If any of your hair follicles contain pus, wash your hands for 20 to 30 seconds after touching the infected area. Until it's healed, don’t share clothes or towels with others. Folliculitis Symptoms Your symptoms will vary based on the exact type of folliculitis you have and how bad it is. You may have: Groups of small bumps like pimples, some with whiteheads on them Blisters that break open, ooze, and become crusty Large areas of swollen skin that may leak pus These areas of your skin may be itchy, tender, and painful as well. Razor bumps (pseudofolliculitis barbae) develop after shaving, when strands of hair curl back on themselves and grow into the skin. (Photo credit: VisualDxHealth) Types of Folliculitis There are two main types of folliculitis. Superficial folliculitis is when only part of the hair follicle is damaged, while deep folliculitis is when the whole follicle is damaged. Within these two categories, there are several subtypes: Bacterial folliculitis The most common form of folliculitis, it causes itchy, white bumps filled with pus. You can get it if you cut yourself and bacteria (usually staph) gets in. Hot tub folliculitis (pseudomonas folliculitis) You get this from swimming in a pool or sitting in a hot tub where pH or chlorine levels aren’t balanced. You’ll see a rash of round, itchy bumps a day or so after being in the water. Pityrosporum folliculitis This type happens along with a yeast infection. It causes itchy, pus-filled pimples that show up on your upper body, mostly on your back and chest, but you can also have them on your neck, shoulders, arms, and face. Folliculitis decalvans This is a rare type of scalp folliculitis. If bacteria inflame your hair follicles for a long time, your immune system may attack them, leading to hair loss. Doctors aren’t sure what causes this type. Malassezia folliculitis Malassezia is a type of yeast naturally found on your skin. If too much grows, it can get into a hair follicle and make your skin itchy. You’re more likely to have this type if your skin is oily, you have dandruff, or you sweat a lot. Eosinophilic folliculitis This type typically affects babies or people with conditions that affect their immune systems. It causes itchy, pus-filled bumps, most often on the shoulders, upper arms, neck, and forehead. Razor bumps (pseudofolliculitis barbae) This type is caused by ingrown hairs linked to shaving or a bikini wax. You’ll have dark bumps, or keloids, on your face or neck after shaving or in your groin area after a wax. It's more common in men of African and Asian descent. Other types include: Sycosis barbae: This is when the whole hair follicle gets infected after shaving. It causes large, pus-filled bumps and can sometimes lead to scarring. Gram-negative folliculitis: This type is caused by the use of long-term antibiotics to treat acne. It happens if the bacteria become resistant to the antibiotics and make the acne worse. Boils and carbuncles: A boil (a bump that can be tender or painful) happens when a hair follicle is seriously infected. A carbuncle is a cluster of several boils. Folliculitis Locations This condition can show up on any part of your body with hair follicles, even if it’s hard to see. Some common areas include: Folliculitis on your butt Anything from wearing tight clothes to waxing can cause folliculitis to show up on your backside. Sometimes it may show up as a single, red pimple. Or it could appear as a widespread rash. Scalp folliculitis While this is rare, the hair follicles on your head can become inflamed. This type of folliculitis can cause round or oval-shaped bald spots. Your scalp may also itch, feel tight, or be painful. Folliculitis on your legs Small bumps, sometimes full of pus, can show up on your legs, especially your thighs. They may itch or hurt. Folliculitis on your face If you shave, “razor bumps” can show up on your cheeks, chin, and neck. When they get infected, these small spots can get bigger and fill with pus. Folliculitis can also show up on other parts of your face, like your forehead. That’s often because a hair follicle has become blocked up with bacteria. Folliculitis on y our chest and back What might look like acne in these areas could be a type of folliculitis. You may itch a lot, and notice that getting sweaty makes these bumps worse. This type is fairly common in teens. That’s because as you go through puberty, your oil glands start working harder. If your immune system is weakened, you could see another type of folliculitis on your chest and neck, as well as your arms. The bumps may clear up for a while, then come back. Babies often get folliculitis on their chest and back, too. Folliculitis in the groin area You can get folliculitis “down there” because of waxing, shaving, or plucking. Wearing clothing that rubs against your skin can also lead to painful pimples in your underwear area. Folliculitis Causes and Risk Factors Staph bacteria is most often to blame. You have staph on your skin all the time, and it normally doesn’t cause any issues. But if it gets inside your body, say through a cut, it can cause problems. These other things can also cause folliculitis: Blockages from skin products, such as moisturizers with oils A fungus Hair removal, such as shaving, waxing, and plucking Ingrown hairs Other bacteria, such as the kind you might find in a hot tub Some drugs , such as corticosteroids that are used to ease inflammation In general, you’re more likely to get the condition if you have damaged follicles. This can happen from things such as shaving, skin injuries, sticky bandages, and tight clothes. You also might be more likely to have folliculitis if you: Have acne, especially if you use a steroid cream or long-term antibiotic for it Are a man who has curly hair and shaves Wear tight clothes, rubber gloves, or boots that don’t let sweat or heat out Spend time in a pool or hot tub that’s not cleaned regularly Have an illness that affects your immune system, like diabetes, leukemia, or HIV or AIDS When to See a Doctor Most of the time, folliculitis goes away with a little self-care at home. But let your doctor know If you have: Firm, painful bumps Pus drainage Bumps that are spreading Fever Chills Fatigue (feeling tired) A rash that clears up, then comes back A rash that gets worse Folliculitis Diagnosis Your doctor can usually tell if you have it by looking at your skin closely and asking questions about your medical history. They may ask about things like: Whether you've been in a hot tub How often you shave What medications you use How much you tend to sweat You don’t usually need tests unless treatments don’t work. In that case, your doctor may: Use a swab to take a culture from one of your sores so a lab can determine what's causing the infection Scrape your skin and send the sample to a lab to be checked for yeast In rare cases, do a biopsy to rule out more serious issues Self-Care for Folliculitis Mild folliculitis might go away without any medical treatment. To help yourself heal and ease symptoms, you can: Clean the infected area. Wash twice a day with warm water and antibacterial soap. Be sure to use a fresh cloth and towel each time. Use salt. Put warm saltwater – 1 teaspoon table salt mixed with 2 cups of water – on a washcloth and place it on your skin. You can also try this with a solution of water and white vinegar. Try gels, creams, and washes. Use over-the-counter antibiotics that you rub on your skin. If you’re itchy, you can try oatmeal lotion or hydrocortisone cream. It also helps to avoid shaving, scratching, and wearing tight or rough clothes on the infected area. To help your skin heal, you can: Change your habits. Stop doing whatever may have inflamed your hair follicles. For instance, you may need to stop plucking, using a hot tub, or wearing your favorite leggings for a while. Apply warm compresses. Try moist heat on the area three to four times a day, for 15 to 20 minutes each time. This will speed up the healing process. Try not to scratch. Although the area may be itchy, scratching could open up the follicle and either cause or worsen an infection. Don’t squeeze, pop, or cut open bumps. This can spread infection. Folliculitis Treatment If these self-care treatments don’t work, your doctor may give you medications or recommend other treatments. These include: Antibiotics Your doctor can prescribe infection-fighting lotions or gels if your folliculitis is caused by bacteria. If you have a serious infection, or if it keeps coming back, they can give you antibiotic pills to fight infection. Antifungals If you have fungal folliculitis, your doctor may prescribe antifungal shampoos, creams, or pills Steroids For eosinophilic folliculitis, your doctor may recommend a steroid cream to help with itching. Draining the infected follicle In severe cases, your doctor may make a small cut in an infected follicle to help it drain and heal. Laser hair removal If you have razor bumps that haven't responded to treatment, one option is to replace shaving with laser hair removal treatments. You'll probably need several treatments over a period of time. How long does it take folliculitis to go away? How long it takes your skin to clear up will depend on the type of folliculitis you have and the steps you and/or your doctor take to treat it. If it’s a simple case, your skin should start to improve in 7-10 days. But sometimes, folliculitis can be more stubborn. It could take longer to clear up if you’re not sure what’s causing it. It might not respond right away to a certain type of medicine, or it might go away and come back. In some cases, it may take a few months before your skin is back to normal. Folliculitis Complications Most of the time, folliculitis clears up without any issues. But sometimes, longer-term problems can crop up. You might have scarring once your skin clears up. Or you could notice that the skin in the affected area is lighter or darker than your usual skin tone. Depending on the cause of your folliculitis, you could also lose hair that doesn’t grow back. Folliculitis that’s due to an infection sometimes clears up, then returns. It can also spread to other areas. Folliculitis that’s caused by staph can start to grow inside your body. Over time, it can spread to your organs and blood. While this is uncommon, it can be deadly if not treated right away. If your doctor needs to treat your folliculitis with antibiotics, you could also have side effects from the drug. Folliculitis Prevention To lower your chances of getting folliculitis, your best bet is to stop shaving for at least 3 months. But for a lot of people, that won’t do. You might want to try an electric razor or other hair removal methods, such as depilatories. If those don’t work for you, then follow these steps for shaving: Wash your skin with warm water and a gentle cleanser. Apply plenty of gel or shaving cream, not soap, and let it sit 5-10 minutes to soften your hair. Use a new blade each time you shave so you know it’s clean and sharp; single blades are ideal. Shave in the direction your hairs grow. Rinse with warm water and use moisturizing lotion. Shave only every other day. Another way to avoid folliculitis is to limit your use of oils and other greasy skin products. These can cause blockages and trap bacteria. Other things you can do: Dip into hot tubs only if you know for sure they are clean and well-maintained. Use clean towels, razors, and other personal care items, and avoid sharing them with anyone else. Wash your hands often. Avoid getting too close to others who have folliculitis. They may pass on their germs without realizing it. Talk to your doctor about trying anti-dandruff shampoo. If your folliculitis is caused by yeast, using the shampoo on itchy parts of your skin may make a difference. Avoid clothes that irritate your skin or trap heat and sweat, such as Lycra, rubber gloves, and high boots. Instead, choose loose clothing made with fabrics (like cotton) that let your skin breathe. This will cut back on sweat and friction. Remove and rinse off your swimsuit as soon as you get out of a hot tub or pool. Do laundry often. Wash towels, sheets, and sweaty clothing in hot, soapy water to kill germs. Takeaways Folliculitis is a common and usually minor skin problem. Most of the time, it clears up with self-care at home. See your doctor if it doesn't clear up within a couple of weeks, or if your symptoms are serious.. Folliculitis FAQs What triggers folliculitis? Bacteria and fungi are common triggers for folliculitis. So are heavy or oily skin products and hair removal techniques like shaving and waxing. What kills folliculitis bacteria? Washing with warm water and antibacterial soap is often enough to clean and help heal the area. You can also try a saltwater solution, or vinegar mixed with water. Over-the-counter antibiotic creams often work as well. If none of these things does the trick, your doctor can prescribe an antibiotic you apply to your skin."
11,Renal Cell Carcinoma,"What Is Renal Cell Carcinoma? It's the most common type of kidney cancer . Although it’s a serious disease, finding and treating it early makes it more likely that you’ll be cured. No matter when you’re diagnosed, you can do certain things to ease your symptoms and feel better during your treatment. Most people who have renal cell carcinoma are older, usually between ages 50 and 70. It often starts as just one tumor in a kidney , but sometimes it begins as several tumors, or it’s found in both kidneys at once. You might also hear it called renal cell cancer . Doctors have different ways to treat renal cell carcinoma, and scientists are testing new ones, too. You’ll want to learn as much about your disease as you can and work with your doctor so you can choose the best treatment. Causes Scientists aren’t sure exactly what causes renal cell carcinoma. They know that most kidney cancers start when something goes wrong in the genes in the kidney. No one can say for certain why that happens. Several things can raise your chances of getting the disease, like: Smoking Being very overweight Taking a lot of pain medicine, like aspirin , ibuprofen , or acetaminophen , for a long time Having hepatitis C Exposure to certain dyes, asbestos , cadmium (a metal), herbicides, and solvents Having acquired cystic kidney disease (especially in dialysis patients) Some inherited conditions, especially von Hippel- Lindau disease Symptoms Early on, renal cell carcinoma doesn’t usually cause any symptoms. As the disease gets more serious, you might have warning signs like: A lump on your side, belly, or lower back Blood in your pee Low back pain on one side Losing weight for no clear reason Not feeling hungry Fever Feeling tired Not enough red blood cells ( anemia ) Night sweats High levels of calcium in your blood High blood pressure Getting a Diagnosis Your doctor will want to find out more about your symptoms to figure out what’s going on. First, they’ll give you a physical exam and ask you questions like: When did you first notice a problem? Is there blood in your urine? Have you been having any pain? Where? Does anything make your symptoms better or worse? Has anyone in your family had von Hippel-Lindau disease? What about kidney cancer? From there, they’ll do some tests that could include: Urine tests Blood tests Biopsy Tests to see how well your liver is working Ultrasound , which uses sound waves to make a picture of the organs inside your body CT scan , a test that uses a powerful X-ray to make detailed pictures inside your body Nephrectomy, when doctors remove part of one of your kidneys, or sometimes the whole kidney, to check it for renal cell carcinoma . You’ll have this test if your doctor has already spotted a tumor, but doesn’t know if it’s cancer . If the results show that you have renal cell carcinoma, your doctor will find out what stage it’s in, so you can decide on the best treatment options. The stage of cancer depends on how large your tumor is and whether the cancer has spread to other parts of your body. You may have tests to take a closer look inside your chest and belly, like: Chest X-ray CT scan MRI , which uses powerful magnets and radio waves to make pictures of the inside of your body Bone scan Questions to Ask Your Doctor What stage is my cancer? What does that mean for me? Do I need any more tests? Do I need to see any other doctors? Have you ever treated this kind of cancer before? What kinds of treatments are there? Which would you recommend? How will those treatments make me feel? When should I start treatment? How will we know if it works? What will my recovery be like? What would you expect for me? Are there any clinical trials I can sign up for? Treatment There are a few different ways doctors can treat renal cell carcinoma. You may need to try several before finding one that works. The best plan for you depends on the stage of your cancer, how healthy you are overall, and any side effects you might have. Your options may include: Surgery to remove part or all of the kidney Biologic drugs, which boost your body’s own defenses to fight cancer cells Drugs such as interferon -alfa or interleukin-2 Targeted therapy -- treatments that attack specific things cancers need to survive, like a tumor’s blood vessels or certain proteins; these include axitinib (Inlyta), bevacizumab ( Avastin ), cabozantinib ( Cometriq ), everolimus ( Afinitor ), lenvatinib ( Lenvima ), nivolumab ( Opdivo ), pazopanib ( Votrient ), sorafenib ( Nexavar ), sunitinib ( Sutent ), and temsirolimus ( Torisel ). Ablation. This uses extreme cold or radio waves to destroy tumors. Many kinds of cancer are treated with radiation or chemotherapy , or sometimes both. These treatments usually don’t work well for renal cell carcinoma. In some cases, your doctor may still prescribe them to ease your symptoms or if other treatments haven’t worked. Talk with them about these options and how they might make you feel. Scientists also are looking for new ways to treat renal cell carcinoma in clinical trials. These trials test new drugs to see if they're safe and if they work. They often are a way for people to try new medicine that isn't available to everyone. Your doctor can tell you if one of these trials might be a good fit for you. It’s important to treat your disease, but also to make sure you're comfortable. Tell your doctor if you’re feeling any pain. They can give you medicines to ease your symptoms. Taking Care of Yourself You can do things during and after your treatment to feel stronger physically and emotionally. Eat well. You need calories and nutrients to stay strong for treatment. If it’s hard for you to eat, try smaller meals every few hours instead of three big meals. Keep moving. Exercise is good for your body and your mind. Your treatment may leave you feeling tired, so be sure to balance activity with rest. Follow your treatment plan. Keep your doctor in the loop about any changes in how you’re feeling. Get support. It’s important to take care of your emotional health, too. Trained counselors and support groups can offer safe places to talk about how you and your loved ones feel. Also, ask for help from family, friends, and members of your community. What to Expect Your outlook depends on the stage of your disease. The earlier you find and treat renal cell carcinoma, the better your progress will be. Treatment helps many people fight the cancer, and you have several good options to ease pain and other symptoms.

12,Reactive Attachment Disorder,"What Is Reactive Attachment Disorder? Reactive attachment disorder (RAD) is a condition found in children who may have had grossly negligent care and don’t form healthy emotional attachments with their primary caregivers -- usually their mothers -- before age 5. Attachment develops when a child is repeatedly soothed, comforted, and cared for, and when the caregiver consistently meets the child's needs. It is through attachment with a loving and protective caregiver that a young child learns to love and trust others, to become aware of others' feelings and needs, to regulate their emotions, and to develop healthy relationships and a positive self-image. The absence of emotional warmth during the first few years of life can negatively affect a child's future. Reactive Attachment Disorder Symptoms RAD can affect every aspect of a child's life and development. When babies and young children have RAD they may: Not respond to others with the range of emotions that you’d expect Not express emotions of conscience, such as remorse, guilt, or regret Not make eye contact Avoid physical touch, especially from caregivers Have tantrums or be more irritable, disobedient, or prone to argue than you’d expect for their age and situation Be unhappy or sad without a clear cause When children get older their RAD tends to take on two patterns, inhibited and disinhibited. Common symptoms with inhibited RAD include: Detachment Unresponsiveness or resistance to comforting Excessive inhibition (holding back emotions) Withdrawal or a mixture of approach and avoidance Failure to seek affection from caregivers and other people A tendency to keep to themselves Common symptoms with disinhibited RAD include: Indiscriminate sociability Inappropriate familiarity or selective in the choice of attachment figures No preference for their primary caregivers over other people A tendency to act younger than their age and to seek affection in potentially dangerous ways Reactive Attachment Disorder Causes and Risk Factors RAD develops when attachment between a young child and their primary caregiver doesn’t happen or is interrupted due to grossly negligent care. This can happen for many reasons, including: Constant disregard of the child's emotional needs for comfort, stimulation, and affection Constant disregard of the child's basic physical needs Repeated changes of primary caregivers that prevent them forming stable attachments (for example, frequent changes in foster care) Other risk factors for RAD include these home and parental situations: Live in a children’s home or other institutions Parents have serious mental health conditions or abuse drugs or alcohol Parents take part in criminal behavior Parents or caregivers are hospitalized and separated from the child for long periods How Common Is Reactive Attachment Disorder? It’s hard to know exactly how many children have RAD, since many families never seek help. However, it’s generally believed that RAD is uncommon. Reactive Attachment Disorder Diagnosis As with adults, mental disorders in children are diagnosed based on signs and symptoms that suggest a particular condition. If a child has symptoms, the doctor may do a complete medical history and physical exam , including a review of the child’s developmental milestones. There are no lab tests to diagnose RAD, but the doctor may use various tests to see what may be causing the symptoms. Tests may include neuroimaging or blood tests, to see if physical illness or medication might be causing symptoms. If the doctor can’t find a physical cause for the symptoms, they will likely refer the child to a child and adolescent psychiatrist or psychologist . These mental health professionals are specially trained to diagnose and treat mental illnesses in children and teens . They’ll assess the child to rule out other causes for their unusual behavior, such as autism spectrum disorder. Psychiatrists and psychologists use specially designed interview and assessment tools to evaluate children for mental disorders. They base their diagnoses on what they’ve been told about the symptoms, and on observation of children’s attitudes and behaviors. Reactive Attachment Disorder Treatment Treatment of RAD has two important goals. The first is to ensure that the child is in a safe environment. This is especially important in cases where the child has been abused or neglected. The second goal is to help the child develop a healthy relationship with an appropriate caregiver. Treatment for RAD often focuses on the caregiver. Counseling may help address issues that are affecting the caregiver's relationship with -- and behavior toward -- the child. Teaching parenting skills also can help improve the relationship and develop attachment. Treatment may also include play therapy. This technique allows the child and the caregiver to express their thoughts, fears, and needs in the safe context of play. There is no medication to treat RAD itself. However, the doctor may sometimes use medication to help manage severe behavioral symptoms, such as explosive anger or problems sleeping. The use of so-called holding therapies and ""rebirthing"" techniques is controversial. There’s no scientific evidence to support the effectiveness of such interventions and some evidence that indicates that it is actually not safe. Reactive Attachment Disorder Prevention Recognizing a problem with attachment and getting help as soon as possible are essential to preventing RAD. It may not always be possible to prevent RAD, but doing these things may help stave off its development: Engage often with your child through play and frequent talk, eye contact, and smiles. Learn to understand your baby’s cues, such as what their different types of cries tell you about how they feel and what they need. Show warmth and nurture your child when you bathe or feed them or change their diapers. Respond to your child with a warm tone of voice and with caring facial expressions and physical touches. Take classes or volunteer with your child so you can build skills to nurture your child. Reactive Attachment Disorder Outlook If not treated, RAD can have a negative impact on a child's physical, emotional, behavioral, social, and moral development. Children with RAD generally are at higher risk for: Depression Aggressive and/or disruptive behavior Learning difficulties and behavior problems in school Inability to form meaningful relationships Low self-esteem Eating disorders Alcohol or drug dependence or abuse With treatment, it is possible for children with RAD to learn to trust others, and to lead healthy and productive lives."
13,Ichthyosis,"What Is Ichthyosis? Ichthyosis is a skin disorder in which skin cells don't properly separate or shed. This leaves behind rough, dark, scaly skin. (Photo credit: Science Source) Ichthyosis is a group of about 30 skin conditions that cause skin dryness and scaling. The condition gets its name from the Greek word for fish because the skin looks like fish scales. You might also hear it called fish scale or fish skin disease. People with this condition lose the protective barrier that keeps moisture in their skin. They also make new skin cells too quickly or shed old cells too slowly. This leads to a buildup of thick, scaly skin. Most cases of ichthyosis are mild, but it can be more severe. Some types of ichthyosis can affect your other organs, too. Ichthyosis can't be cured, but treatments can relieve the scaling and make you feel more comfortable. Types of Ichthyosis Some types only cause dry and scaly skin. Others cause problems inside the body, too. Ichthyosis has lots of types—more than 30. Most forms of the disease are very rare. They can go along with other conditions or syndromes. Some types include: Ichthyosis vulgaris . It's mild and affects about one out of every 250 people. Gray, brown, or white scales can show up usually in infancy. Most people with ichthyosis have this type. X-linked recessive ichthyosis. It affects about one out of 6,000 people, usually males. It starts at about 3-6 months and gets worse over time. You'll usually see scaling on the neck, face, trunk, and legs. Harlequin ichthyosis. You'll usually see this in newborns. It causes thick scaly plates all over the skin. It can change the way a newborn's face looks and can make it hard to move their joints. Epidermolytic ichthyosis. This type also happens in new babies. Infants with this type have fragile, blistered skin all over their bodies. Later, the blisters go away, and the skin gets scaly. Lamellar ichthyosis. Newborns with this have a clear membrane (collodion membrane) all over their bodies. After a few weeks, this covering peels away, leaving big, dark, plate-like scales. Congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma. This type is there at birth, too. Babies with this may also have a collodion membrane. Erythrokeratodermia variabilis. This type shows up in babies after a few months and can get worse or spread as they grow. Your skin may look rough, thick, or red, especially on the face, butt, arms, and legs. Progressive symmetric erythrokeratoderma. This type can start later in childhood compared with other types. You'll see dry, red, scaly skin, especially on the arms, legs, butt, face, ankles, and wrists. Ichthyosis Causes Ichthyosis can be genetic (or inherited). It also can be acquired, meaning it happens later because of another illness or from medicine you're taking. Inherited ichthyosis is a genetic condition. That means it's passed down to you from your parents. Sometimes, parents who don't have ichthyosis can still pass it down. Genes are the codes that tell your body to make proteins, which determine how your body looks and functions. When there are changes or mutations in a gene, it can cause disease. Ichthyosis gene mutations affect the proteins that protect your skin and keep it moist. They also affect how quickly your body gets rid of or grows new skin cells. Ichthyosis usually shows up in infancy or early childhood. If both of your parents have a mutation that can cause it, you're likely to have a more serious condition than if only one of them has it. Sometimes, ichthyosis is genetic without being inherited. This can happen when a new mutation comes up in a developing fetus. In this case, the baby won't have enough of a protein (filaggrin) they need for their outer skin layer. They also won't shed dead skin cells the way they should. Acquired ichthyosis shows up in adulthood. Doctors don't know why it happens, but people with it often have other conditions, including: Underactive thyroid gland Kidney disease Sarcoidosis , a rare disease that causes patches of inflammation inside the body Cancer such as Hodgkin's lymphoma HIV infection Some medicines might also trigger the condition, but it's rare. These include: Cancer drugs, such as hydroxyurea ( Droxia , Hydrea ) and vemurafenib ( Zelboraf ) Protease inhibitors, a group of drugs used to treat HIV infections Nicotinic acid , a vitamin that's used to treat high cholesterol Medicines for ulcers and acid reflux, such as cimetidine Clofazimine, which treats leprosy Ichthyosis Symptoms Your symptoms will depend on what type of ichthyosis it is. But 95% of people with it have ichthyosis vulgaris. It's possible to have ichthyosis and not even know it. You might just think you have dry skin. Dry, scaly skin is the main symptom. The scales form on only some parts of the body, such as the: Trunk Stomach Buttocks Legs Face and scalp The scales can be white, gray, or dark brown. They might have thick or thin cracks running through them. Dryness and scaling get worse in cold, dry weather. They usually improve in warmer weather. Other signs of ichthyosis vulgaris, the most common type, include: Itchy, dry skin Skin that's thick or rough and may look dirty, especially on the palms of your hands and soles of your feet White, gray, or brown scales Extra lines on the hands and feet that may be deep or even crack Rough and bumpy skin on the arms, thighs, and butt that may look like acne (keratosis pilaris) Trouble sweating Other, more severe signs of ichthyosis are: Skin redness Blisters that can break to cause wounds Peeling Itchiness Pain Lines on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet Tight skin that makes it hard to move Hair loss or hair that breaks easily Dry eyes that are hard to close Trouble hearing Trouble bending your joints Many people with ichthyosis also have eczema , a red, itchy rash . Ichthyosis usually shows up in babies or young kids before age 5. Symptoms may get worse until a child reaches puberty. Sometimes, it can get better with age. Your symptoms will depend on how severe your disease is and what's causing it. It usually doesn't go away, and you may need treatment to help with symptoms all your life. Ichthyosis Complications Skin is your body's barrier. It holds moisture inside and keeps out bacteria and other invaders that might make you sick. When ichthyosis makes pieces of your skin scale off, you lose some of this protective layer. Scaling can lead to complications such as: Skin infections Dehydration Blocked sweat glands, which can lead to overheating Slow hair growth from scales on the scalp or hair loss Burning more calories because the skin has to work harder to turn over cells Ichthyosis can cause emotional issues, too. The scales can affect the way you look. People with this condition sometimes feel depressed and have low self-esteem. Kids with ichthyosis are more likely to get: Eczema Asthma Hay fever Hives Men with ichthyosis are also at an increased risk of: Testicular cancer Undescended or hidden testicles Low sperm count Other complications include: Vision loss from damage to the cornea (the clear layer in the front of the eye ) Hearing loss Brain and nervous system problems Ichthyosis Diagnosis Sometimes it's so mild that it looks like regular dry skin . If the dryness and scaling bother you, see a dermatologist—a doctor who treats skin problems —for treatment. They may: Ask if other people in your family have any skin problems. Look at your skin, hair, and nails. Take a sample of skin to check under a microscope. This is called a biopsy . Test your blood or saliva for gene changes that cause certain types of ichthyosis. Ichthyosis Treatment It can't be cured, but treatments can help you manage dry and scaly skin. Rub cream, lotion, or ointment onto your skin every day to add moisture. Look for rich creams that have any of these ingredients: lanolin , alpha hydroxy acids, urea, or propylene glycol. Products with ceramides or cholesterol also keep skin moist. Apply the lotion right after you step out of the shower or bath, while your skin is still damp. This will help hold in moisture. Other things you can try: Take more than one bath a day to hydrate your skin. Take baths in salt water to help with burning, stinging, or itching. If you get infections often, try adding a little bit of bleach to your baths. Rub your skin with a pumice stone or rough sponge to help get rid of dead skin. Remove dead skin with a product that contains salicylic acid , glycolic acid, or lactic acid . If the dryness and scaling are severe, your doctor might prescribe an oral retinoid medicine such as acitretin ( Soriatane ) or isotretinoin ( Absorica , Claravis , Sotret , and others). Retinoids can cause side effects such as weakened bones, dry mouth , and upset stomach . You might need antibiotics for skin infections. If your skin condition is caused by another condition or medicine you're taking, treating the disease or changing the dose may help. Ichthyosis isn't life-threatening, but it can be life-changing. Your dermatologist can recommend treatments to help your skin look and feel better. If you feel depressed or have low self-esteem, talk to a therapist or other mental health experts. Ichthyosis Prevention You can't make ichthyosis go away. But there's a lot you can do to make it feel better and help with your symptoms. Some steps you can take include: Taking baths or other steps to add moisture to your skin. Staying cool. Heat and sweat can make it worse. Use a humidifier to keep heat and air conditioning from drying out your skin. Wear loose clothes that are cotton or another fabric that doesn't bother your skin. Avoid laundry detergents or other products with dyes and perfumes. It always helps to find other people with the same condition. They can be a source of support and have ideas for things to try. Look for a support group online or where you live with other people who have ichthyosis. If you're struggling with your skin condition, reach out to a mental health professional."
14,Reconstructive Surgery,"Do you have a child who was born with a birth defect, such as cleft lip or palate? Are you a woman who has undergone a mastectomy ? Or, perhaps you've experienced a traumatic injury or disease that has permanently affected some part of your body that you want fixed. Reconstructive surgery can help repair the part of your body that is affected from any of these issues. According to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, nearly 6.8 million reconstructive surgery procedures were performed in 2020 (the latest year for which statistics are available). What Are the Different Types of Reconstructive Surgeries? If you can imagine how many injuries, birth defects, or disfigurement issues arise in our imperfect lives, there is a procedure that can help improve the problem, whatever it may be. These include: Breast reconstruction or reduction. These procedures are available for women who have undergone a mastectomy or for women who have abnormally large breasts that are causing back problems or other related health issues; men also undergo breast reduction. Surgeries for feet and hands. This surgery is available for people affected by any number of maladies, including tumors (cancerous and non-cancerous) and webbed or extra toes or fingers. People also can receive treatment for carpal tunnel syndrome. Wound care . For individuals who have been severely burned or cut, skin grafts or other reconstructive techniques are available. Microsurgery or flap procedures. These surgeries can be performed to replace parts of the body affected by injury or disease, such as cancer . Facial surgeries. These can be performed to correct facial defects such as cleft lip, breathing problems such as snoring , or chronic infections, such as those that affect the sinuses . How Will the Surgeon Evaluate My Case? Like your issue that you want corrected, your procedure will be very individual. Your surgeon will take a detailed medical history and evaluate your case based on your desired results and medical necessity. For example, do you have a traumatic burn that affects underlying muscles and impacts your mobility? Have you had cancer and require surgery on multiple body parts? Your surgeon will help you weigh all the options and the two of you can decide together which one best suits you. Will Insurance Cover Reconstructive Surgery? Unlike elective cosmetic procedures, most insurance carriers cover the costs of reconstructive surgery, especially if you are experiencing a functional problem. To be safe, be sure to have your surgeon write a letter and take photos detailing your case."
15,Understanding Colorectal Cancer -- The Basics,"What Is Colorectal Cancer? Inside your abdominal cavity is the long, tubular digestive tract. The second part of this tube -- the large intestine -- is composed of the colon , which stretches 4 feet to 6 feet, and the rectum, which is only 4 inches to 6 inches long. The inner lining of this ""colorectal tube"" can be a fertile breeding ground for small tumors, called polyps (Figure 1). About a quarter of all adults in the U.S. older than age 50 will have at least one colorectal polyp. Most colorectal cancers develop from polyps in glandular tissue of the intestinal lining. Most polyps are benign, but at least one type is known to be precancerous. These are called adenomatous polyps. The size of the polyp correlates with the development of cancer . Polyps less than 1 centimeter in size have a slightly greater than a 1% chance of becoming cancer , but those 2 centimeters or greater have a 40% chance of transforming into cancer . Overall, the incidence is about 5%. Most colorectal cancers develop from polyps in glandular tissue of the intestinal lining. If colorectal cancer is diagnosed and treated early while the tumor is still localized, the disease is highly curable, with five-year survival rates of about 90%. If the tumor continues to grow, cancer can spread directly through the bowel wall to surrounding lymph nodes, tissues, and organs, as well as into the bloodstream. Once the cancer spreads to lymph nodes or other organs, successful treatment becomes more difficult. Depending on how advanced the disease is, five-year survival rates range from 11% to 87%. Cancers of the colon and rectum are common, with approximately 135,000 cases diagnosed each year. Like many cancers, colorectal cancer is of particular concern for people older than age 50. Although diagnosis is often possible at an early stage, many people delay seeking medical care because they are embarrassed or fearful of symptoms related to their bowels. Risk increases significantly after age 50 and continues to increase with age. What Causes Colorectal Cancer? The exact cause of colorectal cancer is not known. But there are several risk factors for the disease. Other diseases . Colorectal cancer is strongly associated with certain other diseases. Those people considered at high risk include anyone with a personal or family history of colon polyps or colon cancer, inflammatory disease of the colon such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease , and cancers of the pancreas , breast , ovaries, or uterus. Heredity . As with any cancer, susceptibility to colorectal cancer is at least partly determined by genetic makeup . A few people inherit medical conditions, such as familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), MYH-associated polyposis (MAP), Gardner's syndrome, Turcot's syndrome, Peutz-Jagher's syndrome, juvenile polyposis, and Cowden's disease. In all of these disorders, colon polyps develop at an early age, and unless treated, these people are at high risk of developing colorectal cancer. Hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer . The disease extends from generation to generation and causes a person to develop colon cancer. This disease is associated with other cancers including endometrial, ovarian, stomach, small intestine, pancreas, kidney, ureter, brain, and bile duct. Diet . Diet also contributes to the risk of colorectal cancer, although the cause-and-effect relationship is still unclear. People whose diets are high in fruits and vegetables seem to have a reduced risk. Many studies implicate animal fat and protein as promoters of colorectal cancer, although researchers are cautious about drawing any definite conclusions. Some studies show that regularly eating red meat, which is rich in saturated fat and protein, increases risk, while others find no connection. Some scientists note that fat is the main culprit, while others suspect protein. Others contend that it's not the fat and protein themselves, but the way they are cooked. They note that fats and protein cooked at high temperatures -- especially when broiled and barbecued -- can produce a host of potentially carcinogenic substances linked to colorectal cancer. Chemical exposure . Heavy exposure to certain chemicals, including chlorine -- which in small amounts is commonly used to purify drinking water -- may increase the risk of colorectal cancer. Exposure to asbestos is thought to be potentially harmful because it has been implicated in causing formation of polyps in the colon. History of certain types of surgery. Surgeries such as ureterosigmoidostomy, which is performed in the treatment of bladder cancer , and a cholecsytecomy (the removal of the gallbladder ). Some studies show surgery of the bladder may lead to a risk for colon cancer development, but other studies do not. History of colon cancer. A prior case of colon cancer increases the risk of a second colon cancer, especially if the first cancer was diagnosed before the age of 60. Lifestyle. Smoking and alcohol intake of more than 4 drinks per week increases the risk of developing colon cancer. Family history . Those with a first-degree relative with colorectal cancer have an increased risk of the disease. The risk increases if more than one first-degree relative has colon cancer. Radiation . Prior radiation increases the risk of cancer to the radiated tissue only."
16,Rectal Prolapse,"What Is Rectal Prolapse? If you are dealing with bowel incontinence as you age, you may have rectal prolapse. This happens when the lining of your rectum drops outside of your anus. (Photo Credit: Rob3000/Dreamstime) Prolapse is when any body part slips or falls down from its normal position. Rectal prolapse is when your rectum – the last section of your large intestine – drops down or slides out of your anus . (Some may call this prolapsed anus, but it's the rectum that drops.) Rectal prolapse is not usually considered a medical emergency. But the longer you have the condition, the worse it can get. Living with rectal prolapse can cause embarrassment and affect your quality of life. Rectal prolapse happens in about 2.5 out of every 1,000 people. It's more common in people assigned female at birth. You are more likely to have rectal prolapse after age 50, but it does happen in children who have issues like chronic diarrhea or cystic fibrosis. If you feel like something isn’t right when you go to the bathroom, or try to poop , you shouldn’t ignore it or make light of it. Your doctor can diagnose rectal prolapse and suggest treatment. Types of Rectal Prolapse There are three types of prolapse: External prolapse : The entire rectum sticks out of your anus. Mucosal prolapse : Part of the rectal lining pokes out of your anus. Internal prolapse : The rectum has started to drop but is not yet sticking out of your anus. Rectal Prolapse Symptoms If you feel like you’re sitting on a ball after pooping, or notice that you have something sticking out of the opening where you poop (your anus), you could have rectal prolapse. The first time you notice your rectum has dropped is usually after you have a bowel movement. When it first happens, the rectum may return inside on its own. Later, you may feel like something has fallen out of your body, or you just feel something down there that isn’t normal. In those cases, you may be able to push the rectum back in yourself. Additional symptoms of rectal prolapse can include: Feeling a bulge outside your anus Seeing a red mass outside your anal opening Pain in the anus or rectum Anal itching Constipation Not being able to control when you poop (fecal incontinence) Bleeding from the rectum Leaking blood, poop, or mucus from the anus Rectal prolapse vs. hemorrhoids Early on, rectal prolapse may look like hemorrhoids slipping out of your anal opening, but these are two different conditions. Hemorrhoids are swollen blood vessels in your anus or lower rectum that may cause itching, pain, and blood on the toilet paper when you wipe after you poop. Your doctor can diagnose whether you have rectal prolapse or hemorrhoids. Rectal Prolapse Causes A variety of things can cause rectal prolapse, including: Long-term history of diarrhea or constipation Cystic fibrosis, a condition that causes breathing and stomach problems Intestinal parasite infection Chronic coughing or sneezing Long-term history of having to strain when you poop Aging, which can lead to weakening of muscles and ligaments in the rectal area Previous injury to the anal or hip area Nerve damage that affects your muscles’ ability to tighten and loosen, which could be caused by pregnancy, vaginal childbirth complications, anal sphincter paralysis, or injury to your spine or back Neurological problems, such as spinal cord disease or spinal cord transection Rectal Prolapse Risk Factors Rectal prolapse is more common in people assigned female at birth, especially as they age. In general, older people who have had a history of constipation or problems with their pelvic floor have a higher chance of having a prolapsed rectum. Other things that put you at higher risk for rectal prolapse include: Chronic constipation Always having to strain to poop Lower back injury or disk disease Dementia Stroke Hysterectomy Muscle weakness in your anus or pelvic floor If someone in your family also had rectal prolapse Parasitic infections like schistosomiasis Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) Benign prostatic hypertrophy (growth of the prostate gland) Any injury or problems with ligaments that keep your rectum attached to the intestinal wall Congenital bowel disorders like Hirschsprung’s disease or neuronal intestinal dysplasia Rectal prolapse in children Rectal prolapse is not common in children, but it can happen to those with: Chronic constipation/straining while pooping Chronic diarrhea Poor nutrition Cystic fibrosis Spinal cord injury or a tethered cord Issues with the colon and pelvis like Hirschsprung's disease (a condition where a child's bowels don't have enough nerve cells so they can't pass waste, leading to blockages) Anal penetration, potentially from sexual abuse If your child has a prolapsed rectum, it can often be treated by their pediatrician. If they have a chronic condition like cystic fibrosis, they may need to see a specialist for more treatment or surgery. Rectal Prolapse Diagnosis It may be difficult for your doctor to know if you have hemorrhoids, another condition, or rectal prolapse. Because of this, your doctor may recommend one of several tests. These include: Digital rectal exam During this test, your doctor will place a gloved finger in your anus to check the strength of the muscles. Anal electromyography (EMG) This test checks to see if nerve damage is causing your anal sphincter problems. Anal manometry A thin tube is inserted into your rectum to test muscle strength. Anal ultrasound A probe inserted into your anus and rectum is used to examine muscles and tissues. Pudendal nerve terminal motor latency test It checks your pudendal nerves, which you use to control bowel movements. Proctography Also known as d efecography, this test uses an MRI or X-ray videos of your rectum when you poop to show how well it holds and releases feces. Colonoscopy A long tube inserted into your rectum with a tiny camera at the end can show the inside of your intestines and look for any problems that may be causing your prolapse. Proctosigmoidoscopy This test also uses a long tube with a camera on the end. It’s inserted deep into your intestines to look for inflammation, scarring, or a tumor. MRI This imaging scan examines all of the organs in your pelvic area. Lower GI series Also known as a barium enema, pictures of your lower gastrointestinal tract will be taken with X-rays. Rectal Prolapse Treatment If your rectal prolapse is very minor and it is caught early, your doctor might recommend rectal prolapse self-care that includes taking stool softeners to make it easier to go to the bathroom and pushing the rectum’s tissue back up the anus by hand. You may be able to use these solutions for several years without major problems. Sometimes children with rectal prolapse are cured by treating the cause – like chronic diarrhea or constipation. But in adults, the muscles don't repair on their own, and you will eventually need surgery to fix rectal prolapse. Rectal prolapse surgery is used to put the rectum back in place, and there are several types. The kind of surgery your doctor recommends will depend on things like your overall health, age, and the seriousness of your condition. The two most common types of surgery: Rectopexy This type of surgery is done through the belly area either with a large cut or using laparoscopy . With laparoscopy, small cuts are made in the belly, and a camera attached to an instrument lets the surgeon see what the problem is and if any other issues need to be fixed. Your surgeon will usually tack your rectum back in place with stitches or mesh. You will have general anesthesia for this procedure, which is needed for more severe cases of rectal prolapse. Rectopexy is successful in treating rectal prolapse in about 97% of cases. Perineal Also called rectal repair, this may be used if you are older, have minor prolapse, or if your rectum is stuck to the skin outside of the body. This surgery can involve the inner lining of the rectum or the portion of the rectum extending out of the anus. With perineal surgery, you may be able to have local anesthesia instead of going completely under. There are two main kinds of perineal surgery: In an Altemeier procedure , your doctor removes the prolapsed part of the rectum. The remaining part of your large intestine is your new rectum and is sewn together with the anus. With this procedure, there is the chance the rectum may prolapse again later. A Delorme procedure is usually recommended if you have a minor prolapse. Here, the doctor will remove the lining of the rectum, fold the muscle wall back in, and attach it to the anal canal with stitches. Risks The risks involved with rectal prolapse surgery include: Bleeding Infection Sexual dysfunction Bowel obstruction or constipation that gets worse Damage to nearby nerves and organs Rectal prolapse returning (this happens in about 2%-5% of people who have surgery) Recovery You will spend a short time in the hospital, maybe just overnight. You will drink liquids and then move to solid foods. Your doctor will want to make sure your bowel movements return to normal. To avoid constipation and rectal prolapse return, your doctor will have you drink lots of water, eat plenty of fiber , and use stool softeners. You should be able to return to normal activities 4-6 weeks after surgery. Rectal Prolapse Prevention To reduce rectal prolapse, try not to strain when you poop. Things that can also ease or prevent constipation that leads to straining include: Increasing your fiber intake by aiming for at least five servings of fruits and veggies each day Drinking 6-8 glasses of water a day Getting regular exercise Keeping your weight at a healthy level or losing weight if you need to If you have constipation often, talk to your doctor. They may direct you to take a stool softener or laxative. Also, avoid heavy lifting, as this could put pressure on your bowel muscles . Rectal Prolapse Complications Rectal prolapse, if it’s not treated, could lead to these complications: Rectal damage like ulceration or bleeding Becoming unable to manually push your rectum back inside your body Strangulation, or the blood supply in your rectum is reduced Gangrene, or the strangulated rectal tissue decays and dies A harder time holding in gas and poop (This happens in about 50%-75% of people with rectal prolapse.) Constipation"
17,Relapsed/Recurrent Multiple Myeloma,"If you have multiple myeloma , there’s a good chance it will come back after successful treatment. When this happens, it’s called recurrent or relapsed. If it doesn’t respond to treatment or comes back within 60 days after your last therapy, it’s known as refractory. You’ll probably have a lot of questions and concerns. It’s important to know that treatment options are available, even if your cancer returns. And while you can’t completely avoid a relapse, you may be able to spot certain signs and symptoms earlier, which could lead to better care. Why Does a Relapse Happen? Multiple myeloma is cancer that grows in your plasma cells -- special white blood cells that make antibodies (special proteins) to fight infection. Treatment kills most of the myeloma cells in your body, but a few can still survive. Doctors call the small number of cells that stick around after treatment minimal residual disease (MRD). These cells may eventually grow and divide, which leads to a relapse. Doctors can look for changes in your MRD over time to predict how long your treatment will work. Two techniques are currently used to measure MRD- Genetic Sequence Analysis: Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) and Flow cytometry: Next Generation Flow (NGF). Only NGS is an FDA-approved test, and researchers are still learning how to best use these tests. What Are My Chances of Relapse? Because this condition is rarely curable, nearly all people who have it and live through treatment will have a relapse at some point. It can come back in the same place it started or in other areas of your body. Most people who have it go through cycles of remission (when doctors can’t spot signs of it on tests) and relapse. Your doctor can help you understand what type you have. Types of Relapse There are two types of multiple myeloma relapses, and doctors handle them differently: Indolent or low risk : This happens more slowly, often over years. Your doctor might try a treatment you’ve already had. Aggressive or high risk: This one comes up quickly, within weeks or months. Your doctor may suggest a new therapy. How Will I Know I’ve Relapsed? Your doctor will order tests to check the status of your cancer while you’re in remission. They might include: Physical exam Blood or urine test Computed tomography (CT) scan Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) Bone scan Bone marrow biopsy Abnormal results could mean that the condition has returned. Also, when your disease comes back, the same problems you had when you were first diagnosed might crop up again. Or you might have new problems. Some common symptoms are: Bone pain Bone breaks Fever Fatigue Weight loss Easy bruising Trouble breathing Weakness in the arms or legs What to Do After Relapse: Treatment Options There are lots of options if you have a relapse. The most common include: Chemotherapy . This medication kills cancer cells in your body. If your multiple myeloma comes back, you might get a higher dose or a different course of drugs, such as: Cyclophosphamide ( Cytoxan , Neosar ) Doxorubicin ( Adriamycin , Rubex ) Melphalan ( Alkeran ) Melphalan flufenamide ( Pepaxto ) Vincristine ( Oncovin , Vincasar , Vincrex) Your doctor may also try high-dose steroids alone. Stem cell transplant. The high doses of chemo or radiation used to treat a multiple myeloma relapse can kill the stem cells in your bone marrow. To protect them, your doctor removes stem cells, usually from your hip. They’ll use a big needle to pull out the liquid marrow while you’re asleep. The cells are frozen and returned to your body by a vein after your treatment. Targeted therapies . These medications target specific parts of cells that help cancer cells grow, divide, or spread. The following drugs can be given alone or as part of a 3-drug combination treatment for recurrent multiple myeloma include: Monoclonal antibodies (daratumumab, elotuzumab, isatuximab) Proteasome inhibitors (bortezomib, carfilzomib, ixazomib), Iimmunomodulatory drugs (lenalidomide, pomalidomide, thalidomide) Alkylators Anthracyclines Panobinostat ( Farydak ) Selinexor ( Xpovio ) Corticosteroids About one-fourth of people with relapsed multiple myeloma will go into remission after several cycles of chemo. Those who get targeted therapies or high-dose chemo followed by a stem cell transplant usually have better outcomes. Clinical trial . You might want to consider this if your cancer comes back . These studies give you the chance to try new treatments that aren’t otherwise available. Supportive care. Your doctor may also offer this to ease your symptoms or manage complications. Talk to Your Doctor If you have a relapse, you and your doctor will work together to come up with the best treatment strategy. You might have a lot of questions. Here are some to ask: What treatment approach do you recommend? Why do you think I should have this treatment? What are my other options? How will the treatment affect my daily life? What are the chances that my cancer will come back? How long do you think this treatment will work? What will we do if the cancer comes back after this treatment? Are there any clinical trials I should consider? Can I Prevent a Relapse? You can’t prevent a relapse entirely. But you should stay on top of your health and see your doctor often to have follow-up tests. Let them know if you have any unusual symptoms. While you’re in remission, your doctor may give you a low dose of a maintenance therapy drug, such as a steroid or targeted medicine, for an extended period of time. This could keep you in remission longer and ward off a relapse. Although there’s no cure for multiple myeloma, it’s important to know that you can live with it for some time. New treatment options are also in development that may offer a better outlook in the future."
18,Measles,"What Is Measles? Measles is an infection you get from a virus. The measles virus lives in the mucus of the nose and throat. It’s spread through the air and by coming into direct contact with someone who has it. The virus can stay active on surfaces and in the air for up to 2 hours. It’s very contagious. If you haven’t been vaccinated and are in a room with someone who has measles , you have a 90% chance of getting it. Part of what makes measles so dangerous is that you can be contagious 4 days before you get the telltale rash . So you could easily spread the virus without knowing you have it. You’ll continue to be contagious 4 days after the rash goes away. Measles Symptoms Measles. Measles is an extremely contagious illness caused by a virus that replicates in the nose and throat of those infected. Although typically considered a childhood disease, anyone who is not vaccinated can get it. Symptoms such as a red itchy rash, fever, cough and runny nose usually begin appearing a week after exposure and progress in stages over a period of 2-3 weeks. It’s possible for you to be contagious to others for several days before you know you are sick and remain contagious even after the rash disappears. Measles usually happens in stages over a period of about 2-3 weeks. For the first 10-14 days after you come into contact with the virus, you won’t have any signs. This is the incubation period. A high fever is normally the first sign of infection after the incubation period is over. The fever will last 4 to 7 days. During that time, you might have the following symptoms: Runny nose Red eyes Sore throat Tiny white bumps in your mouth (doctors call these Koplik spots) A fter these symptoms, a red bumpy rash shows up. It usually starts at the hairline and spreads to the neck, torso, limbs, feet, and hands. As it spreads, your fever may spike as high as 105 F or higher. Finally, the rash starts to fade from the top of your body downward, starting with your face. You’re contagious to other people for 8 days: the 4 days before and after your rash shows up. Measles Causes and Risk Factors Measles is a highly contagious disease that is easily recognized by its red, itchy rash that can over the entire body. Despite the rash, measles is actually a respiratory disease which effects your breathing. It causes coughing, sneezing, high fevers, and possibly pneumonia. The infection can be deadly. Up to 90% of those who are not immune will also become infected when near someone with measles who is contagious, so it is important to get the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine. The symptoms appear 7 to 14 days after contact with the virus with the rash appearing 3 to 5 days after the first symptoms. Measles spreads quickly and easily. You can get it from being close to someone who has it. It travels through coughs and sneezes. You’ll also get it if you come in contact with any other nose or mouth fluids from someone who has it. The virus can stay on surfaces for up to 2 hours. You can pick it up by touching the surface and then rubbing your nose or eyes or touching your mouth. Your risk of getting measles goes up if you: Aren’t vaccinated, especially if you’re young or pregnant Have traveled outside the country Live in an area where many people are unvaccinated Are low in vitamin A Have an immunodeficiency due to another condition or medical treatment Measles Diagnosis To figure out whether you have measles, your doctor will first look closely at your rash. They’ll also look for the small white Koplik spots inside your mouth. Sometimes, to confirm it, they can also do a blood test. Measles Treatment and Home Remedies If you do get the measles virus, medicine won’t cure it (most drugs don’t kill viruses). The best way to speed up your recovery and prevent complications is to drink plenty of fluids and get lots of rest. There’s no specific treatment for measles, but there are things you can do if you think you’ve come into contact with it. Post-exposure vaccination. If you’ve never had a measles vaccination, you can get one up to 72 hours after being around the virus. The vaccine can lower your chances of getting it and can make your symptoms milder if you do. Immune serum globulin. This protein injection can boost your immune system if you’re pregnant, very young, or have a condition that makes it weak. You have to get it within 6 days of exposure to the virus. The injection may either prevent measles or keep your measles symptoms from being severe. If your measles causes a bacterial infection, such as an ear infection or pneumonia, your doctor may prescribe an antibiotic to help treat it. At home, you can help ease your measles symptoms with: Fever-reducing NSAIDs such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or naproxen. Don’t give children aspirin Vitamin A. Kids with low levels of vitamin A are at higher risk of measles. Boosting it can make measles symptoms less severe. Rest Plenty of fluids to hydrate yourself after fever and sweats A humidifier for easier breathing Dim lights or sunglasses to relieve eye pain caused by bright lights Measles Complications In the U.S., about 1 in 4 people who get measles end up in the hospital. Children under age 5 and adults over age 20 tend to have the worst problems. These may include: Ear infections . This is a very common complication caused by bacteria. Sometimes these ear infections cause permanent hearing loss. B ronchitis, laryngitis, or croup. Often, the measles virus causes inflammation in your voice box or bronchial tubes, the air passageways to your lungs. Diarrhea. Less than 1 out of every 10 people with measles gets diarrhea. Pneumonia. You can get a severe infection of your lungs. Encephalitis , a brain infection that can cause deafness and brain damage. About 1 in 1,000 people with measles gets it. You might get it right away or months after your infection. Pregnancy problems such as low birth weight, premature birth, or even death of the mother Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a very rare complication some people get 7-10 years after having measles. SSPE affects your central nervous system and is fatal. Measles Prevention If you get measles, you’ll be sick for a couple of weeks. Fortunately, it’s preventable. Immunizations are by far the best way to prevent the spread of measles. Thanks to the measles- mumps - rubella (MMR) vaccine , the virus has been mostly wiped out in the United States. That doesn't mean no one gets measles anymore; it’s just not constantly around. If you live in the U.S. and do get it, it's usually because someone brought it in from another country. The MMR vaccine is 97% effective after two doses. Doctors recommend that children get the first dose when they're between 12 and 15 months old, and the second between 4 and 6 years old. The vaccine is safe for most people.  But p regnant women, people with weakened immune systems (from diseases like leukemia and tuberculosis ), and those with certain allergies can’t get the vaccine. As a result, the odds are higher that they’ll get the virus if they are exposed to it. Side effects from the MMR shot aren’t common, but you may have: A sore, red, or swollen spot where you got the shot Fever Mild rash Temporary pain or stiffness in your joints Very rarely, the MMR shot can cause a high fever or seizures. The MMR vaccine doesn't cause autism. Researchers have done many studies on the MMR shot and autism. None of them show any link between the two. Some people should not get the MMR vaccine. You may need to skip it if you have: Allergies to any of the ingredients A condition that weakens your immune system A family history of immune system problems A condition that makes you bruise or bleed easily Tuberculosis Had another vaccine in the past 4 weeks Any kind of illness that’s making you feel run down You may need to delay your MMR vaccine if you’re pregnant, think you might be pregnant, or have recently had a blood transfusion. If you can’t get a MMR shot, it’s important to take safety measures to ward off infection. Make sure you: Wash your hands well and often with soap. Bandage any cuts or broken skin. Keep your hands away from your face. Don’t share utensils, napkins, or tissues with other people."
19,Health Insurance: 5 Tips for Emergency Room Visits,"If you're at the emergency room (ER), you are probably there because you're dealing with a serious medical problem. While you are there, you will have to answer questions about your medical history and your health insurance. You might have to make important decisions about tests and procedures, too. Being prepared may help you avoid huge medical bills. Here are five tips to get better and more affordable care during a medical emergency. 1. Don't Assume the ER Is the Right Place for You You might avoid a long wait and save a lot of money by going to an urgent care center instead of the ER. These centers can handle many illnesses and injuries that used to be treated only at an ER, such as: Burns Minor broken bones Cuts that require stitches Save the ER for life-threatening conditions like seizures , serious head injuries , and severe pain, such as pain that could point to a heart attack or stroke, or concerning abdominal issues (ex: appendicitis). A few tips:  Many urgent care centers take insurance coverage. Ask if your plan is accepted. If you are taking your child to an ER or urgent care clinic, try to use a pediatric center or one where there are pediatricians on staff. 2. Be Ready to Answer Questions About Your Health Whether at an urgent care center or the ER, the doctor treating you will need good information to give you the best care. If possible, be ready to provide your medical history when you arrive at the ER, including: A list of all daily/regular or new medications or antibiotics or supplements you're taking, have been recently prescribed, or recently completed Any allergies you have, especially to medications A list of previous stays at the hospital (especially ICU admissions)and diagnoses you have received Information on any past surgeries A list of past or chronic illnesses Health problems that run in your family Vaccines you've received Any specialists (including their names) you may be seeing It's a good idea to store all this information on your cell phone using a medical records app. Or if you prefer, write down your medical information and keep it in a place where you can grab it quickly. That way, you won't have to try to remember all of it when you're sick or hurt. 3. Know Your ER Rights The Affordable Care Act requires insurance companies to cover care you receive in the ER if you have an emergency medical condition. You don't need to get approval ahead of time, and it doesn't matter whether the hospital or facility is in or outside of your insurance network. But the key words are ""emergency medical condition."" That means your symptoms are bad enough for you to think your health will be in danger if you don't get care right away. If you have time, try to check with your usual doctor first. 4. Could My Doctor Do This Test Later? You may need a lot of tests or imaging while you are in the ER to figure out what's causing your health problem. This is especially true when you have a medical emergency. But tests and imaging done in a hospital can cost a lot more than they would if done elsewhere. If you are able, ask your ER doctor if there's any risk in putting off tests and scans until you can see your primary care doctor, who might decide you don't need them. If you do need the tests but it's not an emergency, they'll likely cost less in a doctor's office than they will at the ER. 5. Check ER Bills Carefully You should be charged in-network rates for most of the care you get at the ER. During your stay, though, you might be treated by someone outside your network. This could be the ER doctor, a technician, or a specialist. Those providers can bill you directly for the difference between what they charge and what your health plan pays. Most plans will cover all ER fees when you're treated for a true emergency. But you may have to submit them yourself to your insurance company. Check all your ER bills and insurance reports carefully."
20,How to Save Money on Prescription Drugs,"About half of Americans take at least one prescription drug. If you're one of them, you've probably noticed that prescription medications can be quite expensive, and costs are rising. You've got resources to help you save money while still putting your health first. For starters, your doctor and pharmacist can be extremely helpful -- if you ask. But if you don't speak up, they'll never know. Go Generic These medications have the same active ingredients as brand-name drugs, but often at a much lower cost. ""It's the first place to start,"" says Reid Rasmussen, a consumer health expert with 25 years of health care insurance and administration experience. ""It's possible that the non-generic works better for you, but by all means start with the generic, always."" The process is easy: If your medication is available as a generic, the pharmacist will automatically give you that version. ""In general, generics are cheaper, but there are some exceptions to the rule,"" says John Meigs, MD, spokesman for the American Academy of Family Physicians. If a generic is too expensive, it's worth asking your doctor about other treatment options. Get the Most Out of Your Insurance You pay for health insurance, so take advantage of it. Each insurance company has a list of drugs that they do and don't cover, called a formulary. But don't bother trying to make sense of it, Rassmussen says. It's much easier to simply call your insurance company and ask about the drugs you take. And if you get to the pharmacy and find out a drug is too expensive or isn't covered, he recommends you pick up the phone. Say something like, ""I went to fill this and my pharmacist said it's not covered. Is there an alternative?"" There might be a similar medication that your plan will pay for. You could try getting a higher dose and splitting it in half, suggests Mohamed Jalloh, PharmD, a spokesman for the American Pharmacists Association. ""Some insurance companies charge based upon the quantity of medications,"" he says, ""so by doubling the strength of a medication and cutting it in half, you may only be charged for 15 whole tablets instead of 30 whole tablets."" (Run the idea past your doctor or pharmacist first, since some pills shouldn't be split.) Ask for Help ""A lot of times, we [doctors] don't know how much medicines cost,"" Meigs says. ""Let your doctor know if you're having trouble paying for medications. He or she can look at alternative medications that might be less expensive."" Check with your pharmacist about special programs or discount cards . ""Some pharmacies offer plans where people can get 30-day prescriptions of certain medications for as low as $4. In some cases, patients may even get them for free,"" Jalloh says. Pharmacists will also know if drug companies are running promotions. They might also be able to give you coupons for certain drugs or manufacturers. These are things that your doctor wouldn't have known, but your pharmacist will. You might be able to save $50 or so, Rasmussen says. Comparison Shopping The price of a medication can vary widely from one pharmacy to another, too. Technology can make it easier to shop around. ""Apps like GoodRx help to clarify the prices of medications at various pharmacies. This allows you to identify which pharmacy would give you the best deal for all of your medications,"" Jalloh says. When you shop online and get your prescription by mail, make sure you're buying from a legitimate and licensed source. Look for one that: Has a Verified Internet Pharmacy Practice Site (VIPPS) seal from the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy or a "".pharmacy"" address Is registered with the Canadian International Pharmacy Association, www.cipa.com Has high ratings and good reviews at pharmacychecker.com The price at a pharmacy outside of the U.S. may seem like a huge discount, but a great deal isn't one if you aren't really getting the drug you need. At some websites, you can pay a monthly fee in exchange for discounts. But ""for the most part, these companies are charging you $29 per month to get you free programs,"" Rasmussen says. Talk to your pharmacist about prescription savings programs instead. Patient Assistance Programs Most drug companies offer patient assistance programs. These help you get free or reduced-cost medications. You'll have to qualify for the program, and each manufacturer has different standards. Send a note to the company through their website. Or ask your pharmacist for help reaching out to the right place. Don't Skip Doses This may seem like an obvious no-no, but it's more common than you might think. More than 12% of U.S. adults have skipped taking medication or simply not filled a prescription to save money, according to a government survey. ""A lot of times if the patient can't afford [a medication], they don't take it,"" Meigs says. ""Or they may only take it half of the time. That obviously complicates their care."" It makes the drug less effective, which is a waste of money and can lead to serious health problems -- and even bigger bills -- later."
21,What Is Babesiosis?,"Babesiosis is a rare and life-threatening infection of the red blood cells that's usually spread by ticks . It's caused by tiny parasites called Babesia. The kind that most often affects humans is called Babesia microti . They enter your bloodstream when you're bitten by an infected deer tick. Other ways babesiosis can spread include: Contaminated blood transfusions A pregnant , infected mother passing it to their baby in the womb or during birth Babesiosis usually happens in the warmer months. Ticks carrying the parasite have been found in: Block Island, R.I. Fire Island, Shelter Island, and eastern Long Island, N.Y. Martha's Vineyard, Mass. Nantucket, Mass. Coastal areas of New Jersey People have gotten this infection in other states, too, including: California Connecticut Delaware Maine Minnesota Wisconsin It's also been seen in Europe. Symptoms Signs of babesiosis start 1 to 8 weeks after you come in contact with the parasite that causes the disease. Sometimes you won't notice any symptoms. If you do, they might include: Body aches Chills Fatigue Fever Headache Loss of appetite Sweating You also can get a condition called hemolytic anemia in which your red blood cells die faster than your body can make new ones. Symptoms of this can include: Confusion Dark-colored urine Dizziness Heart murmur Rapid heart rate Swelling of your spleen and liver Very pale skin Weakness Yellow skin, eyes , and mouth ( jaundice ) Symptoms can be worse if you're elderly, no longer have your spleen, or have a health condition or take medications that weaken your immune system . If you notice any of these symptoms, see your doctor and be sure to tell them if you've traveled recently. Ticks can be the size of a poppy seed, so you may not know if you've been bitten by one. Diagnosis Your doctor will order blood tests to check for signs of infection. This includes looking for Babesia in the blood under a microscope. They may also want to do other blood tests to rule out conditions with similar symptoms, such as anaplasmosis or Lyme disease , which is also caused by ticks. It's possible to have Lyme disease at the same time as babesiosis. Treatment and Prevention If you don't have any symptoms, you probably won't need treatment. If you do, your doctor may prescribe a drug called atovaquone that kills microorganisms along with the antibiotic azithromycin .  Another combination they may recommend is quinine with the antibiotic clindamycin. The ticks that cause babesiosis typically have to stay on your body for 36 to 48 hours to cause an infection. Here are some ways to prevent one: Stay away from overgrown grasses and leaf piles, where ticks are likely to be. Wear long pants tucked into your socks and a long-sleeve shirt when you're near where ticks thrive. Wear light-colored clothes so you can easily spot ticks. Use bug repellant that has DEET in it on your skin and clothing. Before going indoors, check your clothing and pets for ticks. Once inside, check your entire body for ticks using a full-length or hand-held mirror. Remove any ticks with pointed tweezers."
22,What Is Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy Syndrome?,"Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome (RSD) is a disorder that causes lasting pain , usually in an arm or leg, and it shows up after an injury, stroke , or even heart attack . But the severity of pain is typically worse than the original injury itself. Doctors don’t know exactly what causes it, but they are able to treat many cases. The term reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome is actually not a name that doctors use anymore. It’s an older term used to describe one form of Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS). RSD is sometimes called Type I CRPS, and it’s caused by injury to tissue with no related nerve damage . What Causes RSD? Doctors think the pain caused by RSD comes from problems in your sympathetic nervous system. Your sympathetic nervous system controls blood flow movements that help regulate your heart rate and blood pressure . When you get hurt, your sympathetic nervous system tells your blood vessels to get smaller so you don’t lose too much blood at your injury site. Later, it tells them to open back up so blood can get to damaged tissue and repair it. When you have RSD, your sympathetic nervous system gets mixed signals. It turns on after an injury, but doesn’t turn back off. This causes a lot of pain and swelling at your injury site. Sometimes, you can get RSD even if you haven’t had an injury, although it’s not as common. RSD is a little more typical in women than in men. Children can get it, too, but usually it shows up between ages 30 and 60. Symptoms When you get RSD, your symptoms may show up slowly. You may have pain first, and then it may get worse over time. You may not realize your pain is abnormal at first. The types of injuries that can cause RSD include: Amputation Bruises Burns Cuts Fractures Minor surgery Needle sticks Radiation therapy Sprains It’s most common to get RSD in your arm, shoulder , leg, or hip. Usually the pain spreads beyond your injury site. In some cases, symptoms can spread to other parts of your body, too. RSD can also affect your immune system . This can cause: Redness Skin that’s warm to the touch around the injury Swelling The pain you get with RSD is usually constant and severe. Many people describe RSD pain as: Aching Burning Cold Deep Throbbing Your skin may also feel sensitive when you do things that don’t normally hurt it, like taking a shower. Or it might hurt just to wear your clothes. Other symptoms of RSD include: Changes in your hair or nail growth, or skin’s texture Excess sweat in certain areas of your body Muscle weakness or spasms Stiff joints Trouble moving the injured area White, mottled, red, or blue skin Diagnosis Often, doctors don’t know your pain is being caused by RSD until you’ve had it for some time. When pain doesn’t go away, or is more severe than it should be for your type of injury, it can be the first clue that it could be RSD. There’s no single test that can tell your doctor whether you have RSD. Instead, they’ll rely on a physical exam and your medical history information. There are also a few tests that can provide clues to see if you have certain signs of the condition. These include: Bone scan. This test can detect if any of your bones are wearing away at the ends or whether there are issues with regular blood flow. MRI . Your doctor might order an MRI to look inside your body, specifically at your tissues, for noticeable changes. Sweat test. This test can tell your doctor if you sweat more on one side of your body than the other. Thermography test. This sympathetic nervous system test checks to see if the temperature or blood flow is different at your injury site than in other parts of your body. X-rays. These are typically ordered if your syndrome is in later stages to look for mineral loss in your bones. Treatment Early detection is key in RSD treatment. The earlier you’re able to catch it, the better your treatment will work. Some cases of RSD don’t respond to treatment. RSD doesn’t have a cure, but it’s possible to recover from many of the symptoms. Some of the medications your doctor may suggest include: Anesthetic creams like lidocaine Antidepressants Anti-inflammatory drugs, called NSAIDs Anti- seizure medications that may help treat pain Nasal spray that treats bone loss Nerve blocking injections Over-the-counter options like aspirin , ibuprofen , or naproxen for pain Other treatments that are less frequently used because of their risk of side effects and the lack of evidence that they work as well include: Corticosteroids like methylprednisolone ( Medrol ) or prednisolone (AsmalPred Plus ) to treat swelling Opioids , such as fentanyl ( Duragesic ), hydrocodone ( Hysingla ER , Zohydro ER ), morphine ( Arymo ER , Kadian , Morphabond , MS Contin ), and oxycodone Other ways to treat symptoms include: Electrodes on your spinal cord that send small electric shocks to relieve pain Physical therapy to help you move around more easily and take away pain Psychotherapy that can teach you relaxation methods Splints to help with hand pain If your pain doesn’t seem to be going away, even after treatment, your doctor may suggest a surgery called a sympathectomy. During this procedure, a surgeon removes certain nerves around your blood vessels to help improve your blood flow."
23,Rare Types of Anemia,"Think of your red blood cells as the transport system that carries oxygen to your body’s tissues. When you have anemia , your body doesn’t make enough red blood cells , or these cells don’t work as well as they should. You end up feeling weak, tired , and short of breath. Anemia comes in many forms. Iron-deficiency anemia is most common. Other types of the disease affect only small numbers of people. Here’s a look at some of the rare types of anemia and how they’re treated. Aplastic (or Hypoplastic) Anemia Blood cells are made from stem cells in your bone marrow. When you have aplastic anemia , stem cells in your bone marrow are damaged and can’t make enough new blood cells. You’re either born with aplastic anemia, meaning you inherited a gene from your parents that caused it, or you develop it (acquired). Acquired aplastic anemia is the more common of the two, and sometimes it’s only temporary. Acquired causes include: Autoimmune diseases such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis Chemicals such as pesticides, arsenic, and benzene Infections including hepatitis , Epstein-Barr virus, and HIV Radiation and chemotherapy treatments for cancer Inherited conditions such as Fanconi anemia, Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, and Diamond-Blackfan anemia, can damage cells and also cause aplastic anemia. Symptoms of aplastic anemia can include everything from shortness of breath and dizziness to headaches , pale skin , chest pain , fast heart rate ( tachycardia ), and cold hands and feet . One way to treat aplastic anemia is with a blood transfusion . You’ll get a donor’s blood through a vein. A stem cell transplant can also treat aplastic anemia. It replaces the damaged stem cells in your bone marrow with healthy cells. Sideroblastic Anemia In this group of blood disorders , your body can't use iron to make hemoglobin -- the protein that carries oxygen in your blood. The iron buildup causes the formation of abnormal red blood cells called sideroblasts. There are two main types of sideroblastic anemia: Acquired sideroblastic anemia can be caused by exposure to certain chemicals or drugs . Hereditary sideroblastic anemia happens when a gene mutation disrupts normal hemoglobin production. This gene produces “heme,” the part of hemoglobin that carries oxygen. Symptoms for both types include: Chest pain Fast heartbeat, or tachycardia Headaches Trouble breathing Weakness and fatigue Treatment for sideroblastic anemia depends on the cause. If you have acquired anemia, you'll need to avoid the chemical or drug that caused it. Other treatments include vitamin B6 therapy and bone marrow or stem cell transplants. Myelodysplastic Syndromes Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are diseases that are caused when your bone marrow is damaged and can't make enough healthy blood cells. MDS is a type of cancer . Some people are born with a gene that causes MDS. These genes are usually passed down from one or both parents. If you have certain inherited syndromes, including Fanconi anemia, Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, Diamond Blackfan anemia, familial platelet disorder, and severe congenital neutropenia , you could be more likely to develop MDS. A small number of people also get MDS after radiation or chemotherapy treatment for cancer . Another risk is exposure to chemicals like benzene, which is found in tobacco smoke. Some people don’t have symptoms with MDS, but others do, including: Bruising or bleeding Infection Fever Shortness of breath Weakness and fatigue Weight loss Oncologists (cancer doctors) and hematologists (blood doctors) treat MDS with chemotherapy, hematopoietic growth factors, and stem cell or bone marrow transplants . Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia Autoimmune hemolytic anemia happens when your body's immune system attacks and destroys red blood cells faster than it can make new ones. If you have an autoimmune disease like lupus , you’re also more likely to get this type of anemia. Medicines such as methyldopa ( Aldomet ), penicillin , and quinine ( Qualaquin ) can also cause autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Symptoms include fatigue, pale skin, fast heartbeat (tachycardia), trouble breathing, chills, backache, and yellow skin ( jaundice ). Treating the disease that caused the anemia can also stop your red blood cell damage. If you have an autoimmune disease, your doctor might treat you with steroid drugs to calm your immune system , which can help the anemia. Congenital Dyserythropoietic Anemia (CDA) CDA is a group of inherited anemias that reduce the number of healthy red blood cells in the body. All CDAs are passed down through families. There are three types of CDA, types 1, 2, and 3. Type 2 is the most common and type 3 is the rarest. Symptoms include chronic anemia, fatigue, yellow skin and eyes (jaundice), pale skin, and missing fingers and toes at birth. Some people never need treatment. But depending on the severity of the disease, your doctor might recommend a blood transfusion, a stem cell transplant, or medicines to lower iron levels or interferon alfa-2A, a drug typically used for treating leukemia and melanoma . Diamond-Blackfan Anemia If you have Diamond-Blackfan anemia, your bone marrow doesn't make enough red blood cells. Doctors think it is caused by changes to your genes. Symptoms of Diamond-Blackfan anemia include: Fast heartbeat (tachycardia) Fatigue Heart murmur Irritability Pale skin Short height Sleepiness Weak bones Treatments include everything from steroids that can help produce more red blood cells to red blood cell transfusions and bone marrow transplants. Megaloblastic Anemia With this type of anemia, your bone marrow produces abnormally structured red blood cells that are too large and too young. Because they’re not mature or healthy, they can't carry oxygen throughout your body very well. Megaloblastic anemia is caused by too little vitamin B12 (cobalamin) or vitamin B9 (folate). Your body needs these vitamins to make red blood cells. Some people with megaloblastic anemia might not have symptoms for many years. But once symptoms do appear, they’re similar to other types of anemia, and include: Dizziness and fatigue Diarrhea , nausea Fast or irregular heartbeat (tachycardia) Muscle pain or weakness Pale skin Trouble breathing Doctors treat megaloblastic anemia with vitamin B9 and vitamin B12 supplements to replace what your body is missing. You'll also need treatment for any disease -- such as Crohn's -- that caused your body to lack these vitamins. Fanconi Anemia Fanconi anemia makes your blood marrow produce too few blood cells. It's hereditary, meaning it’s passed down from one of your parents through a gene mutation. Symptoms and physical traits of Fanconi anemia include: Abnormal thumbs Easy bruising and bleeding Fatigue Frequent infections Heart , kidney , and bone problems Skin color changes Small body, head, and eyes If you have Fanconi anemia, you’re more likely to get a type of cancer called acute myeloid leukemia , or AML. Your odds of getting cancers of the head, neck, skin, GI tract, or genitals also go up. Treatment depends on several factors, including what stage it’s in and the severity of physical complications. Treatments include hormone therapy and growth factors to boost blood cell growth. If symptoms become severe, your doctor might recommend a bone marrow stem cell transplant. Oftentimes a bone marrow transplant can cure the problems altogether."
24,Help When Epilepsy Treatment Doesn't Work,"What Is Refractory Epilepsy? If your doctor says you have refractory epilepsy, it means that medicine isn't bringing your seizures under control. You might hear the condition called by some other names, such as uncontrolled, intractable, or drug-resistant epilepsy. Your doctor can try certain things to help keep your seizures under better control. For instance, they might try different combinations of drugs or a special diet. Your doctor may also put a device under your skin that sends electrical signals to one of your nerves, called the vagus nerve. This may cut the number of seizures you get. A Neuropace device is a reactive neurostimulator that detects seizures and shocks the brain to stop them. Surgery that removes a part of the brain that causes your seizures may also be an option. With any of these treatments, you may still need to take epilepsy medicine throughout your life. It's natural to feel anxious when the doctor tells you your epilepsy isn't getting better with the medicine you're taking. You don't have to go through it alone, though. It's important to reach out to family and friends to get the emotional support you need. You might also want to join a support group, so you can talk with other people who are going through the same things you are. Causes Doctors don’t know why some people have refractory epilepsy and others don't. You can have refractory epilepsy as an adult, or your child might have it. About 1 in 3 people with epilepsy will develop it. Symptoms The symptoms of refractory epilepsy are seizures despite taking anti-seizure medication. Your seizures could take different forms and last from a few seconds to a few minutes. You may have convulsions, which means you can't stop your body from shaking. When you have a seizure, you may also: Black out Lose control of your bowels or bladder Stare into space Fall down suddenly Get stiff muscles Bite your tongue Getting a Diagnosis Your doctor has several ways to diagnose refractory epilepsy. They may ask you questions such as: How often do you have seizures? Do you ever skip doses of your medicine? Does epilepsy run in your family? Do you still have seizures after taking medicine? Your doctor may also give you a test called an electroencephalogram. To do this, they'll place metal discs called electrodes on your scalp that measure brain activity. Other tests might include a CT scan of your brain. It's a powerful X-ray that makes detailed pictures of the inside of your body. You might also need to get an MRI of your brain. It uses magnets and radio waves to make pictures of your brain. If you need surgery to treat refractory epilepsy, these tests can help doctors find out where your seizures are starting. Your doctor will most likely want you to report your symptoms regularly. They may try several drugs at different doses. Questions for Your Doctor What might be causing my seizures? Which tests are needed to diagnose refractory epilepsy? Should I see an epilepsy specialist? What treatments are available for refractory epilepsy? What precautions should I take to avoid getting injured during a seizure? Are there any limits on my activities? Treatment Medications. Your doctor may take a second look at the drugs you're taking. They may suggest another medicine, either alone or combined with other drugs, to see if it helps you have fewer seizures. Many drugs can treat epilepsy, including: Brivaracetam ( Briviact ) Cannabidiol ( Epidiolex ) Carbamazepine ( Carbatrol , Tegretol ) Cenobamate ( Xcopri ) Clobazam ( Sympazan ) Divalproex ( Depakote ) Dilantin ( Phenytek ) Eslicarbazepine ( Aptiom ) Felbamate ( Felbatol ) Gabapentin ( Neurontin ) Lamotrigine ( Lamictal ) Levetiracetam ( Keppra ) Oxcarbazepine ( Trileptal ) Perampanel ( Fycompa ) Potiga ( Ezogabine ) Primidone ( Mysoline ) Rufinamide ( Banzel ) Tiagabine ( Gabitri l) Topiramate ( Topamax ) Vigabatrin ( Sabril ) Zonisamide ( Zonegram ) Surgery. If you still have seizures after trying two or three anti-epilepsy drugs, your doctor might recommend brain surgery. It can help a lot if your epilepsy only affects one side of your brain. Doctors call that refractory partial epilepsy. A surgeon removes the area of your brain that's responsible for your seizures. It's natural to worry about brain surgery and to wonder if it will affect the way you think or if you'll seem like a different person afterward. Talk with your doctor about what to expect if you choose the surgery or if you don't, so you can weigh the risks and benefits. A lot of people who have the surgery say that getting free of seizures -- or at least making them less common and less intense -- makes them feel much better. The surgeon usually operates on an area of your head that's behind your hairline, so you won't have noticeable scars. After it's done, you'll probably need to stay in an intensive care unit of the hospital for a few days. After that, you'll move to a regular hospital room, where you may need to stay for up to 2 weeks. You should take it easy for a while after you get back home, but you'll probably be able to return to a normal routine in 1 to 3 months. Even with the surgery, you might need to take seizure medication for a few years. You might need to stay on the drugs for the rest of your life. Talk to your doctor about any side effects you might have from the surgery. You can ask them to put you in touch with other people who've had the surgery, so you can better understand what to expect. Diet. The ketogenic diet helps some people with epilepsy. It's a high-fat, low-protein, no carb diet. You have to start it in a specific way and follow it strictly, so you need a doctor's supervision. Your doctor will watch closely to see whether or when you can lower any of your medication levels. Because the diet is so specific, you may need to take vitamin or mineral supplements. Doctors aren't sure why the ketogenic diet works, but some studies show that children with epilepsy who stay on the diet have a better chance of reducing their seizures or their medications. For some people, a modified Atkins diet may work, too. It's slightly different from the ketogenic diet. You don't have to restrict calories, protein, or fluids. Also, you don't weigh or measure foods. Instead, you track carbohydrates. People with seizures that are hard to treat have also tried a low-glycemic-index diet. This diet focuses on the type of carbs, as well as the amount that someone eats. Electrical stimulation, also known as neuromodulation. This technology works directly on your nerves. It changes or controls nerve activity by sending electrical signals or medicine to a specific area. Methods include: Cortical stimulation. Temporary electrodes are placed on the surface of your brain. The doctor sends a signal through them at a level low enough that you won’t notice. If it helps, they can be replaced with permanent electrodes for continuous stimulation. Closed-loop stimulation. The doctor implants a device under your scalp and within your skull. It’s connected to two electrodes placed either on the surface of your brain, in the brain, or both. The electrodes record your brain waves. When the neurostimulator detects seizure-like activity, it sends a small electrical current to your brain that can stop, shorten, or maybe prevent the seizure. Deep brain stimulation. The doctor implants thin electrodes deep into certain areas of your brain and a pulse generator under your collarbone. Wires under your skin connect the two. The pulse generator sends signals to disrupt abnormal patterns of brain activity. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) . The doctor puts a device that looks like a heart pacemaker under your left collarbone. It connects to the vagus nerve in your neck through a wire that runs under your skin. The device sends a current to the nerve, which may cut down on the number of seizures you get or make them less intense. Clinical trials. You may want to ask your doctor if you could take part in a clinical trial. These trials test new drugs to see if they're safe and if they work. They're often a way for people to try new medicine that isn't yet available to everyone. Taking Care of Yourself Stress can sometimes trigger seizures. Talking to a counselor is a great way to find solutions to manage your stress. Try going to a support group, too. You can talk with people who know what you're going through and who give advice from their own experience. What to Expect Even though you have refractory epilepsy, it's still possible to get your seizures under control. It may be a matter of switching to a different treatment. Your doctor may find a different drug combination that helps. Getting electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve means fewer seizures for about 40% of people who try it. And if a brain surgeon can remove the part of the brain that's causing seizures, the seizures may stop, or at least happen less often and become less intense. Getting Support As you are finding out what works best, you'll need a strong network of family and friends who can offer emotional support, especially if your seizures prove hard to control. Having a trusted person to listen to you can be a great comfort when you're going through something tough. Ask your doctor for information on support groups in your area. You can also find out about support groups by going to the website of the Epilepsy Foundation."
25,Do I Need Physical Therapy for a Meniscus Tear?,"If you just found out that the pain and swelling in your knee is a torn meniscus , you probably have a decision to make about how to treat it. What’s best for you depends on what the tear’s like, your age, and how soon you want to get back to your normal activities. You have two menisci -- that’s the plural for meniscus -- in each knee . They’re made of cartilage , a tough, rubbery substance. They’re basically shock absorbers that keep your thighbone in the upper leg from pounding on the shinbone in the lower leg. If you tear one, your doctor probably will suggest that you rest, apply ice, and take pain relievers at first. From there, you might need physical therapy (PT), surgery, or both. Can I Do PT Instead of Surgery? PT is often part of what doctors call “conservative treatment” to avoid surgery, at least early on. People who are middle-aged or have osteoarthritis often tear the meniscus simply because it’s worn down. For them, PT may be as effective as surgery. Even if you’re younger, fit, and athletic, a conservative approach is often a good place to start. It can work well, depending on the direction of the tear, how long it is, and where it’s located. But if the tear causes your knee to lock up, you’ll likely need surgery. Part of your decision may be about how limited you are by the injury. If you’re an elite athlete or you can’t work because of it, you may not have time to see if a conservative approach works. Even if you have surgery, you’ll need PT afterward. Your doctor may send you to a physical therapist, but at the very least you’ll get PT exercises to do at home. This will help bring your knee back to full health. What Will It Be Like? Whether you do PT as part of a conservative treatment or to heal after surgery, the goal is the same -- to get back your range of motion, strength, and control. The PT process usually goes something like this: You start with exercises that focus on range of motion , like flexing and extending your knee as much as you can without pain. You move on to stretches that keep your leg muscles loose. You begin basic exercises , like straight leg raises and toe raises. If you can do all that without pain, you move onto more advanced exercises , like toe raises with weights, squats, and harder stretches. Those are the general stages, but they can blur into each other based on your needs and ability. For example, you may start stretches and basic exercises sooner rather than later. Keep in mind, this isn’t the time to tell yourself, “No pain, no gain.” Your focus is to heal, so you don’t want to start more advanced exercises until you can do the basic ones without hurting. How Long Will I Need to Do PT? It depends on your age, the type of tear, how you heal, and type of surgery, if you had it. As part of a conservative treatment, you’ll probably try PT for around 4 to 6 weeks, on a regular schedule. Also, you must regularly exercise at home the way you are taught. If it doesn’t work, then it may be time for surgery. If you have surgery to remove part of the meniscus, it may take 3 to 6 weeks before you get back to normal activities. If you have surgery to repair your meniscus, it may take more like 3 months."
26,The Benefits of Restorative Rehabilitation,"Restorative rehabilitation has many benefits if you have multiple sclerosis . Rehab can help keep you as active, able, safe, and engaged as you can be at your stage of MS. It’s especially important after a flare-up to get back as much ability as you can. Restorative rehabilitation doesn’t stop the progression of MS, but it can greatly improve your quality of life, says Rosalind Kalb, PhD, vice president of the professional resource center at the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. It can help you: Maintain general health Improve strength, flexibility, and balance Train for problems that may come down the road Help incorporate things like canes and walkers Learn new skills Boost your mental outlook MS is unpredictable and affects everyone differently. So it’s important to have a rehab program designed for you. A rehab team will look for and identify problems, set goals, and come up with treatments. “With MS, you always want to intervene as early as possible,” says Francois Bethoux, MD, at the Cleveland Clinic. He says good timing can really make a difference in your ability and quality of life. Restorative rehabilitation includes: Physical therapy Occupational therapy Speech/language pathology Cognitive therapy Counseling Physical Therapy MS causes muscle weakness, stiffness, numbness, and fatigue . Because these can make walking and exercise tough, people with MS are often inactive, which can make the symptoms worse. Physical therapy can bring about big improvements. Targeted exercise does the most good, says Herb Karpatkin, DSc. He’s a physical therapist who specializes in MS. “It’s not just exercise. It’s the right exercise for the right condition,” Karpatkin says. For example, if you have foot drop because of your MS, you need to do different exercises than someone who needs to work only on stamina walking. Your balance, endurance, strength, and flexibility can all get better with therapy. It can help even if you’re in a wheelchair. Because fatigue tends to be an issue, Karpatkin recommends you break up your exercise. For example, instead of 20 minutes of walking, walk for 5 minutes and rest, four times. You’re more likely to be heat sensitive if you have MS. Cooling garments can help. One study Karpatkin did showed a cooling vest allowed the same person to walk an average of an extra 100 feet during a 6-minute walk. It’s also important that you are assessed both when you’re tired and when you’re not. That way, your therapists get a true picture of what type of help will work best. Occupational Therapy This can help you maintain your everyday skills. Your therapist will see what challenges you. They can then: Help improve upper body strength and coordination Offer devices that can assist you, like a grab bar for your shower or special kitchen or cleaning tools Show you how to make your home and workplace more comfortable If you’ve lost some ability because of a flare-up, they can help you with skills like: Cooking Cleaning Dressing Bathing Going to the bathroom If needed, your occupational therapists can also: Teach you how to use a walker or cane Help you learn how to drive a car using hand controls Kalb says they can also help you figure out when you have the most energy and focus, so you can plan your day in a way that makes you the most productive. Cognitive Therapy This can offer strategies for trouble with attention, focus, memory, and problem solving that can happen with MS. About half of MS patients have some of these problems. To help you focus at work, for example, you might need to move your desk so it doesn’t face a busy hallway. To improve memory, you can learn tools to help your remember where you put things or keep you from forgetting things on your to-do-list. There are also computer exercises you can do to work your short-term memory, processing speed, and focus. Speech/Language Therapy A speech/language therapist can help if you’re having trouble speaking or swallowing. Less muscle control in the lips, tongue , soft palate, vocal cords, and diaphragm can cause problems with speaking and swallowing. As many as 40% of people with MS have speech problems. A speech/language therapist can teach you exercises to help you relax and improve breath support. You also may need something to amplify your voice or a computer-assisted communications device. Counseling This is an important part of restorative therapy, not only for someone with MS, but for their family members, too. Many times finding an MS Support Group in your area can serve as a terrific support system. Contact the National MS Society to find a local chapter. “There’s a huge emotional component,” Kalb says. “Counseling really helps with the feeling of loss and the fear of change.” If you have MS, restorative rehab is an important way you can stay as active and productive as you can be. Talk with your medical team to learn what can help you."
27,Rh Factor,"What Is Rh Factor? The Rh factor is a type of protein that's usually found on red blood cells . When you have this protein, you’re considered Rh positive. About 85% of people are Rh-positive. The rest are Rh-negative. That means they don't have the protein. You get the protein from your parents at birth. Who Gets the Rh Factor Test? Every pregnant woman gets the Rh factor test during each pregnancy. It's one of the first and most important tests you'll have. You usually get it in the first trimester unless you have vaginal bleeding. How many other tests you get depend on the results: Rh positive: You won’t need another test. Rh negative: You may get a test called an antibody screen to see if your blood has Rh antibodies. If you’re Rh negative and your baby is Rh positive, you might be likely to have a condition called RH factor incompatibility, which could be dangerous. Rh Factor Incompatibility Most of the time, being Rh-negative has no risks. But during pregnancy, being Rh-negative can be a problem if your baby is Rh-positive. If your blood and your baby's blood mix, your body will start to make antibodies that can damage your baby's red blood cells . This is known as Rh sensitization. Rh sensitization is unlikely to harm the first Rh-positive baby that you carry, because you’ll rarely come into contact with your baby ’s blood until labor and delivery , meaning the antibodies won’t be created until after birth. But once you are Rh sensitized, the Rh antibodies stay in your system. If you get pregnant with another Rh-positive baby, your Rh antibodies will attack this baby’s blood while they’re growing inside you. This can cause Rh disease in your baby. Rh disease causes hemolytic anemia , which destroys red blood cells faster than the body can create them. It can cause serious illness or even death for your baby. Even though you and your baby don’t share blood, some of your blood can mix for various reasons. Most of the time, it happens during labor and delivery, but it can also happen: During amniocentesis, a test that uses a needle to take cells from the fluid that surrounds your baby inside the womb During chorionic villus sampling (CVS), a test that uses a long needle to take cells from the placenta (tissue within your womb that you use to nourish your baby) If you have vaginal bleeding when you’re pregnant If you have an injury to your belly while you’re pregnant If your baby is breech (feet-first) and your doctor tries to turn them around by pressing on your belly If you have a miscarriage , an ectopic pregnancy (a life-threatening problem that happens when a baby starts to grow outside the womb), or an abortion If you’re Rh-negative and your baby is Rh-positive, this means that your baby inherited the Rh gene from their Rh-positive dad. How the Rh Factor Test Is Done The Rh factor test is a simple blood test. It won’t harm you or your baby. The doctor will use a needle to take a small amount of blood from your arm. Rh Factor Test Results If you’re Rh-negative and your baby is Rh-positive, try not to worry. At around 28 weeks, the doctor will give you a shot of Rh immunoglobulin (RhIG). This drug stops your body from making antibodies for the rest of your pregnancy. You may need a dose after delivery, too. If you get pregnant again later, you’ll need more shots of RhIG. Let the doctor know if you have any spotting during pregnancy, especially if you’re Rh-negative. If you do, they may give you a shot of Rh immunoglobulin. If you already have Rh antibodies, the drug won't work. Instead, your doctor will keep a close watch on your baby's health . Some babies need a blood transfusion after delivery. Others need one while they’re still in the womb."
28,Understanding Rheumatic Fever,"What Is Rheumatic Fever? Rheumatic fever is a serious illness that can be life-threatening if left untreated. It happens when strep throat , caused by a bacteria called group A streptococcus, isn't treated properly. Symptoms usually start a few weeks after having strep throat and can include fever, muscle aches, swollen and painful joints, and sometimes a red rash. Sometimes, though, the infection may have been too mild for you to spot. The joints that are most commonly affected are the knees, ankles, elbows, and wrists. The pain can move from one joint to another. But the greatest danger from the disease is the damage it can do to the heart. More than half of the time, it damages the heart valves, making the heart work harder to pump blood. Over time, this damage can lead to a serious condition called rheumatic heart disease, which can eventually cause heart failure. Rheumatic fever can also cause a temporary nervous system disorder called Sydenham's chorea, previously known as St. Vitus' dance. This disorder causes rapid, jerky movements of the body, usually on one side. It can make it hard to focus or write for people with mild cases, while more severe cases can cause uncontrollable twitching in the arms, legs, or face, along with muscle weakness and emotional outbursts. Thanks to antibiotics , rheumatic fever is now rare in developed countries. However, there has been a recent increase in cases in the U.S., especially among children in poor urban areas. The illness tends to happen more often in cool, damp weather during winter and early spring and is most common in the northern states of the U.S. Scarlet fever vs. rheumatic fever Scarlet fever is a highly contagious and typically mild bacterial disease that causes fever, sore throat, and a rash. The illness is connected to rheumatic fever in a couple of ways. Both stem from the group A streptococcus bacteria. One cause of rheumatic fever is untreated scarlet fever. While you can spread scarlet fever, rheumatic fever is not contagious. Rheumatic Fever Causes Rheumatic fever happens when your body reacts to certain group A streptococcus bacteria. Instead of just fighting off the bacteria, your body's antibodies mistakenly attack your own tissues. This starts with the joints and can then affect the heart and nearby tissues. A very small number of people who have strep throat, less than 0.3%, end up getting rheumatic fever. Experts believe there are other factors involved too, like having a weak immune system. You can also get rheumatic fever if you don't treat a scarlet fever infection. How often does strep throat cause rheumatic fever? About 0.3%-3% of people with a strep throat infection develop rheumatic fever, even without treatment. Is rheumatic fever contagious? No. Since it's an immune response and not an infection, you can't catch this illness from another person. But if you have the group A strep or scarlet fever infection, you can pass it on to others. Rheumatic Fever Symptoms Swollen, tender, red, and extremely painful joints -- especially the knees, ankles, elbows, or wrists Fever A red, raised, lattice-like rash, usually on the chest, back, and abdomen Nodules, or small bumps, over the swollen joints Chest pain, fast heartbeat, or shortness of breath (caused by heart involvement) Jerky movements of arms, legs, or facial muscles that you can't control (called chorea) These symptoms can show up 1-5 weeks after a strep throat or scarlet fever infection where these infections were not treated properly. But sometimes, people with rheumatic fever do not recall having a sore throat. Monitor a sore throat Pay attention to sore throats, especially in children. If your child has a severe sore throat without other cold symptoms , accompanied by a fever higher than 100.4 F, or a milder sore throat that continues for more than 2 or 3 days, see a doctor. It may be strep throat, which should be treated with antibiotics . When to Call Your Doctor Call your doctor about rheumatic fever if you have: Symptoms of rheumatic fever, especially a recent sore throat. A sore throat without other cold symptoms, plus a fever higher than 101 F and swollen glands in your neck. Sudden and unexplained joint pain after recovering from strep throat. Rheumatic Fever Risk Factors Rheumatic fever can affect anyone who's had strep throat, scarlet fever, or impetigo. But some people are more likely to get the illness, including: Kids aged 5-15 years People in large groups such as schools, day-care centers, and military training facilities People who've had rheumatic fever in the past and get strep throat, scarlet fever, or impetigo again Rheumatic Fever Diagnosis To figure out if you have the streptococcus bacteria, your doctor will do a throat culture. This uncomfortable but safe procedure involves swabbing a sample of throat mucus. Your doctor will send it to the lab for analysis, which usually takes 24 hours. Some doctors use a rapid strep test that can give results in about 5 minutes, but it isn't as accurate as the culture. Your doctor will also give you a complete exam, which includes listening to your heart for any signs of trouble, such as a heart ""murmur"" (indicating potential valve issues). They will also look for other telltale symptoms, such as arthritis in more than one joint and small nodules that often appear on the joints, especially the elbows. Other tests to diagnose rheumatic fever include: A blood test that checks for antibodies related to a recent group A strep infection Electrocardiogram or EKG to find out how well your heart is working Echocardiography or echo, which shows your heart muscle in action Rheumatic Fever Treatment Your doctor will prescribe standard treatments that can lower your chances of heart disease and other health issues related to rheumatic fever. You'll probably use these treatments for a long time. Alternative therapies can also help by working alongside regular treatments to ease symptoms and help stop the illness from coming back. You'll need plenty of rest, and your doctor may have you take penicillin or other antibiotics to kill the bacteria that caused the fever. To stop it from coming back, you may need to take antibiotics for a long time. And, if you have a fever, swelling, arthritic joint pain , or other symptoms, your doctor can prescribe aspirin or other medicines that ease swelling, such as ibuprofen or naproxen . They may also give you corticosteroids. If you have rheumatic heart disease, you'll need to take antibiotics at certain times, like before getting dental work or surgery, to stop your heart valve from swelling up again. In severe cases, surgery can fix the damage to your heart valves and stop heart failure from happening. Rheumatic Fever Complications Weeks or even months after having rheumatic fever, you may still have joint and tissue swelling. This swelling could cause long-term health problems in some people. Another health issue, rheumatic heart disease, usually crops up years after your original illness, but heart valve damage can happen even when you still have symptoms. Other types of heart damage from rheumatic fever include: Valve stenosis, or a narrowing of the heart valve, which limits blood flow through the valve Valve regurgitation, which is when blood flows backward across a heart valve due to an improperly closing valve flap Heart muscle damage caused by swelling from rheumatic fever, which affects how well your heart pumps Irregular heartbeat, known as atrial fibrillation (AFib), which is caused by damage to the heart valves and other parts of your heart Takeaways Rheumatic fever is a rare but serious bacterial illness that can result from untreated strep throat or scarlet fever. You'll usually get symptoms 2-4 weeks after a strep infection. Though rare in developed countries, the illness has resurfaced in the U.S. Other health problems from the disease, such as heart damage, can show up years after you were first sick. Treatments include antibiotics and medicine to lower swelling, while people with severe cases may need surgery to repair heart damage."
29,Henoch-Schonlein Purpura (HSP),"Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP) is a disease involving inflammation of small blood vessels. It most commonly occurs in children. The inflammation causes blood vessels in the skin , intestines , kidneys , and joints to start leaking. The main symptom is a rash with numerous small bruises , which have a raised appearance, over the legs or buttocks. Henoch-Schonlein purpura. Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP) is a disease that involves inflammation which causes blood vessels in the skin, intestines, kidneys, and joints to start leaking. The main symptom is a rash with numerous small bruises, which have a raised appearance, over the legs or buttocks. Other symptoms can include joint and abdominal pain as well as kidney impairment. HSP most commonly occurs in children and in boys more than girls. Adults who develop it generally experience more severe cases. Although HSP can affect people at any age, most cases occur in children between the ages of 2 and 11. It is more common in boys than girls. Adults with HSP are more likely to have more severe disease compared to children. HSP usually ends after four to six weeks -- sometimes with recurrence of symptoms over this period, but with no long-term consequences (recurrences are fairly common). If organs such as the kidneys and intestines are affected, treatment is often needed and it is important to have regular follow-up to prevent serious complications. Causes and Risk Factors for Henoch-Schonlein Purpura The exact cause of HSP is not known. The body's immune system is believed to play a role in targeting the blood vessels involved. An abnormal immune response to an infection may be a factor in many cases. Approximately two-thirds of the cases of HSP occur days after symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection develop. Some cases of HSP have been linked to vaccinations for typhoid, cholera , yellow fever , measles , or hepatitis B; foods, drugs, chemicals, and insect bites. Some experts also say that HSP is associated with the colder weather of fall and winter. Symptoms of Henoch-Schonlein Purpura The classic symptoms of HSP are rash , joint pain and swelling, abdominal pain , and/or related kidney disease , including blood in urine. Before these symptoms begin, patients may have two to three weeks of fever, headache, and muscular aches and pains. Rarely, other organs, such as the brain , lungs , or spinal cord may be affected. Here are some key details about the symptoms of HSP: Rash. The rash usually appears in all patients with HSP. The initial appearance may resemble hives , with small red spots or bumps on the lower legs, buttocks, knees , and elbows. But these change to appear more like bruises . The rash usually affects both sides of the body equally and does not turn pale on pressing. Arthritis . Joint inflammation, involving pain and swelling, occurs in approximately three-quarters of cases, particularly affecting the knees and ankles . It usually lasts only a few days and does not cause any long-term, chronic joint problems. Abdominal pain. In more than half of people with HSP, inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract may cause pain or cramping; it may also lead to loss of appetite, vomiting , diarrhea , and occasionally blood in the stool. In some cases, patients may have abdominal pain before the rash appears. In rare cases, an abnormal folding of the bowel (intussusception) may cause a bowel blockage, which may require surgery to fix. Kidney impairment. HSP can cause kidney problems, indicated by such signs as protein or blood in the urine . This is usually only discovered on urine testing, since it does not generally cause any discomfort. In most patients, the kidney impairment is mild and goes away without any long-term damage. It's important to monitor the kidney problems closely and make sure they clear up, since about 5% of patients may develop progressive kidney disease. About 1% may go on to develop total kidney failure. Henoch-Schonlein Purpura Diagnosis and Treatment The diagnosis of HSP may be clear when the typical rash, arthritis , and abdominal pain are present. A doctor may order some tests to rule out other diagnoses, confirm the diagnosis, and assess its severity. Occasionally, when the diagnosis is uncertain, particularly if the only symptom is the classic rash, your doctor may perform biopsies of the skin or kidney. Urine and blood tests will likely be done to detect signs of kidney involvement and may need to be repeated during follow-up to monitor any changes in kidney function. Although there is no specific treatment for HSP, you can use over-the-counter pain medicines, such as acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ), such as ibuprofen and naproxen for joint pain. In some cases, corticosteroid medication may be used. The rash and joint pain will usually go away after four to six weeks without causing any permanent damage. Bouts of the rash may recur in approximately one-third of cases, but usually they are  milder, do not involve joint and abdominal symptoms, and they clear up on their own."
30,What Is the RICE Method for Injuries?,"If you’ve ever hurt your ankle or had another type of sprain or strain, chances are your doctor recommended rest, ice, compression, and elevation (RICE) as one of your first treatments. The RICE method is a simple self-care technique that helps reduce swelling, ease pain, and speed up healing. You can treat minor injuries with the RICE method at home. You might try it if you have an achy knee, ankle, or wrist after playing sports. If you have pain or swelling that gets worse or doesn’t go away, see a doctor. The RICE method includes the following four steps: Step 1: Rest Pain is your body’s signal that something is wrong. As soon as you’re hurt, stop your activity, and rest as much as possible for the first 2 days. Don’t try to follow the “no pain, no gain” philosophy. Doing so with certain injuries, like a moderate to severe ankle sprain , can make the damage worse and delay your recovery. Doctors say you should avoid putting weight on the injured area for 24 to 48 hours. Resting also helps prevent further bruising. Step 2: Ice Ice is a tried-and-true tool for reducing pain and swelling. Apply an ice pack (covered with a light, absorbent towel to help prevent frostbite ) for 15-20 minutes every two to three hours during the first 24 to 48 hours after your injury.  Don’t have an ice pack? A bag of frozen peas or corn will work just fine. Step 3: Compression This means wrapping the injured area to prevent swelling. Wrap the affected area with an elastic medical bandage (like an ACE bandage). You want it to be snug but not too tight -- if it’s too tight, it’ll interrupt blood flow. If the skin below the wrap turns blue or feels cold, numb, or tingly, loosen the bandage. If these symptoms don’t disappear right away, seek immediate medical help. Step 4: Elevation This means raising the sore body part above the level of your heart . Doing so reduces pain, throbbing, and swelling. It’s not as tricky to do as you might think. For example, if you have an ankle sprain, you can prop your leg up on pillows while sitting on the sofa. The CDC recommends you keep the injured area raised whenever possible, even when you’re not icing it. Treatments Used With RICE Your doctor may suggest using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (like ibuprofen or naproxen) along with the RICE treatment. These are available over the counter and by prescription. Talk to your doctor about your health history before taking these medications."
31,Vitamin D Deficiency,"If you shun the sun, wear sunscreen, suffer from milk allergies, or adhere to a strict vegan diet, you may be at risk for vitamin D deficiency. Known as the sunshine vitamin, vitamin D is produced by the body in response to skin being exposed to sunlight. It also occurs naturally in a few foods -- including some fish, fish liver oils, and egg yolks -- and in fortified dairy and grain products. Vitamin D is essential for strong bones because it helps the body use calcium from the diet. Traditionally, vitamin D deficiency has been associated with rickets, a disease in which the bone tissue doesn't properly mineralize, leading to soft bones and skeletal deformities. But increasingly, research is revealing the importance of vitamin D in protecting against a host of health problems. Symptoms and Health Risks of Vitamin D Deficiency Symptoms of bone pain and muscle weakness can mean you have a vitamin D deficiency. However, for many people, the symptoms are subtle. Yet, even without symptoms, too little vitamin D can pose health risks. Low blood levels of the vitamin have been associated with the following: Increased risk of death from cardiovascular disease Cognitive impairment in older adults Severe asthma in children Cancer Research suggests that vitamin D could play a role in the prevention and treatment of a number of different conditions, including type1 and type 2 diabetes, hypertension, glucose intolerance, and multiple sclerosis . Causes of Vitamin D Deficiency Vitamin D deficiency can occur for a number of reasons: You don't consume the recommended levels of the vitamin over time . This is likely if you follow a strict vegan diet, because most of the natural sources are animal-based, including fish and fish oils, egg yolks, fortified milk, and beef liver. Here are the best vitamin d foods for vegetarians. Your exposure to sunlight is limited. Because the body makes vitamin D when your skin is exposed to sunlight, you may be at risk of deficiency if you are homebound, live in northern latitudes, wear long robes or head coverings for religious reasons, or have an occupation that prevents sun exposure. During the winter, vitamin D deficiency can be more prevalent because there is less sunlight available. You have dark skin. The pigment melanin reduces the skin's ability to make vitamin D in response to sunlight exposure. Some studies show that older adults with darker skin are at high risk of vitamin D deficiency. Your kidneys cannot convert vitamin D to its active form. As people age, their kidneys are less able to convert vitamin D to its active form, thus increasing their risk of vitamin D deficiency. Your digestive tract cannot adequately absorb vitamin D. Certain medical problems, including Crohn's disease , cystic fibrosis, and celiac disease can affect your intestine's ability to absorb vitamin D from the food you eat. You are obese. Vitamin D is extracted from the blood by fat cells, altering its release into circulation. People with a body mass index of 30 or greater often have low blood levels of vitamin D. Tests for Vitamin D Deficiency The most accurate way to measure how much vitamin D is in your body is the 25-hydroxy vitamin D blood test. A level of 20 nanograms/milliliter to 50 ng/mL is considered adequate for healthy people. A level less than 12 ng/mL indicates vitamin D deficiency. Treatment for Vitamin D Deficiency Treatment for vitamin D deficiency involves getting more vitamin D -- through diet and supplements. Although there is no consensus on vitamin D levels required for optimal health -- and it likely differs depending on age and health conditions -- a concentration of less than 20 nanograms per milliliter is generally considered inadequate, requiring treatment. Guidelines from the Institute of Medicine increased the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) of vitamin D to 600 international units (IU) for everyone ages 1-70, and raised it to 800 IU for adults older than age 70 to optimize bone health. The safe upper limit was also raised to 4,000 IU. Doctors may prescribe more than 4,000 IU to correct a vitamin D deficiency. If you don't spend much time in the sun or always are careful to cover your skin ( sunscreen inhibits vitamin D production), you should speak to your doctor about taking a vitamin D supplement, particularly if you have risk factors for vitamin D deficiency."
32,What You Should Know About Ringworm,"What Is Ringworm? Ringworm isn’t a worm. It’s a skin infection that’s caused by mold like fungi that live on the dead tissues of your skin, hair , and nails. You can get it in any of these places -- and on your scalp. When you get it between your toes, it’s what people call athlete’s foot. If it spreads to your groin, it’s known as jock itch . What Are the Symptoms Of Ringworm? The telltale sign is a red, scaly patch on light skin or brown or gray patches on skin of color. You may also get bumps that itch. Over time, the bump turns into a ring- or circle-shaped patch. It may turn into several rings. The inside of the patch is usually clear or scaly. The outside might be slightly raised and bumpy. Ringworm on your scalp tends to start out as a bump or small sore. It may turn flaky and scaly, and your scalp may feel tender and sore to the touch. You may notice that your hair starts to fall out in patches. Ringworm will often look red on light skin, but brown or gray on skin of color. Most ringworm of the skin can be treated at home with creams you can buy without a prescription. Photo credit: iStock/Getty Images How Do You Get Ringworm? Ringworm is highly contagious. You can catch it in any of the following ways: From another person. Ringworm often spreads by skin-to-skin contact. From your pets . Rubbing or grooming Sparky? Wash your hands when you’re finished. It’s also very common in cows. By touching objects . The fungus that causes ringworm can linger on surfaces, clothes, towels, and in combs and brushes. From soil. If you’re working or standing barefoot in soil that’s infected with the fungus that causes ringworm, you can get it, too. How Do I Know If I Have Ringworm? You’ll have to see your doctor to be sure if the infection is ringworm. There are a number of other skin conditions that look like it. Your doctor will probably scrape some skin from the itchy, scaly areas and look at them under a microscope. What’s the Treatment For Ringworm? How the infection is treated depends on where it is and how bad it is. In many cases, your doctor may recommend an over-the-counter (OTC) medicine you can get at the drugstore. If the ringworm is on your skin, an OTC antifungal cream, lotion, or powder may work just fine. Some of the most popular ones are clotrimazole ( Lotrimin , Mycelex ) and miconazole . In most cases, you’ll have to use the medicines on your skin for 2 to 4 weeks to make sure you kill the fungus that causes ringworm. It also will lower its chance of coming back. If you have ringworm on your scalp or in many different places on your body, OTC treatments probably won’t be enough. Your doctor will have to write you a prescription. Keep an eye out for symptoms that get worse or don’t clear up after 2 weeks. If they don’t, call your doctor. How Can I Prevent Ringworm? The fungi that cause it are everywhere. Still, here are some things you can do to lower your chances of getting ringworm or stop it from spreading: Keep your skin clean and dry. Wear flip-flops in locker rooms and public showers. Change your socks and underwear at least once each day. Don’t share clothes or towels with someone who has ringworm. If you play sports, keep your gear and uniform clean -- and don’t share them with other players. Wash your hands with soap and water after playing with pets. If your pets have ringworm, see your vet."
33,What Is Retinopathy of Prematurity?,"The smaller and more pre-term a baby is at birth, the greater their chance of having retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), an eye disorder that can lead to vision loss . But most babies who are born with it get better over time. Many don't need treatment at all. ROP tends to affect premature babies who weigh less than 2 ¾ pounds and are born before the 31 st week of pregnancy . (A full-term pregnancy lasts 38-42 weeks.) In babies with ROP, abnormal blood vessels grow on the retina of each eye . The retina is the layer of tissue that lines the back of the eye and makes it possible to see. Over time, these blood vessels and the associated scar tissue can cause serious vision problems, such as: Damage to the retina and detachment (the retina is moved from its normal place) that leads to permanent and severe loss of vision Crossed eyes ( strabismus ) Increased eye pressure ( glaucoma ) "" Lazy eye "" ( amblyopia ) Nearsightedness ( myopia ) Of the 14,000 babies in the U.S. born with ROP each year, 400 to 600 will become legally blind . Symptoms Only an eye doctor can tell if your baby has ROP. All infants who are at risk for it should be screened shortly after birth and again once they go home from the hospital. Sometimes, ROP isn't spotted until a baby is 4 to 6 weeks old. Causes A baby's eyes begin to develop around the 16 th week of pregnancy. If they're born very early, this process is cut short. The blood vessels in their eyes don't have enough time to develop as they should. Instead, they grow where they're not supposed to. Or they can be so fragile that they bleed or leak. Diagnosis An eye doctor will put drops in your infant's eyes to make their pupils larger. This helps the doctor see all the parts of the eye better. It doesn't hurt. If your baby has ROP, the doctor will see where it is in the eye, how severe it is, and what the blood vessels in the eyes look like. Stage 1 is the mildest form of ROP. Babies at this stage or stage 2 often don't need any treatment and will have normal vision. Babies with stage 3 have more blood vessels that are abnormal. These may be large or twisted, which means the retina could start to come loose. At stage 4, the retina is starting to move from its normal place. And at stage 5, the retina has come off, and severe vision problems or even blindness is likely. Treatment For many babies, ROP often gets better on its own. But if it's severe and the risk of a detached retina is high, your child's ophthalmologist will want to start treatment. About 10% of babies screened for ROP will need to be treated. This can involve: Laser surgery. Small laser beams are used to treat the sides of the retina. This stops the growth of abnormal blood vessels. It takes 30-45 minutes per eye. This is the most common way ROP is treated, and it's been done safely for many years. But your baby may lose some or all of their peripheral (side) vision. Cryotherapy. Instead of burning away the scars, freezing cold temperatures are used to stop more blood vessels from spreading on the retina. This is an older form of ROP treatment. It also causes a loss of side vision. Injection. A newer way to treat ROP is to put an anti-cancer drug into each eye. Bevacizumab ( Avastin ), or a similar medication, blocks new growth of blood vessels in tumors, and it can do the same in eyes. This treatment is promising, but more research is needed to make sure there aren't long-term side effects. It's also unclear whether the ROP may come back over time. If the retina is detached, your child's doctor may need to do a more complex surgery: Scleral buckling. A small, stretchy band is placed around the white of the eye, causing it to compress slightly. This allows the torn retina to move closer to the outer wall of the eye where it belongs. Vitrectomy. During this surgery, the clear gel (vitreous) in the center of the eye is removed and replaced with saline solution. Then, the scar tissue that's pulling the retina out of place is removed. Surgery often stops the disease from getting worse and prevents vision loss . But as many as 25% of all babies who have surgery for ROP do lose some or all of their vision. Because all children with ROP are at higher risk of eye problems later in life, your child should follow up with their eye doctor every year until they're an adult."
34,Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS),"What Is Restless Legs Syndrome? Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a nervous system disorder that causes an overpowering urge to move your legs. It’s also known as Willis-Ekbom disease. Doctors consider it a sleep disorder because it usually happens or gets worse while you’re at rest. You might have trouble sleeping or sitting for a long time, such as in a theater or a car. It may get worse if you don’t get treatment. Over time, a lack of sleep can cause problems at work or home. Restless legs syndrome affects up to 10% of people in the U.S. Anyone can get it, but it’s more common in women, and middle-aged people are more likely to have severe symptoms. Sometimes, doctors don’t recognize RLS, especially if symptoms are mild or don’t happen often. But once it’s diagnosed, treatment can often stop it. Who Gets Restless Legs Syndrome? Experts estimate that up to 7% to 10% of people in the U.S. may have restless legs syndrome, also called RLS. About 2% to 3% of them have moderate to severe symptoms that affect their quality of life. Also: More women than men get it. Doctors don't know why that is. Most people with severe RLS are middle-aged or older. While children can get RLS, it's rarer than in adults. Roughly 2% of school-age children may have RLS, and it may be more likely if they have a parent with RLS. Restless Legs Syndrome Symptoms People with restless legs syndrome have unusual feelings in their legs (like itching , crawling, pulling, aching, throbbing, or pins and needles) and a powerful urge to move their legs to make the sensations go away. The condition can also happen in other areas like the arms, chest, or head. The feelings usually happen on both sides of the body. They can also happen on only one side, or they might start on one side and then move to the other. RLS symptoms range from mild to unbearable. They might come and go, and the intensity can vary between episodes. They’re generally worse in the evening and at night. Symptoms almost always go away in the early morning, so people who have RLS can often sleep well then. For some people, symptoms may cause severe nightly sleep disruption that can impair their quality of life. Restless Legs Syndrome Causes Doctors don’t know what causes most cases of restless legs syndrome, but your genes might play a role. Nearly half of the people with RLS also have a family member with the condition. It might also be tied to: Chronic diseases. Certain long-term medical conditions include RLS symptoms, including iron deficiency, Parkinson’s disease, kidney failure or renal disease, diabetes, and peripheral neuropathy. Damage to the spinal cord may also make RLS more likely. Medications. Some drugs might make symptoms worse, including anti-nausea meds, antipsychotics, some antidepressants, and cold and allergy medications that have antihistamines. Pregnancy. Some women have RLS during pregnancy, especially in the last trimester. Symptoms usually go away within a month after delivery. Lifestyle. A lack of sleep or another sleep disorder like apnea can trigger symptoms or make them worse. So can alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine use. Restless Legs Syndrome Diagnosis There’s no medical test for RLS. Your doctor might want to talk to your sleep partner about what they’ve noticed. The five basic criteria for a diagnosis of RLS are: An overwhelming urge to move your legs, especially along with uncomfortable or unusual feelings An urge that starts or gets worse while you’re at rest An urge that goes away, either partly or totally, when you move An urge that starts or gets worse in the evening Another condition, such as leg cramps, arthritis, or muscle pains, isn’t causing it. Your doctor may use lab tests to rule out other conditions. A neurological exam can check for nerve damage or blood vessel problems. A sleep study called polysomnography can tell them if you have other sleep disorders that might cause RLS. Restless Legs Syndrome Treatment Although there’s no cure for restless legs syndrome itself, treatments can help control it so you can get a good night’s sleep. If another condition is causing your restless legs, such as an iron deficiency, your doctor will treat it. Treatment for RLS itself will target your symptoms. If your RLS is mild or moderate, some small changes to your everyday life might help: getting regular exercise; following a sleep schedule; and avoiding caffeine, alcohol, and tobacco. Other ways to treat RLS without drugs include: Leg massages Hot baths Heating pads or ice packs on your legs Medications help some people. But a drug that eases symptoms in one person may make them worse in another, or a drug that works for a while may stop working. Drugs to treat RLS include: Dopaminergic drugs, which act on the neurotransmitter dopamine in your brain. The FDA has approved pramipexole (Mirapex), ropinirole (Requip), and rotigotine (Neupro) for moderate to severe RLS. The Parkinson's disease drug carbidopa/levodopa (Sinemet) occasionally is prescribed Benzodiazepines, a type of sedative, may help with sleep, but they can cause daytime drowsiness. Narcotic pain relievers Anticonvulsant or anti-seizure drugs such as carbamazepine (Tegretol), gabapentin (Neurontin), gabapentin enacarbil (Horizant), and pregabalin (Lyrica) Restless Legs Syndrome Prognosis Restless legs syndrome is a lifelong condition that might get worse with age. But some people go into remission and don’t have symptoms for days to years. Keep your doctor updated on how you’re doing. If you start to feel worse, they might suggest lifestyle changes or medications. It can help to talk to other people who know what you’re going through, whether it’s a family member who has RLS or a support group. Does Restless Legs Syndrome Ever Go Away by Itself? In some cases, restless legs syndrome can disappear on its own. But this is rare. Instead, for most people, symptoms get worse over time. For people with RLS symptoms caused by a medical condition, treatment of that condition can improve their RLS. When Should I See a Doctor About Restless Legs Syndrome? You should see a doctor to confirm the diagnosis of RLS and to exclude other conditions that may resemble RLS. The doctor can treat problems linked to RLS, like iron deficiency. If you have RLS, you should also see a doctor if you are: Losing sleep often Feeling depressed or anxious Having trouble concentrating You don't have to wait until one of these things happens. If you just want to feel better, see your doctor. Can Restless Legs Syndrome Turn Into Something More Serious? Most people with restless legs syndrome have the ""idiopathic"" form, meaning there's no known cause. For them, there is no risk of RLS becoming something more serious, like Parkinson's disease. Restless legs syndrome can get worse in people with other medical conditions if they don't get those conditions treated. How Can I Get a Good Night's Sleep Despite Restless Legs Syndrome? Experts agree that simply changing your behavior can often help you sleep if you have restless legs syndrome. For people with mild to moderate RLS, these steps can reduce or prevent symptoms: Cut down on caffeine. If you drink alcohol, cut back. Stop smoking, or at least cut back. Go to bed and get up at the same time each day, including weekends. Exercise regularly, but moderately (heavy exercise can worsen symptoms). Apply heat or ice, or soak in a hot bath. What Else Can I Do to Help With Restless Legs Syndrome? If you have moderate to severe RLS, it's important to find ways to handle any stress you feel from it. Here are a few ways to take control: Work with your doctor to keep your symptoms under control. Join a support group. The Restless Legs Syndrome Foundation can get you started. If you feel overwhelmed by RLS, talk with someone who treats mental health, like a psychologist or psychiatrist . Depression and anxiety sometimes come with restless legs syndrome, but the exact link isn't clear. What Is the Connection Between Iron and Restless Legs Syndrome? Low levels of iron may be a factor in some people. Getting more iron from food may help those people. Food sources of iron include lean meat, seafood, nuts, beans, vegetables, and iron-fortified grain products such as breakfast cereals. Your doctor can check your blood iron level and see if it's too low. Even in people who are not anemic and have normal iron levels, iron levels may be involved.  Some research shows that there can be lower iron levels in some brain regions in people with RLS, although their iron level is normal. So doctors may prescribe iron supplements even if a person's iron levels are within a normal range. But too much iron can lead to liver damage and other health problems. What Is the Link Between Restless Legs Syndrome and Periodic Limb Movement Disorder? Experts estimate that about 80% of people with restless legs syndrome also have periodic limb movement disorder, or PLMD. In PLMD, the arms or legs twitch or jerk during the night. The movements disturb sleep and can cause chronic sleepiness. Many people have periodic limb movement disorder by itself and will never get restless legs syndrome. If you think you may have PLMD, see your doctor."
35,What Are Ticks and What Diseases Do They Spread?,"You might already know that ticks cause Lyme disease . And maybe you’ve heard they can give you Rocky Mountain spotted fever , too. But these critters don’t stop there. In fact, they’re second only to mosquitoes in spreading disease to humans. Ticks are related to spiders, so they have eight legs. They have flat, oval bodies that swell when they eat. And they feed on the blood of all kinds of animals, from birds to deer to humans. They’re also very small. Even adult ticks are only about the size of an apple seed, unless they’ve just fed. That means they’re hard to spot, which is partly why they’re so good at passing along illnesses without getting caught. Do All Ticks Spread Disease? Mostly, it’s these ticks that gives illnesses to people: American dog tick, also called a wood tick Blacklegged tick, also called a deer tick Brown dog tick Gulf Coast tick Lone star tick Rocky Mountain wood tick Western blacklegged tick Where Do They Live? You can find at least one kind of disease-carrying tick just about anywhere in the United States, though some places have more than others. And the various regions of the country have different types, which carry different diseases. For example, Lyme disease is mostly a problem in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic area, and Upper Midwest. Ticks make their homes in wooded areas with lots of shrubs, tall grasses and weeds, and leaf litter -- all good places from which to latch on to animals walking by. They’ll settle down in overgrown patches in your yard, woodpiles, and even bird feeders. Who’s Likely to Be Bitten? It’s not just the outdoorsy types who get exposed. In fact, most people with Lyme disease got their bite while playing, gardening, or doing yardwork right outside their houses. Ticks can also hitch a ride on animals, such as pets or mice, and drop off when they pass through your yard. If you live in an area with ticks, you have a chance of being bitten. What Diseases Do They Spread? Ticks spread disease by passing along bacteria, viruses, and parasites (organisms that feed off their hosts). Most of these illnesses give you the typical flu-like symptoms, such as chills, fever, headache , and muscle aches. Anaplasmosis: In the Northeast and Upper Midwest, you get this illness from the blacklegged tick. On the West Coast, it’s from the western blacklegged tick. It gives you the typical symptoms, and it’s treated with antibiotics . Babesiosis : Another disease from the blacklegged tick in the Northeast and Upper Midwest, this time you get parasites in your red blood cells . It can be life-threatening if you are elderly, had your spleen removed, or have a weak immune system. Borrelia Mayamotoi: Once again, you get this from blacklegged ticks in the Northeast and Upper Midwest. You may get joint pain along with flulike symptoms. It’s treated with antibiotics . Colorado Tick Fever : Caused by the Rocky Mountain wood tick, you can get this in Rocky Mountain states at heights of 4,000 to 10,500 feet. You may get a fever for several days, then feel fine for a while, then have a fever for a few more days. For most, it’s a mild illness. Ehrlichiosis: The lone star tick in the south-central and eastern United States causes this one. You get the typical symptoms and, sometimes, a rash . It’s treated with antibiotics. Heartland virus: This is a newer illness found largely in the Midwestern, Northeastern, and Southern United States. You can get it from lone star ticks. Lyme disease: Probably the most widely known disease from ticks, you get Lyme from blacklegged ticks in the Upper Midwest, Mid-Atlantic States. and the Northeast and the western blacklegged tick on the West Coast. In the United States, the tick can give you two different bacteria, each of which causes Lyme disease. Early on, you may get the telltale bull’s-eye rash along with flulike symptoms. If you don’t treat Lyme disease, it can lead to severe problems, such as: Brain and nervous system problems Joint pain that doesn’t go away Heart issues Problems with memory and thinking clearly It’s usually treated with antibiotics, and the sooner you start, the better. Powassan virus : This isn’t common, but you can get it from blacklegged tick and groundhog ticks in the Great Lakes region and the Northeast. It can cause memory loss , confusion, and seizures . Red meat allergy : For some people, a bite from the lone star tick -- found from Texas to New England -- causes an allergy to red meat. You may get hives , asthma , or even a severe, life-threatening reaction called anaphylaxis . Rickettsia parkeri rickettsiosis: You get this one from the Gulf Coast tick in the South and East, especially along the coast. You get a dark scab where you were bitten, and maybe a rash. It’s treated with antibiotics. Rocky Mountain spotted fever: You can get RMSF from the American dog tick, Rocky Mountain wood tick, and brown dog tick. Despite the name, it’s most common in the Southeast. It usually starts off with a bad headache and high fever . Most people then get a rash that starts on their ankles and wrists and spreads from there. Doctors treat it with antibiotics. For best results, you need to start meds within 5 days of when symptoms show up. If it’s not treated, RMSF is life-threatening. It damages your small blood vessels, which can cause swelling in the brain , heart , and lungs . Southern tick-associated rash illness (STARI): This comes from the lone star tick. The symptoms are a lot like Lyme disease -- joint pain and a similar rash. But where Lyme disease is caused by bacteria, experts don’t know what causes STARI. Tick-borne relapsing fever: While other diseases come from hard-bodied ticks, this one is from a soft-bodied type. People have gotten it in mountainous areas from California to Ohio, usually after sleeping in more rustic cabins or homes. Without antibiotics, you’ll repeat a cycle of 3 days of fever, then 7 days without. Tularemia : You get this from a dog tick, wood tick, or lone star tick pretty much anywhere across the country. The most common symptoms are high fever and an open, painful sore where you were bitten. It can be life-threatening, but it’s treatable with antibiotics. 364D rickettsiosis: This is a newer disease found in California from the Pacific Coast tick. It causes fever and a dark scab where you were bitten."
36,  How to Manage and Treat Rosacea,"What Is Rosacea? Rosacea is a skin condition that makes your skin look flushed or red. You may also have small bumps with pus inside. It can look similar to acne or other skin problems. Symptoms differ based on the color of your skin. Flushing and blushing are often more obvious on light skin, but harder to see on brown or Black skin. This might make it harder for people with darker skin to get the right diagnosis. Even if you don't see obvious redness, you may have rosacea if your skin has: Small red bumps Bumps that contain pus Stinging, burning, and sensitivity Your doctor can suggest medicine and other treatments to manage your symptoms. You can also take steps at home to help yourself get better. Who’s most likely to have rosacea? R osacea can affect anyone, but some groups are more likely to get the condition, including: Middle-aged and older adults Women Light-skinned people, but doctors may overlook it in people with darker skin because this skin tone can hide discolored skin Rosacea Types There are four types of rosacea. But you can have symptoms of more than one type. The types of rosacea are: Erythematotelangiectatic rosacea. With this type, you have long-lasting redness on your face. Small blood vessels under your skin get larger and more visible. Your symptoms often come and go. Without treatment, the redness can get worse or even become permanent. Papulopustular rosacea. This causes pus-filled ""whiteheads"" as well as swollen red bumps that look a lot like acne. Often, they show up on your forehead, cheeks, and chin, but they can also affect your scalp, chest, or neck. Your face may also be red or flushed. If you have a serious case, these symptoms can take a while to get better. Phymatous rosacea. With this rare type, your skin gets thick and scarred. This form of rosacea most often affects your nose and can make it look swollen, bumpy, and sometimes discolored. Ocular rosacea. This type of rosacea affects your eyes, causing them to feel irritated and look bloodshot or watery. Your eyes become dry and sensitive, and you may get cysts on your eyelids. Rosacea on the face When rosacea appears on your face, your skin will look more flushed. You may also see broken blood vessels (called spider veins) and pus-filled bumps . Erythematotelangiectatic, papulopustular, and phymatous are all types of rosacea that appear on the face. Rosacea Symptoms For people with lighter skin, the main thing you may notice is redness on your cheeks, nose, chin, and forehead. Less often, the color can appear on your neck, head, ears, or chest. After a while, broken blood vessels might show through your skin, which can thicken and swell. Up to half of people with rosacea also get eye problems like redness, swelling, and pain. Rosacea can look like some other diseases, so it's important to get a diagnosis. The redness is more obvious on lighter skin. If your skin is darker, it might be harder to get the right diagnosis. (Photo credit: iStock/Getty Images) Other symptoms you may get no matter what your skin tone include: Stinging and burning of your skin Red or pus-filled bumps that may resemble pimples Patches of rough, dry skin A swollen, bulb-shaped nose Larger pores Broken blood vessels on your eyelids Bumps on your eyelids Problems with your vision Is rosacea itchy? This doesn't always happen, but rosacea can sometimes cause an itchy or tight feeling. Rosacea symptoms can come and go. They might flare up for a few weeks, fade, and then come back. Treatment for rosacea is a must, so see your doctor. If you don't take care of it, your symptoms can get worse and might become permanent. Rosacea Triggers Common triggers for rosacea include: Sun exposure Very hot or very cold weather Alcohol Very hot or spicy foods Intense exercise Stress Some cosmetic, skin, or hair products In addition, menopause and some drugs may cause flushing. To help identify your triggers, keep a diary of when symptoms appear, what you were doing, the environmental conditions, and what you think may have brought on your symptoms. Discuss this with your doctor. Rosacea Causes Doctors don't know exactly what causes rosacea. A few things that may play a role are: Your genes. Rosacea often runs in families. Blood vessel trouble. The redness on your skin might be due to problems with blood vessels in your face. Sun damage could make them get wider, which makes it easier for people to see them. Mites. They're microscopic insects. A type called Demodex folliculorum normally lives on your skin and usually isn't harmful. Some people, though, are more sensitive to the mites, or more of the mites than usual. Too many mites could irritate your skin. Bacteria. A type called H. pylori normally lives in your gut. Some studies suggest this germ can raise the amount of a digestive hormone called gastrin, which might cause your skin to look flushed. Some things about you may make you more likely to get rosacea. For instance, your chances of getting the skin condition go up if you: Have light skin, blond hair, and blue eyes Are between ages 30 and 50 Are female (or were designated as female at birth) Have family members with rosacea Had severe acne Smoke Rosacea Treatment There isn't a cure for rosacea, but treatments can help you manage the redness, bumps, and other symptoms. Your doctor can choose from among several types of medicines to treat it. Rosacea creams and other medicines applied to the skin Drugs you apply to your skin (called topicals) can help fight acne and inflammation and/or kill bacteria. They include: Azelaic acid,  a gel or foam that clears up bumps, swelling, and redness. It also stops bacteria growth on your skin. Brimonidine (Mirvaso), a gel that tightens blood vessels in the skin to get rid of some of your redness Calcineurin inhibitors such as pimecrolimus and tacrolimus Clindamycin (Cleocin, Clindagel, ClindaMax), an antibiotic that kills bacteria on your skin Erythromycin (Erygel), another antibiotic Ivermectin (Soolantra), which reduces inflammation Metronidazole (Flagyl) and doxycycline, also antibiotics Oxymetazoline (Rhofade), a cream Sodium sulfacetamide and sulfur (Avar, Sulfacet, Clenia, Plexion), antibiotics Oral medicines Isotretinoin (Amnesteem, Claravis, and others) is an acne drug sometimes prescribed for rosacea. Don't use it if you're pregnant because it can cause serious birth defects. It can take you a few weeks or months of using one of these medicines for your skin to improve. Rosacea laser treatment Your doctor can also treat rosacea with a laser that uses intense light to get rid of blood vessels that have gotten bigger. Lasers can also ease skin redness, while laser resurfacing can remove thickened skin. Your doctor may also suggest other procedures to treat your rosacea, such as: Dermabrasion , which sands off the top layer of skin Electrocautery, an electric current that zaps damaged blood vessels Rosacea Skin Care There's a lot you can do on your own to improve your symptoms. For starters, try to figure out the things that trigger an outbreak, and then avoid them. To help you do this, keep a journal that tracks your activities and your flare-ups. Also, follow these self-care tips to protect your skin and help fade redness: Put on sunscreen. To avoid symptoms triggered by sunlight, use a sunscreen with broad-spectrum coverage (it blocks UVA and UVB rays) and SPF 30 or higher. Apply it whenever you go outside. Also wear a wide-brimmed hat that covers your face. Use only gentle skin care products. Avoid cleansers and creams that have alcohol, fragrance, witch hazel, and other harsh ingredients. After you wash your face, gently blot your skin dry with a soft cloth. Use a moisturizer. It's especially helpful in cold weather, when low temps and wind can dry up your skin. Oil-free is best. Be careful with cosmetics .  Use high-quality, oil-free makeup. Massage your face. Gently rub your skin in a circular motion. Start in the middle of your face and work your way outward toward your ears. Cover up. If you want to cover your skin, use a green-tinted cover-up on your face to hide redness and broken blood vessels. Go indoors. Get out of the heat and sun and cool off in an air-conditioned room. Care for your eyes. If rosacea has made them red and irritated, use a watered-down baby shampoo or eyelid cleaner to gently clean your eyelids every day. Also put a warm compress on your eyes a few times a day. Eating an anti-inflammatory diet, like a Mediterranean diet, seems to help some people who have rosacea. It's also important to care for your emotions along with your skin problems . If you feel embarrassed by the way you look, or you think it's starting to affect your self-esteem, talk to your doctor or a counselor. You can also join a support group where you can meet people who know just what you're going through. When to See a Doctor If you have any symptoms of rosacea, especially if they cause discomfort, see your doctor.  They may refer you to a dermatologist for treatment. Timely treatment can keep your condition from getting more serious."
37,What Is Roseola?,"Roseola is a common virus that infects children under age 2. Most of the time, it’s nothing to worry about, and kids get better on their own. It's also sometimes called “sixth disease.” What Are the Symptoms? A child may not have any symptoms for 5-15 days after getting the virus that causes roseola. When symptoms do appear, the first thing you’ll notice is a sudden, high fever (over 103 F) that lasts or can come and go for 3-7 days. Other than the fever, your child might seem healthy. They may be restless or irritable. Once the fever goes away, they might also develop a raised, spotty, reddish rash , mainly on their neck and trunk. It doesn’t itch and may last just a few hours or a few days. Your child might also have diarrhea , cough , and droopy or swollen eyelids. What Causes Roseola? It’s an infection brought on by human herpesvirus 6 or, occasionally, human herpesvirus 7. It remains in the child’s body but usually remains latent, or turned off. It’s most common in infants and children between 6 and 24 months old. Diagnosis and Treatment A doctor usually knows your child has roseola because of the telltale symptoms: high fever followed by rash. Usually, no lab tests are needed. Since it’s caused by a virus, antibiotics won’t help cure it. So, your child’s doctor will likely just treat their symptoms to make them more comfortable. For high fever, they might recommend acetaminophen or ibuprofen . If your child develops other symptoms or becomes very sick, they may order blood or urine tests. Roseola is contagious, so your doctor will tell you to keep your child away from others, at least until the fever goes away. Once it’s been gone for at least 24 hours, they can play with other kids, even if they still have a rash. What Problems Can It Cause? Sometimes, a very high fever may cause seizures . If this happens to your child, they might pass out for a short time. Their arms and legs may jerk for many seconds or minutes. They could also lose control of their bladder and bowels. If your child has a seizure, call 911. Luckily, most seizures in young children don’t last long and aren’t harmful."
38,"What Is My Rotator Cuff, and Why Does It Hurt?","What Is a Rotator Cuff? Your rotator cuff is made up of muscles and tendons that keep the ball (head) of your upper arm bone (humerus) in your shoulder socket. It also helps you raise and rotate your arm. It’s a complicated process that your body makes look easy. Rotator cuff muscles Each one of the following muscles is part of the rotator cuff and plays an important role: Supraspinatus. This holds your humerus in place, keeps your upper arm stable, and helps lift your arm. Infraspinatus. This is the main muscle that lets you rotate and extend your shoulder. Teres minor. This is the smallest rotator cuff muscle. Its main job is to help with rotation of your arm away from your body. Subscapularis. This holds your upper arm bone to your shoulder blade and helps you rotate your arm, hold it straight out, and lower it. These muscles are attached to your arm bone with tendons that form a covering (cuff) over the ball of the humerus. Your rotator cuff helps you do things like get something off a high shelf and comb your hair. It’s especially important in sports like baseball, swimming , and tennis. This part of your body is made up of muscles and tendons. They keep your arm and shoulder together and allow you to move your arm. (Photo Credit: Suriya Siritam/Dreamstime) Rotator Cuff Injuries Rotator cuff tear . The tendons in your shoulder can become frayed, partially torn, or completely detached from the bone. It's often the result of wear and tear from daily use over time. You’re more likely to have this if you have a job where you need to move your arm a certain way over and over, like a painter or a carpenter, or you play sports like tennis and baseball. It also can happen suddenly if you fall on your arm or try to lift something heavy. Rotator cuff tendinopathy . Formerly called tendinitis , this is inflammation or irritation of a tendon that attaches to a bone. It causes pain in the area just outside the joint. Common types of tendinopathy include pitcher’s and swimmer’s shoulder. Bursitis . The bursa (a small sac filled with fluid that protects your rotator cuff) can get irritated when you repeat the same motion over and over again, like throwing a baseball or lifting something over your head. Bursitis also can be caused by an infection. Symptoms of Rotator Cuff Injury A rotator cuff tear or other injury may cause: Dull pain in your shoulder Weakness in your arm Trouble sleeping Pain that appears when you touch your head or reach behind your back Rotator cuff pain can limit the range of motion in your arm. You may feel grinding or crackling when you move your shoulder. Sometimes, you can have a rotator cuff injury and feel no pain at all. Diagnosing Shoulder Pain To diagnose your shoulder pain, your doctor will move your arm around, press on or around your shoulder, and test the strength of muscles in your shoulder and arms. You can't see a rotator cuff tear on an X-ray, but your doctor will be able to see other injuries to your shoulder such as arthritis or bone spurs. You may have other tests, including: Ultrasound, which shows soft tissue areas such as tendons and muscles and how your shoulder looks as it's moving. Your technician can scan your other shoulder to see how the two compare. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) , which can provide detailed images of the structure of your shoulder. Rotator Cuff Injury Treatment Most rotator cuff injuries get better over time without any kind of aggressive treatment. For tendinitis, bursitis, or a minor tear, your doctor may recommend: Rest, including avoiding repetitive motions or overhead sports (tennis, baseball, volleyball, swimming , and others) A combination of ice and heat Over-the-counter pain relievers like aspirin , ibuprofen , and naproxen Physical therapy, which includes stretching and strengthening exercises to get you more mobile If you still have pain and other symptoms after treating your rotator cuff injury at home, you may need different treatment. Steroid injections A shot of cortisone into the joint may help if your shoulder pain keeps you from sleeping or limits your daily activities. While they can provide quick pain relief, steroid shots can eventually weaken your tendons. Surgery About 80% to 85% of rotator cuff injuries are improved without surgery. Your doctor may recommend it if you're still in pain after trying other treatments. But it will depend on your age, your overall health, and what kinds of activities you do. There's no harm in trying nonsurgical options first. Doctors have found no difference in surgery outcomes if you have it right away or wait. Surgery may be the first choice, though, if you tore a tendon completely during a fall or other accident. There are several types of surgeries for rotator cuff tears, depending on how serious your injury is. You may have the tendon reattached to the bone, or you may need your shoulder completely rebuilt. Preventing Rotator Cuff Injuries Your rotator cuff can tear again after treatment or surgery, so it's important to prevent another injury. Here's what you can do: Protect your joint . Ask your doctor what movements and activities you should avoid to give your shoulder a chance to heal. Be cautious when you raise your arms over your head, and don't hold heavy items out away from your body. Pay attention to your posture, and if you do sports, check with a trainer to be sure you're using good form. Strengthen. Building up the muscles in and around your shoulder will help keep your rotator cuff stable and lessen pain. Focus on the muscles in all parts of your shoulder, in your upper back, and in your arms. Get more flexible. After strengthening, gentle stretching will restore your shoulder's range of motion, reduce achiness, and lengthen your muscles. You'll get the best results from a shoulder conditioning program if you do your exercises two to three times a week. Before you start, talk with your doctor or physical therapist about the best kinds of exercise to do. Rotator Cuff Exercises How to strengthen the rotator cuff Before starting your exercise program, take stock of the range of motion in your shoulder. This will help you rate your progress. Begin your exercises slowly. Stop when you start to feel pain. Warm up for 10 minutes before starting your exercises with a low-impact activity such as cycling on a stationary bike or walking. Practice good posture in your shoulders: While sitting or standing, focus on pulling them down and holding them down. Ice your shoulder for about 20 minutes a day. The following are easy exercises to do at home with little or no equipment. Pendulum. Place one hand on a table or countertop and lean forward. Your other arm should hang loosely at your side. Keep your back straight and bend your knees. Swing your arm gently back and forth, then from side to side, and finally in a circle. Repeat with your other arm for two sets of 10 repetitions. Shoulder stretch . Relax your shoulders and bring one arm across your chest. Bend your other arm and use it to pull the extended arm closer to your chest. Don't pull on your elbow. Hold the position for 30 seconds and relax for 30 seconds more. Do that four times, then repeat on the other side. Sleeper stretch . Lie on your side on a firm surface with the injured shoulder down. Extend your affected arm straight forward and bend your elbow at a 90-degree angle so your hand points toward the ceiling. Using your other hand, grasp your arm above the wrist and press it down toward your hip. Stop when you feel a stretch in the back of your affected shoulder. Hold this position for 30 seconds and relax for 30 seconds more. Repeat four times, three times a day. Elbow flex . Choose a weight that you can lift for three sets of eight repetitions. Stand, holding a weight in each hand with your elbows close to your sides. Slowly bend one arm, bringing the weight toward your shoulder and hold for 2 seconds. Return the weight slowly to your starting position. Repeat with the other arm. Increase the weight a pound at a time as the exercise gets easier, with a 10- to 15-pound maximum weight. Elbow pull . Attach the center of a resistance band to the knob of a closed door or another stable object. Facing the anchor point, take the ends of the band in each hand and hold your elbows bent at your sides. Step back until you feel tension. Steadily push both elbows back and then slowly return your arms to their starting position, squeezing your shoulder blades together as you pull. Do three sets of eight pulls."
39,Do I Need Physical Therapy for a Rotator Cuff Tear?,"If you have a rotator cuff tear , you’re not alone. It happens to millions of people every year. It’s a common cause of shoulder pain . The right treatment can make you feel better, keep a small injury from getting worse, and help you heal. For many people, physical therapy (PT) is the answer. It may be all you need to treat an injured rotator cuff . PT is a way to get back strength and movement after an injury. It includes things like exercise , ice, heat, massage , and equipment to help return your shoulder back to its normal range of motion. Your Rotator Cuff The rotator cuff is a group of tendons and muscles in your shoulder. They form a “cuff” over the top end of your arm. It helps you lift and rotate your arm. And it keeps the shoulder steady as your arm moves. A rotator cuff tear can be caused by different things. It can get sore from normal wear and tear over the years. This happens mostly to people over age 40. But you can also get one in a fall or by repeating the same activity over and over. When you do the same thing again and again, the rotator cuff can start to fray, like a worn sock. It can separate or tear, especially if you lift something heavy. Is PT for Me? If you think you have a tear, see your doctor. They may send you to someone who treats bones, joints, muscles, and tendons, called an orthopedic doctor. They can talk to you about surgical and nonsurgical options, including PT. Unless the injury is severe, PT is a typical starting point. Your physical therapist will ask questions about your life and the things you do. They’ll do some tests to learn more about your pain . The therapist will ask you to raise your arm, move it to the side, or push against something to see what your limits are. PT helps in lots of ways. One study shows that people who got PT for a rotator cuff tear did just as well as those who had surgery. The therapist will help you: Get back your range of motion Learn exercises to strengthen your shoulder muscles Improve the way you sit and stand (your posture) to help reduce pain Find a way to sleep that doesn’t hurt your shoulder Learn to carry objects safely Use ice or heat to ease the pain Understand why you need to keep moving Find ways to do things so that they don’t hurt your shoulder Return to your regular activities (be patient -- this can take a while) PT can also help you recover after rotator cuff surgery . It’s the same idea -- to improve strength and movement and get back to regular life. The therapist will show you how not to injure your shoulder again after surgery. As you recover, pay attention to your pain and ask for help if you need it. That’s the best way to heal your injured shoulder and keep it as strong as possible for the rest of your life."
40,What Is Retinitis Pigmentosa?,"Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a term for a group of eye diseases that can lead to loss of sight. What they have in common are specific changes your doctor sees when they look at your retina -- a bundle of tissue at the back of your eye. When you have RP, cells in the retina called photoreceptors don’t work the way they're supposed to, and over time, you lose your sight. It’s a rare disorder that’s passed from parent to child. Only 1 out of every 4,000 people get it. About half of all people with RP have a family member who also has it. The retina has two types of cells that gather light: rods and cones. The rods are around the outer ring of the retina and are active in dim light. Most forms of retinitis pigmentosa affect the rods first. Your night vision and your ability to see to the side -- peripheral vision -- go away. Cones are mostly in the center of your retina. They help you see color and fine detail. When RP affects them, you slowly lose your central vision and your ability to see color. Symptoms Retinitis pigmentosa usually starts in childhood. But exactly when it starts and how quickly it gets worse varies from person to person. Most people with RP lose much of their sight by early adulthood. Then by age 40, they are often legally blind . Because rods are usually affected first, the first symptom you may notice is that it takes longer to adjust to darkness (called “ night blindness ). For example, you may notice it when you walk from bright sunshine into a dimly lit theater. You may trip over objects in the dark or not be able to drive at night. You may start to lose your peripheral vision at the same time or soon after your night vision declines. You may get ""tunnel vision ,"" which means you can’t see things to the side without turning your head. In later stages, your cones may be affected. That will make it harder for you to do detailed work, and you may have trouble seeing colors. It’s rare, but sometimes the cones die first. You might find bright lights uncomfortable -- a symptom your doctor may call photophobia . You also may start to see flashes of light that shimmer or blink. This is called photopsia. Causes More than 60 different genes can cause the different types of retinitis pigmentosa. Parents can pass the problem genes on to their children in three different ways: Autosomal recessive RP: Each parent has one problem copy and one normal copy of the gene that's responsible, but they don’t have any symptoms. A child that inherits two problem copies of the gene (one from each parent) will develop this type of retinitis pigmentosa. Since two copies of the problem gene are needed, each child in the family has a 25% chance of being affected. Autosomal dominant RP: This type of retinitis pigmentosa requires only one copy of the problem gene to develop. A parent with that gene has a 50% chance of passing it to each child. X-linked RP: A mother who carries the problem gene can pass it down to their children. Each one of them has a 50% chance of getting it. Most women who carry the gene won’t have any symptoms. But about 1 out of every 5 will have mild symptoms. Most men who get it will have more severe cases. Diagnosis An eye doctor can tell you if you have retinitis pigmentosa. They’ll look into your eyes and do some special tests: Ophthalmoscope : The doctor will put drops into your eyes to make your pupil wider to get a better look at your retina. They will use a handheld tool to look into the back of your eye. If you have RP, there will be specific kinds of dark spots on your retina. Visual field test: You’ll look through a tabletop machine at a point in the center of your vision . While staring at that point, objects or lights will appear to the side. You’ll press a button when you see them, and the machine will create a map of how far to the side you can see. Electroretinogram : The eye doctor will put a film of gold foil or a special contact lens on your eye. Then they will measure how your retina responds to flashes of light. Genetic test : You'll submit a DNA sample to find out which form of RP you have. If you or anyone in your family is diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa, all family members should go to the eye doctor for screening. Treatment There’s no cure for retinitis pigmentosa, but doctors are working hard to find new treatments. A few options can slow your vision loss and may even restore some sight: Acetazolamide : In the later stages, the tiny area at the center of your retina can swell. This is called macular edema, and it, too, can reduce your vision. This medication can ease swelling and improve your vision. Vitamin A palmitate: High doses of this compound may slow retinitis pigmentosa a little each year. But you have to be careful because too much can be toxic. Work closely with your doctor and follow their recommendations. Sunglasses: These make your eyes less sensitive to light and protect your eyes from harmful ultraviolet rays that may speed vision loss. Retinal implant: If you have late-stage RP, you may be a candidate for a retinal implant that could provide partial sight. Argus II is the implant available in the US. It’s implanted into a single eye and paired with glasses equipped with a camera. Images are converted to electrical pulses that are sent to the retina. Many were able to locate lights and windows. Some were able to determine where other people were located in a room and about half of the subjects were able to read letters that were about 9 inches high. Other treatments under review include: Replacement of damaged cells or tissues with healthy ones Gene therapy to put healthy genes into the retina Devices and tools can help you make the most of your vision, and rehab services can help you stay independent."
41,Rett Syndrome: What to Know,"Rett syndrome is a rare, severe, and progressive disorder that affects mostly girls. It can impact your child’s ability to speak, walk, eat, or breathe easily. Parents or doctors usually notice signs of Rett syndrome in the first 2 years of a child’s life. If your child has it, it’s common for them to miss key milestones in development or lose abilities they used to have. There's no cure for this lifelong disorder, but early treatment may help your child adjust. What Causes Rett Syndrome? Most children with Rett syndrome have a mutation on the X chromosome, usually in a gene called MECP2. Exactly what this gene does, or how its mutation leads to Rett syndrome, isn’t clear. Researchers think that the single gene may influence many other genes involved in development. Although Rett syndrome is genetic, children almost never inherit the faulty gene from their parents. Rather, it’s a chance mutation that happens in DNA. How Is Rett Syndrome Different From Autism? Both conditions can make it hard to communicate and socialize. But there are key differences: Rett syndrome usually happens in girls, while autism spectrum disorder is much more common in boys. Some symptoms of Rett syndrome don’t happen with autism spectrum disorder. These include slowed rate of head growth, loss of hand skills, less mobility, and irregular breathing. A child with Rett syndrome usually prefers people more than objects and likes when you show them affection. The opposite can be true in a child with autism spectrum disorder. How Rare Is Rett Syndrome? About 1 out of every 10,000 to 15,000 girls worldwide is born with Rett syndrome. The disorder is even rarer in boys. How Is Rett Syndrome Different for Boys? When boys develop the Rett syndrome mutation, they rarely live past birth. Males have only one X chromosome (instead of the two girls have), so the effects of the genetic mutation are much more serious and almost always fatal. Most baby boys with Rett syndrome show signs of it very early on, and they have health problems starting when they’re born or soon after. They need aggressive medical treatment, meaning treatment that’s more intense than usual. What Are the Symptoms of Rett Syndrome? The age when symptoms appear varies. But most babies with Rett syndrome seem to grow normally for the first 6 months before any signs of the disorder become obvious. The most common changes usually show up when babies are between 12 and 18 months, and they can be sudden or progress slowly. Some symptoms of Rett syndrome are: Slowed growth. The brain doesn’t grow properly, and the head is usually small -- doctors call this microcephaly . This stunted growth becomes clearer as your child gets older. Problems with hand movements. Most children with Rett syndrome lose the use of their hands. They tend to wring or rub their hands together. No language skills. Between the ages of 1 to 4, social and language skills start to decline. Children with Rett syndrome stop talking and can have extreme social anxiety . They may stay away from or not be interested in other people, toys, and their surroundings. Problems with muscles and coordination. This can make walking awkward. Trouble with breathing. This can include very fast breathing (hyperventilation), forceful exhaling of air or saliva, and swallowing air. Seizures . Most people with Rett syndrome have seizures at some point in their lives. It’s also possible to have: Behavior changes . Children with Rett syndrome tend to become tense and irritable as they get older. At times they may cry or scream for a while or have long fits of laughter. Some kids with Rett syndrome also make unusual faces, lick their hands, or grasp at hair or clothes. Unusual eye motion. This can include staring or blinking intensely, crossed eyes, or shutting one eye at a time. Trouble sleeping. Your child might have a hard time falling asleep at night and nod off during the day. Or they might wake up at night screaming or crying. Scoliosis . This sideway curve in the spine is common with Rett syndrome. It usually starts when a child is between 8 and 11 years old and gets worse with age. If it becomes severe, your child may need surgery. Irregular heartbeat. Many children and adults with Rett syndrome have this serious condition, which can be life-threatening without treatment. It’s possible to have a few other symptoms, like: Less of a reaction to pain than usual Small hands and feet that often get cold Trouble chewing and swallowing Grinding teeth Bowel problems Symptoms of Rett syndrome usually don’t improve over time. It’s a lifelong progressive condition. The symptoms often get worse very slowly or don’t change. It’s rare for people with Rett syndrome to be able to live on their own. What Are the Stages of Rett Syndrome? In general, there are four stages. But the way the stages unfold and the severity of Rett vary from child to child. Stage I: Early onset. This stage usually happens when your baby is 6 months to 1 1/2 years old. It lasts for a few months to a year. The symptoms of the disorder are subtle during this time, which can make them easy for you to overlook. Your baby might make less eye contact with you and seem less interested in toys. They might also take longer than usual to sit up or crawl. Stage II: Rapid destructive. Some doctors also call this the “rapid deterioration” stage. It usually starts when a child is 1 to 4 years old, and it can last weeks to months. During this stage, your child could lose skills they used to have. It can happen quickly or gradually. You might also notice clearer symptoms of Rett syndrome, like slower head growth, unusual hand movements, rapid breathing, trouble moving or coordinating, and losing social and communication skills. Stage III: Plateau. This stage can start anytime from preschool to adulthood, and it can last for decades. Your child may continue to have trouble moving, but they may cry and get irritable less often. Their communication skills and hand use might also improve. They may start to have seizures during this stage. In general, children with Rett syndrome don’t get seizures before they’re 2 years old. Stage IV: Late motor deterioration. This stage usually starts after your child is 10, and it can last decades. It’s when your child is able to move on their own less or not at all. They may also have muscle weakness, limited range of motion in their joints, and scoliosis. But their ability to understand, communicate, and use their hands may improve a bit or stay stable. If they have seizures, they may get them less often, too. How Do Doctors Diagnose Rett Syndrome? Doctors can make the diagnosis by observing your child’s pattern of symptoms and behavior. They’ll probably also ask you about things like when the symptoms started. Because Rett syndrome is rare, doctors will first rule out other conditions, including autism spectrum disorder, cerebral palsy , metabolic disorders, and prenatal brain disorders. Genetic testing can help confirm the mutation in 80% of girls with suspected Rett syndrome. Doctors also rely on what’s called an RTT Diagnostic Criteria Worksheet. It assesses your child’s early growth and development. If you have one child with Rett syndrome, your chances of having another child with the disorder are small – even less than a 1% chance, according to the International Rett Syndrome Foundation. Still, you and your partner can get tested for gene mutations before you decide whether you want to have more kids. You can get more information by talking with an experienced genetic counselor. If a mother learns that she has an MECP2 mutation (without symptoms, just a positive blood test), any daughters she has who don’t have Rett syndrome can choose to get tested once they become old enough to have kids. It could help them find out if they also have the mutated gene. A diagnosis of Rett syndrome shouldn’t solely be based on genetic testing because the mutation can be seen in other similar conditions. What Are the Treatments? There’s no cure for Rett syndrome, but treatments can help with a child’s symptoms. They should get these treatments for their entire life. The best options for treating Rett syndrome include: Standard medical care and medication. Meds may help control symptoms like seizures, stiff muscles, and problems with sleeping, breathing, the heart, or digestive tract. Physical therapy. PT and using braces or casts can help children who need hand or joint support or have scoliosis. Sometimes, physical therapy can help them keep moving, sit more easily, walk better, and improve their balance and flexibility. Assistive devices like a walker or wheelchair might also help. Speech therapy. If your child has trouble talking, this could help them learn nonverbal ways to communicate and socialize. Occupational therapy. This can boost your child’s ability to use their hands to do things like put on clothes and feed themselves. If they have trouble making repetitive movements with their arms and hands, the occupational therapist might recommend splints that limit elbow and wrist motion. Good nutrition. Work with your child’s doctor to make sure they’re eating a balanced diet, which is important for healthy growth and better mental, physical, and social skills. Also ask the doctor what you need to do prevent your child from choking on food or vomiting while eating. Some children and adults with Rett syndrome benefit from being fed through a tube placed into the belly. Behavioral therapy. If your child has certain behavior issues, this might help improve them. It could also teach them good sleep habits that help them get a better night’s rest. Supportive services. You can look into early intervention programs as well as school, social, and job-training services for your child. What’s the Outlook? Experts believe that therapy can help children, especially girls, with Rett syndrome and their parents. Some kids may be able to go to school and learn how to socialize better. Many girls with Rett syndrome can live at least into middle age. Researchers are studying women with the disease, which was only widely recognized in the last 20 years."
42,Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV),"What Is Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV)? Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common, and very contagious, virus that infects the respiratory tract of most children before their second birthday. For most babies and young children, the infection causes nothing more than a cold. But for a small percentage, infection with RSV can lead to serious, sometimes life-threatening problems such as pneumonia or bronchiolitis, an inflammation of the small airways of the lungs. RSV Symptoms RSV infection can cause cold-like symptoms, including a cough and runny nose, which usually last 1 to 2 weeks. When to see a doctor: Call your baby's doctor if you notice any of the following RSV symptoms: A high-pitched whistling or wheezing noise when they breathe Being unusually upset or inactive A cough with yellow, green, or gray mucus Trouble breathing or pauses in their breaths Refusing to breastfeed or bottle-feed Signs of dehydration: lack of tears when crying, little or no urine in their diaper for 6 hours, and cool, dry skin If your baby is very tired, breathes rapidly, has difficulty in breathing, or has a blue tint to their lips or fingernails, call 911 or go to the ER immediately. RSV Causes and Risk Factors Respiratory syncytial virus spreads through the air, like after a cough or a sneeze, and through direct contact like touching. The chance of a severe infection is highest for: Babies born prematurely Children younger than 2 who were born with heart or lung disease Infants and young children whose immune systems are weakened because of illness or medical treatment Children under 8 to 10 weeks old RSV Diagnosis To diagnose RSV, your child’s doctor will probably look at their medical history and do a physical exam, including listening to their lungs. Your doctor might do some tests if your child is very sick or in order to rule out other problems. Tests for RSV include: Blood and urine tests to look for a bacterial infection and make sure your child isn’t dehydrated Chest X-rays to look for any signs of pneumonia Tests of material scraped out of your child’s nose or mouth RSV Prevention Steps you can take to try to avoid and prevent RSV include: Avoid kissing your baby if you have cold symptoms. Clean and disinfect hard surfaces. Don’t let anyone smoke around your baby. If possible, keep your baby away from anyone, including siblings, with cold symptoms. Keep your baby away from crowds. Ask people to wash their hands before they touch your baby. Limit the time high-risk babies and young children stay in daycare, particularly from late fall to early spring, when RSV is most common. Wash your hands often, especially after contact with anyone who has cold symptoms. A medication called palivizumab may prevent RSV infections and protect high-risk babies from serious complications of RSV infection. If your baby is at high risk, your doctor may give them a monthly shot of it during peak RSV season. While palivizumab is a short acting monoclonal antibody, there is a long acting monoclonal antibody called nirsevimab that may be approved this year for infants . Also, a vaccine for pregnant people is expected to be presented to the FDA for approval in 2023. Older adults can also be susceptible to RSV and two vaccines should be available later in 2023 for those 60 and older to help them avoid serious illness and hospitalization. RSV Treatments Although palivizumab may help prevent serious complications of RSV infection, doctors don’t use it to treat RSV. No medication treats the virus itself. So caring for a baby with RSV infection involves treating the symptoms and how it affects your baby’s respiratory system . Most babies and young children can be cared for at home: Remove sticky nasal fluids with a bulb syringe and saline drops. Use a cool-mist vaporizer to keep the air moist and make breathing easier. Give your little one fluids in small amounts throughout the day. Use non-aspirin fever-reducers such as acetaminophen. Check the label and follow all directions carefully. Babies with more serious cases may need to go to a hospital, where their treatment may include: Oxygen IV fluids Medications or procedures (intubation) to open their airways"
43,Rubella,"What Is Rubella? Rubella is a contagious infection caused by a virus that includes symptoms like a rash , fever , and eye redness. You may also hear rubella called “German measles” or the “3-day measles.” It mostly affects children but is usually mild. Rubella can, however, cause serious conditions or be fatal to your unborn baby if you become infected during pregnancy . The best way to protect yourself and your children from infection is to get vaccinated with the measles , mumps , and rubella (MMR) vaccine . Rubella vs. rubeola Rubeola is another name for measles. Both rubeola and rubella are caused by viruses and have similar symptoms, including skin rash, fever,  and upper respiratory infection. Rubella, however, comes with milder symptoms than rubeola and is less contagious. Rubella is a contagious infection that mostly affects children and causes symptoms like a rash, fever, and eye redness. It’s usually mild in kids but can be serious in people who are pregnant and in unborn babies. The best means of protection is to get vaccinated with the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. (Photo credit: Allan Harris/Medical Images) Rubella Symptoms Rubella is usually mild in children. Sometimes it doesn't cause any symptoms. A pink or red-spotted rash is often the first sign of infection in people with light skin tones. In people with darker skin tones, the rash may appear hyperpigmented or darker in the affected areas and rough or bumpy. The rubella rash starts on the face and spreads to the rest of the body. The rash lasts about 3 days. This is why rubella is sometimes called the ""3-day measles."" Along with the rash, you or your child might have: A mild fever -- from 99 F to 100 F Swollen and pink-colored eyes ( conjunctivitis ) Headache Swollen glands behind the ears and on the neck Stuffy, runny nose Cough Sore joints (more common in young women) General discomfort Swollen and enlarged lymph nodes Rubella Causes Rubella is caused by a virus. It used to be called ""German measles,"" though it’s not caused by the same virus that causes measles . Transmission of Rubella Rubella spreads when someone who is infected coughs or sneezes tiny germ-filled droplets into the air and onto surfaces. If you're pregnant, you can also pass rubella to your unborn child through the bloodstream. People who catch the virus are contagious for up to a week before and a week after the rash appears. Some people don't know they're infected because they don't have symptoms, but they can still pass the virus to others. If you’ve been diagnosed with rubella, tell the people who’ve been around you, especially anyone who is pregnant. Rubella Risk Factors Until the 1960s, rubella was a common childhood infection. Thanks to the MMR vaccine , the virus stopped spreading in the U.S. around 2004. Yet it still spreads in other parts of the world. People from certain areas where the virus is still active could carry the rubella virus when they travel. Anyone can catch rubella if they're exposed to the virus and haven't been vaccinated. Pregnant women face serious risks because rubella can cause serious complications to the baby during pregnancy, including death or serious birth defects like congenital deafness. Rubella Diagnosis If your doctor thinks you have rubella, you may get blood tests and a virus culture to confirm the infection. The virus culture comes from a throat or nasal swab or from a urine sample. The blood test will show different types of antibodies in your blood. Rubella antibodies There are two types of rubella-specific antibodies that appear in your body after infection, including: Rubella IgM. This antibody appears soon after you are infected with rubella or vaccinated against it. It can last in your body for up to 3 months. Rubella IgG. Rubella IgG occurs about 4 days after you develop the rash that comes with rubella and peaks within 1 to 2 weeks afterward. This antibody can last for a lifetime in your body. The best time to test for the antibodies is within 5 days of having a fever or a rash, when more than 90% of cases of rubella are positive for rubella IgM. Rubella vs. measles Your doctor may give you a blood test or take a virus culture to confirm rubella. The presence of rubella-specific antibodies will confirm whether you're infected or were recently infected or vaccinated. With measles, your doctor would use a blood test and a throat or nose swab to confirm a diagnosis. Rubella Treatment It’s a virus, so antibiotics won’t work. Most of the time, the infection in children is so mild, it doesn't need to be treated. You can bring down your child's fever and ease aches with pain relievers like children's acetaminophen or ibuprofen . Don't give your child or teen aspirin because of the risk for a rare but serious condition called Reye's syndrome, which causes swelling in the brain and liver. If you’re pregnant and think you’ve caught rubella, call your doctor right away. You may be able to take antibodies called hyperimmune globulin to help your body fight the virus. As for home remedies for rubella, there aren’t any that make the virus go away faster. But rest and pain relievers can help with self-care in mild cases, if needed. Rubella and Pregnancy It's best to be protected against rubella before you get pregnant , as getting infected during your first trimester can cause serious conditions or even death in your unborn baby. In fact, the most common cause of congenital deafness is rubella infection during pregnancy. Some women who get rubella during pregnancy have a miscarriage . In other cases, the baby doesn't survive long after birth. If you are planning to become pregnant, check your vaccination records to confirm you have received the MMR vaccine (the second and last recommended vaccination dose is given between the ages of 4 and 6 years). You should wait at least 4 weeks after getting the vaccine to become pregnant. If you’re already pregnant, you shouldn’t get the vaccine. While you're pregnant, you'll go through a routine screening to check for rubella immunity during pregnancy. If you're not sure whether you've had the MMR, tell your doctor immediately. They can use a blood test to check your immunity. Congenial rubella syndrome (CRS) Congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) is a condition that happens when a child becomes infected with the rubella virus via their mother during pregnancy. If you're infected with rubella during early pregnancy, you could have a miscarriage or your baby could be stillborn, born with birth defects, or hearing impairment. The risk of your baby being infected with the rubella virus and being born with serious associated conditions is greatest during your first trimester of pregnancy (through week 12) and decreases afterward (rare after the 20th week). If your child has CRS, they often have more than one serious condition, the most common of which include developmental delay, cataracts, congenital heart disease, and hearing impairment. It's possible for children with CRS to have only one condition; if this is the case, they usually have hearing impairment. Rubella Complications The most serious complications could happen during pregnancy, when the virus can pass from you to your baby in the womb. The risk is highest during the first 3 months of pregnancy. Babies who are infected can have serious conditions at birth like CRS. This is very rare in the U.S., but a baby can get it if they travel to another country where the virus spreads. CRS health problems in a baby can include: Heart defects Cataracts Deafness Delayed learning Liver and spleen damage Diabetes Thyroid problems Rubella can also cause complications in women who aren't pregnant, and in men. Young girls and women who get it can develop sore joints ( arthritis ). This side effect usually goes away within 2 weeks, but a small number of women will have it long term. It rarely happens in men and children. In rare cases, rubella can cause more serious health problems, like brain infections or swelling and bleeding problems. Rubella Prevention The best way to prevent rubella is to get vaccinated. Children need two doses of the MMR vaccine. They should get the first when they’re between 12 and 15 months old. They should get the second between 4 and 6 years old. Babies who’ll be traveling to a country where rubella is common can get vaccinated as early as 6 months old. If you're of childbearing age and you haven't been vaccinated, get the MMR vaccine at least 1 month before you get pregnant . This is most important if you plan to travel to countries where rubella spreads. Rubella vaccination Vaccination against rubella is normally provided as a combination vaccine, called the MMR (measles-mumps-rubella) vaccine. It could also include the vaccine against chickenpox (varicella), which is called the MMRV vaccine. It's recommended that children get the vaccine between 12 and 15 months of age and again between ages 4 and 6 years. When you get the vaccine, you're protected against rubella for life. If you've received the vaccine and have a baby, your baby is protected against rubella for 6 to 8 months. Getting the vaccine can prevent rubella during future pregnancies. Takeaways Rubella is a contagious disease that mostly affects children and causes symptoms like a rash , fever , and eye redness. It’s usually mild in kids but can be serious during pregnancy and in unborn babies. The best way to protect yourself and your children from infection is to get vaccinated with the measles , mumps , and rubella (MMR) vaccine to avoid long-term complications. Rubella FAQs What are the long term effects of rubella? Some women or people assigned female at birth may have arthritis. What happens if a pregnant woman is exposed to rubella? If you're pregnant and are not vaccinated, your unborn baby is at risk for health concerns like growth delays, deafness, and developmental issues. Some people who get rubella during pregnancy have a miscarriage . In other cases, the baby doesn't survive long after birth. When are you contagious with rubella? If you have rubella, you're contagious for about 1 week before the rash begins to 1 week after the rash disappears. How is the rubella virus transmitted? The rubella virus can be passed when an infected person coughs or sneezes or when contact is made with mucus from their nose or throat. People who are pregnant can pass it on to their child through their blood."
44,Herniated Disk Diagnosis,"Could I Have a Herniated Disk? Back pain can sneak up on you when you least expect it. One minute you're sitting comfortably in front of the TV, and the next you try to stand up, and -- ouch! -- a sharp pain radiates through your lower back. Could you have a slipped or herniated disk? You might. The adult spine is made up of 24 bones called vertebrae. Some of the vertebrae are cushioned by soft disks made of a jellylike substance. These disks allow you to move your spine around and bend over. But if a disk between two vertebrae starts slipping out of place, it can irritate the surrounding nerves and cause extreme pain. The condition is called a slipped, ruptured, or herniated disk. Signs of a Herniated Disk One sign may be where the pain is. Although herniated disks can happen in any part of your spine, they are most common in the lower part of your backbone (the lumbar spine), just above your hips. The pain may spread from your back to your buttocks, thighs, and even to your calves . Discomfort from a herniated disk usually gets worse when you're being active and lessens when you're resting. Even coughing , sneezing , and sitting can worsen your symptoms because they put pressure on pinched nerves. A herniated disk also can give you a feeling of tingling or numbness. The affected part of your back may also feel weak. Age also plays a role. As you get older, your disks tend to break down and lose their cushioning. That makes a herniated disk more likely. Herniated Disk Diagnosis The best way to tell if you have a herniated disk is to see your doctor. They’ll likely do a physical exam to find the source of your pain. This usually is the only test you’ll need to confirm a diagnosis. Your doctor will check your back for sore or painful spots. They may ask you to lie on your back and lift or move your legs in certain ways. If you feel pain, it’s likely a herniated disk. They may also check: Your reflexes at the knee and ankle Your leg strength How you walk on your heels and toes Whether you can feel light touches or vibrations If your doctor wants to rule out other sources of your pain, or pinpoint specific nerves that are aggravated, they may do further testing, including: X-rays. While a standard X-ray can't show if you have a herniated disk, it can show your doctor the outline of your spine and rule out whether your pain is caused by something else, such as a fracture or tumor. Myelogram. This test uses dye injected into your spinal fluid, and an X-ray to locate the pressure on the spinal cord. CT scan . A CT (or CAT) scan takes several X-rays from different angles and combines them to create images of your spinal cord and the structures surrounding it. MRI . An MRI uses radio waves, a magnetic field, and a computer to create detailed 3D images of the spinal cord and surrounding areas. MRI images can locate the position of the herniated disk, look inside it, and also determine which nerves are affected. Electromyogram (EMG). Your doctor might use these tests to see if any nerves are damaged or compressed. The EMG test uses a device to detect the tiny amount of electricity muscle cells make when they're stimulated by nerves connected to them. A needle electrode put into a muscle records its electrical activity and looks for anything that isn’t as it should be. Nerve conduction studies (NCS) are often done at the same time as the EMG. In this test, the nerves are stimulated with tiny electrical impulses by an electrode at one point on the body while other electrodes detect the impulses at a different point. The time it takes for the electrical impulses to travel between electrodes lets your doctor know whether there is nerve damage ."
45,Understanding Encephalitis: The Basics,"What Is Encephalitis? Encephalitis (pronounced en-sef-uh- lie -tis) is inflammation of your brain tissue. It can be very serious and may cause personality changes, seizures , weakness, and other symptoms, depending on the part of your brain affected. Encephalitis is an inflammation in your brain. Most cases are caused by infection with a virus, such as the herpes simplex virus. (Photo Credit: Science Photo Library/Getty Images) Encephalitis is rare, affecting about 10-15 in 100,000 people each year in the U.S. Young children, older adults, and those with a weak immune system are most vulnerable. It's usually caused by an infection with viruses, bacteria, fungi, or parasites, although it can be caused by an autoimmune condition or some medicines as well. Most people who have mild encephalitis fully recover. Your treatment and chance of recovery depend on the cause and severity of your inflammation. In acute encephalitis, the infection directly affects your brain cells. In parainfectious encephalitis, your brain and spinal cord become inflamed within 1-2 weeks of contracting an infection (usually viral or bacterial) . Encephalitis vs. meningitis Encephalitis and meningitis are both diseases that cause inflammation in your brain. However, while encephalitis is an inflammation of your brain tissue, meningitis is an inflammation of the membranes that cover your brain and spinal cord (called meninges). Like encephalitis, meningitis is often caused by a viral or bacterial infection, but it can also be caused by fungal or parasitic infections, injuries, certain drugs, and some types of cancer. Is encephalitis contagious? Swelling in your brain isn’t contagious, but the causes can be. For example, viral encephalitis can be caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV) that can pass from person to person. Childhood diseases, such as measles, mumps, and German measles (Rubella), used to be a common cause of viral encephalitis in kids, but these causes are a bit rarer now since most people get vaccinated against them before they start school. Encephalitis Causes Viral infections with any of the following three groups of viruses are the most common cause of encephalitis. These include: Herpes viruses, which include HSV (especially HSV-1), chickenpox, cytomegalovirus, and Epstein-Barr virus Viruses that are transmitted through bugbites, such as West Nile virus , Dengue virus, and Eastern equine encephalitis virus Viruses that cause childhood infections, such as measles, mumps, and Rubella Less commonly, encephalitis may be caused by: Infection with HIV or the virus that causes rabies Bacterial and other infections, such as syphilis or toxoplasmosis (an infection with a parasite from infected cat poop) Autoimmune conditions Some kinds of cancer Some medicines Sometimes, your doctor may not be able to tell what caused your encephalitis. Encephalitis Types Infectious encephalitis It is usually caused by a viral infection but can also be caused by bacteria, fungi, and parasites. As it's usually caused by viral infections, it's more common in people who are exposed to bugs that can transmit diseases, such as people who spend a lot of time outdoors, especially near standing water. Infectious encephalitis can develop quickly and the symptoms can be serious. Autoimmune encephalitis It is usually caused by proteins that your body makes in your brain. These proteins cause inflammation in your brain. Doctors don't yet know for sure why some people develop these proteins, while other people don't. Autoimmune encephalitis tends to develop more slowly than infectious encephalitis and may cause more neurological symptoms, such as confusion, memory issues, and seizures. It's also rarer than infectious encephalitis. Some conditions that are linked to autoimmune encephalitis include: Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis Hashimoto’s encephalopathy LGI1/CASPR2-antibody encephalitis Limbic encephalitis Rasmussen’s encephalitis Both infectious and autoimmune encephalitis can cause serious, life-threatening symptoms. If you or someone else has neurological symptoms, such as irritability, seizures, or extreme drowsiness, call 911 or go to the emergency room right away. Encephalitis Symptoms Your symptoms depend on the type of encephalitis you have. People with infectious encephalitis may have symptoms of an infection before they get encephalitis. Signs of encephalitis can include: Fatigue or loss of energy Fever, especially a high fever Headache that can be severe Sensitivity to light and sound Mild-to-moderate neck stiffness Drowsiness or loss of consciousness Irritability, anxiety, and behavioral or personality changes Hallucinations Signs of severe encephalitis may include: Weakness or trouble moving some parts of your body Double vision Confusion, trouble speaking, or difficulty understanding when someone talks to you Coma Seizures A bulging soft spot (fontanel) in infants Go to the ER or call 911 right away if you or someone else has any signs of severe encephalitis. Encephalitis Diagnosis Your doctor will ask about your symptoms, including how long you've had them. Because people with encephalitis can be disoriented, family and friends are key to getting a good history. It's important to know if you've come into contact with mosquitoes or ticks , infected animals, or sick people. Your doctor will also do a physical exam and may order some tests. Encephalitis tests Some of the tests your doctor may use include: Blood tests, including a complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel Urine, stool, or sputum culture tests to see if you have an infection and what type you have Imaging tests, such as CT scans, MRI scans, and magnetoencephalography (MEG) to see where in your brain you are having seizures Electroencephalogram (EEG) to look for seizers or specific electrical activity in your brain Spinal tap (lumbar puncture) to remove cerebrospinal fluid to find infections in your brain or spinal cord A neurological exam, which is a series of tests that show how well your nervous system is working An intracranial pressure monitoring (ICP) to measure the pressure inside your skull Rarely, a biopsy of your brain tissue to look at under a microscope Encephalitis Risk Factors Several risk factors could increase your chance of getting encephalitis. These include: Age. Young children and older adults are at a higher risk for viral encephalitis. Some types of autoimmune encephalitis are more common in children and young adults. Having a weakened immune system. This could be because you have HIV, take medicines for cancer, or have a condition such as diabetes. Having an autoimmune condition. Smoking. Living in areas where mosquito- or tick-borne viruses spread easily, particularly in the summer months. Encephalitis Treatment Because the complications from encephalitis can be serious, you may need to go to the hospital. You will usually need monitoring for your blood pressure, heart rate, and breathing. You will also usually need IV fluid therapy to help keep your brain from swelling more. Otherwise, your treatment will depend on your age, condition, and the cause of your disease. Some common treatments include: Steroids that can help reduce swelling in your brain Antiviral drugs, such as acyclovir (Zovirax), Foscarnet (Foscavir), or Ganciclovir (Cytovene) for people who have viral encephalitis Antibiotics for people with bacterial encephalitis Anticonvulsant therapy for people with seizures Immune globulin and plasmapheresis for people with autoimmune encephalitis Over-the-counter medicines, such as acetaminophen, that can help control fever and headaches Supportive care Supportive care is a type of care for patients who are seriously ill. The goal is to focus your treatment on what is most important to you. This may involve, for instance, focusing on relieving your symptoms and how other treatments will affect how you feel. You usually get supportive care alongside specific treatments for your condition. Examples of supportive care may include: Use of a ventilator or other breathing help, such as an oxygen mask IV fluids to keep you hydrated Medications for pain, inflammation, infection, seizures, and other issues Post encephalitis therapy Once you have been treated for encephalopathy and the inflammation is gone, you may still need some treatment and support to continue your recovery. Some people need help such as: Physical therapy to help regain your muscle strength to stand, walk, or perform regular tasks. Occupational therapy (OT), which often works hand in hand with physical therapy. OT helps you work on your everyday skills and may give you ideas for adaptations, such as special tools, if you need help with some of your day-to-day activities. Speech therapy, which helps you regain or fine-tune your ability to speak or communicate clearly. Brain rehabilitation or retraining, which helps you improve your memory and your cognition. Psychotherapy, which helps you learn how to cope with changes in your life and manage your moods and behavior. Encephalitis Complications After you recover from the swelling in your brain, from encephalitis, you may have long-term damage in your brain that needs ongoing medical care. For instance, some people may have long-term problems, such as: Memory loss (amnesia) Personality and behavioral changes Emotional and psychological problems, such as anxiety, depression, and mood swings Problems with attention, concentration, planning, and problem-solving Repeated seizures (epilepsy) Hearing loss Speech and language problems Problems swallowing Problems with balance, coordination, and movement Long-term fatigue In severe cases, loss of consciousness (coma) and death Encephalitis Prevention The best way to avoid getting encephalitis is to avoid the germs that can cause it. Here are some tips: Get yourself and your kids vaccinated, as recommended by your doctors. The elimination of smallpox and the availability of vaccines that prevent mumps , measles , and rubella have lowered cases of encephalitis , especially in children. If you're traveling in an area that has a high risk of tick-borne or mosquito-borne viruses, make sure you get vaccinated before you head out. The CDC's website has a travelers' health page where you can look up your destination and get a list of all the recommended vaccines for that location. Wash your hands completely and often with soap and water throughout your day, especially before you handle food, eat or drink, and after using the bathroom. Don't share food, eating utensils, or glasses. Don't share personal-care items and remind your kids not to share their things, such as razors, towels, makeup, or toothbrushes. Take these steps to avoid getting bitten by mosquitoes and ticks: Avoid being outside between dusk and dawn when mosquitoes are most likely to bite you. If do have to be out then, wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants. Make sure mosquitoes can't get into your house through broken screens and windows. Also, run a fan, which can keep mosquitos moving around so they're less likely to land on and bite you. Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants when you're in wooded areas with tall grasses and shrubs, where ticks like to hang out. Check yourself, your kids, and your pets for ticks when they come inside during tick season (this can be year-round for people in the U.S. South and on the West Coast, but for most of the U.S., it's early spring to winter). Use bug repellent and insecticide. You can use the mosquito repellent DEET on both your skin and clothes. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recommends spraying your clothes, tents, and outdoor gear with products that contain permethrin to repel and kill both mosquitoes and ticks. Don't spray permethrin on your skin, though. For infants younger than 2 months, you can't use insect repellent, so cover their carrier or stroller with mosquito netting. For infants and children older than 2 months old, you can use 10%-30% DEET products. Don't use a combined sunscreen and DEET product because you'll need to reapply sunscreen for a full day of outside play. Reapplying a DEET-containing product can expose your child to high levels of DEET. Get rid of standing water outside your house. Mosquitoes lay their eggs in standing water. Common problem areas for standing water are old flowerpots, flat roofs, old tires, and clogged gutters. Report any sick or dying birds or small animals to your local health department. They could be infected with viruses such as West Nile virus that cause encephalitis. Encephalitis Prognosis Your symptoms can last anywhere from a few days to a couple of months. Some people with complications may take another few months to fully recover. However, with treatment, most people recover from encephalitis. Your outlook depends on a few things, such as: What caused your encephalitis. Some causes, such as an HSV infection, may cause fewer issues, so people with encephalitis caused by HSV may have an easier recovery than other people. Your level of inflammation. High levels of brain inflammation can cause more long-term issues that complicate your recovery. Your age. Adults may have a harder time recovering from encephalitis. Your overall health. If you have preexisting health issues or a weakened immune system, it can make your recovery more difficult. How long it took you to be diagnosed. The longer it takes you to get treatment, the higher your chance of having a difficult recovery and lasting complications. Takeaways Encephalitis is a condition that involves inflammation and swelling in your brain. It's usually caused by infection with a virus, especially HSV. It isn’t always preventable, but you can lower your risk by avoiding infection with a germ that could lead to encephalitis. This means getting your recommended vaccines and avoiding or protecting yourself when in areas that have ticks and mosquitoes. If you have signs or symptoms of encephalitis, you should get to the doctor right away. Quick diagnosis and treatment can make your recovery easier and limit lasting effects. Although some people do experience complications, most people fully recover. Encephalitis FAQs What is the life expectancy of people with encephalitis? Most people fully recover from encephalitis and go on to live a normal life. People with mild cases may recover in a week, while people with serious cases may have complications that take months of added recovery time. One study showed that about 5% of people who are hospitalized with encephalitis die while they are in the hospital. Can encephalitis resolve on its own? If you have mild encephalitis, it can recover on its own over several weeks. Severe cases of encephalitis, however, can be life-threatening. You can't necessarily tell from your symptoms how serious your case is, so if you suspect you have encephalitis, you need to go to the doctor."
