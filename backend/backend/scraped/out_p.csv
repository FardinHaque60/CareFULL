0,What Is Hypoparathyroidism?,"[""What Is Hypoparathyroidism? Your neck has four\xa0pea-sized glands called the parathyroid glands. Hypoparathyroidism happens when they don't make enough parathyroid hormone (PTH), are surgically removed, are damaged,\xa0or when your body is resistant to that hormone. The condition can also be hereditary.\xa0PTH controls the blood level of important vitamins and minerals such as vitamin D, calcium , and phosphorus. You may also have hypoparathyroidism because you have another condition that affects how much PTH is in your body, such as a low magnesium level. Hypoparathyroidism has a link to several other health conditions, including: Addison’s disease Cataracts Pernicious anemia Your body uses calcium to keep your nerves, muscles, and heart working. Low levels of calcium can result in symptoms ranging from mild to severe muscle spasms , tingling, heart problems, and seizures . The good news is you can treat the condition. Treatment mostly means making sure your body has enough calcium and vitamin D, which you can do by eating a balanced diet , taking supplements, and keeping an eye on blood levels. If you stick with your treatment plan and see your doctor regularly, you can lead a full, active life with hypoparathyroidism."", 'Causes Several things can trigger hypoparathyroidism. They include: Injury or removal of the glands during surgery Autoimmune diseases Radiation therapy to your neck or head Low levels of magnesium Genetic disorders', 'Symptoms Some of the symptoms of low blood calcium are: Muscle cramps or spasms in your legs, feet, lower back, or face Tingling in your fingers, toes, or lips Anxiety and depression Heart failure An irregular heartbeat Low blood pressure Seizures Low calcium in the long term can lead to: Cataracts Dental problems Movement disorders like tremors Hair loss and brittle nails Bone disease', 'Getting a Diagnosis Your doctor will test your blood for calcium, PTH, phosphorus, and magnesium.', 'Questions to Ask Your Doctor What caused my hypoparathyroidism? Do I need any more tests? How often will I need to see a doctor? What kind of treatments can help? Which do you recommend? How can I keep my calcium levels normal? What kind of lifestyle changes do I need to make? Will it ever go away? Will my children get hypoparathyroidism? If your child has the disease, ask their doctor how you can make sure they get the nutrients they need to grow.', ""Treatment Calcium and vitamin D supplements can keep hypoparathyroidism in check. A healthy diet helps, too. Your doctor may tell you to: Limit foods with phosphates, like soda and other fizzy drinks. These can pull calcium from your bones. Eat foods high in calcium such as low-fat dairy products, dark green vegetables like collard greens and kale, and foods with added calcium like some cereals and orange juices. A dietitian can help you plan meals to keep you or your child healthy. Your child's doctor will check them regularly to see that their growth is on track. If normal calcium levels in your body are hard to maintain, you may need to get an injection of PTH. Once your calcium levels are normal again, you can go back to your regular treatment."", 'Taking Care of Yourself Hypoparathyroidism can usually be managed with a few simple changes in lifestyle. Here are some tips. Drink plenty of water. This helps flush out extra calcium. Aim for 6-8 glasses each day.', ""Exercise regularly. Physical activity strengthens your bones and helps ward off fractures. Ask your doctor about what kinds of exercise (and how much) are right for you. Pay attention to what you eat. Hypoparathyroidism can cause you to have too little calcium and too much phosphorus in your blood. Because of this, you might need to track how much of these nutrients you eat each day. Foods high in calcium include: Dairy products, like milk or cheese Beans Tofu Nuts, especially almonds Dark leafy greens Broccoli Some juices, breads, and cereals also have calcium added to them. If possible, try to get most of your calcium through food instead of supplements. Your body absorbs it better that way. Avoid foods high in phosphorus. It might be called phosphates or phosphoric acid in the ingredient list. These include: Fizzy drinks Processed foods Red meat Poultry Fish Dairy Hard cheeses Nuts Whole grains, like rice, oats, and bread Some vegetables Keep in mind that some foods are high in both calcium and phosphorus. Ask your doctor or nutritionist to help you figure out what's right for you."", 'Take supplements. Your doctor might recommend calcium or vitamin D supplements. Vitamin D helps your body get more calcium from food. It also helps get rid of phosphorus. You might also need a magnesium supplement if you have low magnesium levels. The doctor can tell you how much of each supplement to take. Some supplements, like calcium, work better if you take them with food. Stay in touch with your doctor. Hypoparathyroidism can affect the whole body, especially your kidneys and bones. Your doctor can keep an eye on these organs with regular blood tests and bone density scans. See your dentist regularly. Too little calcium can hurt your teeth .', ""What to Expect As long as you get enough calcium and vitamin D and have your blood checked regularly, you should be able to keep your hypoparathyroidism under control. If you don't take your daily supplement and watch your diet, the condition can be dangerous."", 'Getting Support For more information, visit the web site of the Hypoparathyroidism Association .']"
1,Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH),"[""What Is Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria? It’s a rare blood disease that stems from your genes. If you have it, your immune system attacks red blood cells in your body and breaks them down. They lack certain proteins that protect them. You can get paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) at any age. You aren’t born with it. Although it can be life-threatening, treatments can help you feel better and control some of its complications. The condition affects everyone differently. Some people have only minor problems. For others, it's much more severe. The biggest risk is blood clots. Up to 30% of people with PNH have one at some point."", ""Causes PNH is caused by a problem with a gene. But you don't get it from your parents, and you can't pass it on to your kids. A change in a gene, called a mutation, causes your body to make abnormal red blood cells. These cells don’t have proteins that shield them from your immune system. So your body breaks them down. Scientists call this process “hemolysis.”"", 'Some doctors believe PNH is related to weak bone marrow. People with a certain type of anemia, called aplastic anemia, are more likely to get PNH. The reverse is also true: People with PNH are more likely to get aplastic anemia, though not everyone does. In this condition, your bone marrow stops making new blood cells.', 'Symptoms The condition gets its name from one of its symptoms: dark or bright red blood in your urine at night or in the morning. ""Paroxysmal"" means ""sudden,"" ""nocturnal"" means ""at night,"" and ""hemoglobinuria"" means ""blood in the urine."" It happens in up to 50% of people with PNH. Symptoms of the disease are caused by: Broken red blood cells Too few red blood cells (which can cause anemia) Blood clots in your veins You could have many symptoms or just a few. Usually, the more of the faulty blood cells you have in your body, the more the condition will affect you. Broken red blood cells and anemia may make you: Feel tired and weak Have headaches Feel short of breath Have an irregular heartbeat Have belly pain Have trouble swallowing Have pale or yellowish skin Bruise easily Men may have trouble getting or keeping an erection', 'The symptoms of blood clots depend on where the clot happens: Skin: Red, painful, or swollen area Arm or leg: Sore, warm, and swollen limb Stomach: Pain Ulcers and bleeding Brain: Bad headache with or without vomiting Seizures Trouble moving, talking, or seeing Lungs: Trouble breathing Sharp chest pain Coughing up blood Sweating Blood clots can be dangerous. If you think you may have one, call your doctor right away. Call 911 if you have any trouble breathing or moving, talking or seeing,\xa0have a sudden headache, any chest pain,\xa0or have a seizure.', ""Getting a Diagnosis Your doctor will ask about your medical history and any symptoms you’ve noticed. They may also ask you: Have you noticed blood in your urine? What medications do you take? Have you had any signs of blood clots? Have you had any stomach or digestive problems? Have you been tested for aplastic anemia or a bone marrow disorder? You will get routine blood tests. One will count the number of blood cells you have. You will probably also get other tests, such as flow cytometry, which checks whether your red blood cells have the proteins that should protect them. Your doctor may also check your iron levels or get a sample of your bone marrow. If you have symptoms of a blood clot, they'll use other tests to look for those, too."", 'Questions for Your Doctor You’re probably going to have a lot of things to ask about. Use this list to help you get the information you need. What makes you sure that I have PNH? Do I need any more tests? What is my level of PNH cells? Will I feel differently over time? Are some symptoms more dangerous than others? What can I do to feel better? What are my treatment options? How will they make me feel? How will we know if the treatment is working? Would a bone marrow transplant help me? If so, how do I find a good match for a transplant? Can I take part in a clinical trial? Will I be able to have children?', 'Treatment Most treatments for PNH aim to ease symptoms and prevent problems. Your treatment will depend on how severe your symptoms and disease are. If you have only a few symptoms from anemia, you may need: Folic acid to help your bone marrow make more normal blood cells Iron supplements to make more red blood cells Eculizumab ( Soliris ). This drug\xa0prevents the breakdown of red blood cells. This can improve anemia, lower or stop the need for blood transfusions, and reduce blood clots. It can make you more likely to get a meningitis infection, so you may need to get a meningitis vaccine. Ravulizumab ( Ultomiris ). Ravulizumab is virtually identical to eculizumab but has been shown to last longer. Instead of biweekly infusions, patients only need six or seven infusions a year. Pegcetacoplan ( Empaveli) is a targeted therapy that can be prescribed for those who are new to treatment or are switching from eculizumab or revulizumab.', ""Other treatments include: Blood transfusions. These help treat anemia, the most common PNH problem. Blood thinners. These medicines make your blood less likely to clot. Bone marrow stem cell transplant. This procedure is the only cure for PNH. To get one, you’ll need someone healthy, usually a brother or sister, to donate stem cells to replace the ones in your bone marrow. These are not “embryonic” stem cells. Usually, due to serious health risks, doctors offer a bone marrow transplant only to young people with severe PNH. If your doctor thinks it would work for you, talk with them about the risks and benefits. If your PNH doesn't get better with usual treatments, you may want to ask your doctor if you can take part in a clinical trial. These research studies try out new ways to treat PNH, before they’re available to everyone. Ask your doctor what’s involved and what you should consider before you sign up."", 'Take Care of Yourself When you have PNH, it’s even more important to take good care of yourself, so you feel your best. Eat a healthy diet. Your body absorbs iron better when you get it with vitamin C. Try combos like iron-fortified cereal with strawberries or spinach salad with orange slices.', ""Exercise. Fatigue makes it harder to stay active. Ask your doctor what kind of workout is best for you. If your red blood cell count is very low, skip activities that make your heart beat faster, hurt your chest, or strain your breathing. Protect yourself. Try not to get infections. Wash your hands often, and avoid crowds and sick people. Tell your doctor if you have a fever or feel more tired than usual. Ask if you are up to date on your vaccines. Get support. Talk with other people who know what you're going through. Ask your doctor about ways to get connected, such as a PNH support group that meets locally or online."", ""If you’re a woman who wants to get pregnant, talk to your doctor first. PNH can cause problems that make pregnancy risky for you and your baby. If you do become pregnant, your doctors will closely follow how you and the baby are doing. Tend to your emotions. They’re part of your health, too. It’s OK to feel anger, sadness, or stress after your diagnosis. You may find that it helps to talk with a counselor, especially if those feelings start to affect your daily life. Ask your doctor for a referral. You may also want to consider joining a support group, where you can talk with other people who understand what you’re going through because they’ve been there, too. Ask your doctor about that, too. Your friends and family will want to know what's going on with you and what they can do for you. Let them know what would be helpful."", ""What to Expect PNH is different for everyone. It's hard to predict if you'll have milder or more serious symptoms, or if you’ll develop other conditions. The disease can also make you more likely to have other blood-related conditions like aplastic anemia and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). MDS is a group of bone marrow diseases in which you have trouble making normal blood cells. PNH also raises your chances of developing a type of leukemia, a cancer that starts in your bone marrow."", 'Getting Support The Aplastic Anemia & MDS International Foundation can help you connect with other people who have PNH and find the services you need.']"
2,Specific Phobias,"['The term ""phobia"" refers to a group of anxiety symptoms brought on by certain objects or situations. A specific phobia, formerly called a simple phobia, is a lasting and unreasonable fear caused by the presence or thought of a specific object or situation that usually poses little or no actual danger. Exposure to the object or situation brings about an immediate reaction, causing the person to endure intense anxiety (nervousness) or to avoid the object or situation entirely. The distress associated with the phobia and/or the need to avoid the object or situation can significantly interfere with the person\'s ability to function. Adults with a specific phobia recognize that the fear is excessive or unreasonable, yet are unable to overcome it. There are different types of specific phobias , based on the object or situation feared, including: Animal phobias : Examples include the fear of dogs, snakes, insects, or mice. Animal phobias are the most common specific phobias. Situational phobias : These involve a fear of specific situations, such as flying, riding in a car or on public transportation, driving, going over bridges or in tunnels, or of being in a closed-in place, like an elevator. Natural environment phobias : Examples include the fear of storms, heights, or water. Blood -injection-injury phobias : These involve a fear of being injured, of seeing blood or of invasive medical procedures, such as blood tests or injections Other phobias : These include a fear of falling down, a fear of loud sounds, and a fear of costumed characters, such as clowns. A person can have more than one specific phobia.', 'What Are the Symptoms of Specific Phobias? Symptoms of specific phobias may include: Excessive or irrational fear of a specific object or situation Avoiding the object or situation or enduring it with great distress Physical symptoms of anxiety or a panic attack, such as a pounding heart , nausea or diarrhea , sweating , trembling or shaking, numbness or tingling, problems with breathing (shortness of breath), feeling dizzy or lightheaded, feeling like you are choking Anticipatory anxiety , which involves becoming nervous ahead of time about being in certain situations or coming into contact with the object of your phobia; for example, a person with a fear of dogs may become anxious about going for a walk because they may see a dog along the way. Children with a specific phobia may express their anxiety by crying, clinging to a parent, or throwing a tantrum.', 'How Common Are Specific Phobias? The National Institute of Mental Health estimates that about 5%-12% of Americans have phobias. Specific phobias affect an estimated 6.3 million adult Americans. Phobias usually first appear in adolescence and adulthood, but can occur in people of all ages. They are slightly more common in women than in men. Specific phobias in children are common and usually disappear over time. Specific phobias in adults generally start suddenly and are more lasting than childhood phobias. Only about 20% of specific phobias in adults go away on their own (without treatment).', 'What Causes Specific Phobias? The exact cause of specific phobias is not known, but most appear to be associated with a traumatic experience or a learned reaction. For example, a person who has a frightening or threatening experience with an animal, such as an attack or being bitten, can develop a specific phobia. Witnessing a traumatic event in which others experience harm or extreme fear can also cause a specific phobia, as can receiving information or repeated warnings about potentially dangerous situations or animals. Fear can be learned from others, as well. A child whose parents react with fear and anxiety to certain objects or situations is likely to also respond to those objects with fear.', ""How Are Specific Phobias Diagnosed? If symptoms of a specific phobia are present, the doctor will begin an evaluation by performing a medical and psychiatric history and may perform a brief physical exam . Although there are no lab tests to specifically diagnose specific phobias, the doctor may use various tests to make sure that a physical illness isn't the cause of the symptoms."", ""If no physical illness is found, you may be referred to a psychiatrist, psychologist , or other mental health professional who is specially trained to diagnose and treat mental illnesses. Psychiatrists and psychologists use clinical interviews and assessment tools to evaluate a person for a specific phobia. The doctor bases their diagnosis of specific phobias on reported symptoms, including any problems with functioning caused by the symptoms. A specific phobia is diagnosed if the person's fear and anxiety are particularly distressing or if they interfere with their daily routine, including school, work, social activities, and relationships."", 'How Are Specific Phobias Treated? Treatment for specific phobias may include one or a combination of: Cognitive behavioral therapy : Psychotherapy is the cornerstone of treatment for specific phobias. Treatment usually involves a type of cognitive behavioral therapy, called systematic desensitization or exposure and response prevention (ERP) therapy, in which patients are gradually exposed to what frightens them until their fear begins to fade. Medication : For situational phobias that produce intense, temporary anxiety (for example, a fear of flying), short-acting sedative-hypnotics (benzodiazepines) such as alprazolam ( Xanax ) or lorazepam ( Ativan )\xa0may be prescribed on an occasional, as-needed basis to help reduce anticipatory anxiety. Unless a phobia is accompanied by other conditions such as depression or panic disorder, long-term or daily medicines are generally not used. Occasionally, serotonergic antidepressants such as escitalopram oxalate ( Lexapro ), fluoxetine ( Prozac ),\xa0and paroxetine ( Paxil ) may have potential value for some patients. More recently, common blood pressure drugs called beta-blockers have been used to treat anxiety related to specific phobias. Relaxation techniques , such as deep breathing, may also help reduce anxiety symptoms.', 'What Is the Outlook for People With Specific Phobias? For most people, specific phobias can be successfully treated with therapy, medication , or a combination of both.', 'Can Specific Phobias Be Prevented? Although many specific phobias cannot be prevented, early intervention and treatment following a traumatic experience, such as an animal attack, may prevent the person from developing a severe anxiety disorder.']"
3,Hives: What You Need to Know,"['These itchy welts can show up anywhere on your skin . They’re caused by an allergy or as a reaction to stress or viruses.\xa0Your doctor may call them urticaria. They can last a few minutes or several days before they go away. Sometimes they’re a sign of more serious problems, especially when you have trouble breathing . With an outbreak of hives, you may notice: Raised, skin-colored or reddish welts of varying size on the skin . The welts itch intensely, often at night. Welts come and go over minutes or hours. Hives that come back or that last more than 6 weeks are considered chronic urticaria and require further evaluation. If you have hives along with fever, nausea , stomach cramps , shortness of breath, and a drop in blood pressure after a bee sting , insect bite , or drug injection, that can be a sign of a life-threatening allergy . If your doctor has prescribed an epinephrine auto-injector for you, make sure you have two with you at all times. Use one and then call 911 or go to the hospital.', 'What Is Angioedema? Another reaction that sometimes happens along with hives is called angioedema. It’s swelling that develops under the skin. It often affects the eyes and lips, and sometimes the genitals, hands, and feet. It’s rare, but the swelling from angioedema can happen in your throat and cause trouble breathing . If that happens, use an auto-injector and call 911.', 'What Causes Hives? They pop up when skin cells release a substance called histamine . It’s the start of the process we call an allergic reaction . Common triggers for hives include: Foods like milk, fish, or nuts Drugs like aspirin or penicillin Food additives like flavorings and preservatives Bug bites Extreme cold or heat Pressure on the skin Viral infections Skin contact with allergens', ""How Do You Treat Hives? There’s one surefire way: Figure out what’s causing them and stay away from it. You can take antihistamines to ease your symptoms. If over-the-counter medicine doesn't help or your hives won’t go away, see your doctor. They may prescribe steroid pills or prescription antihistamines . At home, try these tips: Apply cool compresses or wet cloths to the hives. Try to work and sleep in a cool room. Wear loose-fitting, lightweight clothes.""]"
4,Mental Health and Pica,"['Pica is the persistent eating of substances such as dirt or paint that have no nutritional value. The Handbook of Clinical Child Psychology currently estimates that prevalence rates of pica range from 4%-26% among institutionalized populations. Research among non-institutionalized populations takes the form of individual case studies, making prevalence rates difficult to estimate.', ""How Is Pica Diagnosed? If pica is suspected, a medical evaluation is important to assess for possible anemia , intestinal blockages, or potential toxicity from ingested substances. If symptoms are present, the doctor will begin an evaluation by performing a complete medical history and physical exam . The doctor may use certain tests -- such as X-rays and blood tests -- to check for anemia and look for toxins and other substances in the blood , and to check for blockages in the intestinal tract . The doctor also may test for possible infections caused by eating items contaminated with bacteria or other organisms. A review of the person's eating habits\xa0may be conducted. Before making a diagnosis of pica, the doctor will evaluate the presence of other disorders -- such as intellectual disabilities, developmental disabilities, or obsessive-compulsive disorder -- as the cause of the odd eating behavior. This pattern of behavior must last at least one month for a diagnosis of pica to be made."", 'How Is Pica Treated? Given the risk of medical complications (such as lead poisoning) associated with pica, close medical monitoring is necessary throughout the treatment of the eating behavior. Additionally, close collaboration with a mental health team skilled in treating pica is ideal for optimal treatment of these complex cases. The Handbook for Clinical Child Psychology currently supports general behavioral strategies as the most effective treatment approach for pica, with training in which foods are edible and which foods cannot be eaten through the use of positive reinforcement.', ""What Complications Are Associated With Pica? There are many potential complications of pica, such as: Certain items, such as paint chips, may contain lead or other toxic substances and eating them can lead to poisoning, increasing the child's risk of complications including learning disabilities and brain damage . This is the most concerning and potentially lethal side effect of pica Eating non-food objects can interfere with eating healthy food, which can lead to nutritional deficiencies. Eating objects that cannot be digested, such as stones, can cause constipation or blockages in the digestive tract, including the intestines and bowels. Also, hard or sharp objects (such as paperclips or metal scraps) can cause tears in the lining of the esophagus or intestines. Bacteria or parasites from dirt or other objects can cause serious infections. Some infections can damage the kidneys or liver . Co-existing developmental disabilities can make treatment difficult."", 'What Is the Outlook for People With Pica? Pica usually begins in childhood and typically lasts for just a few months. However, it is likely to be more difficult to manage in children who are developmentally disabled.', 'Can Pica Be Prevented? There is no specific way to prevent pica. However, careful attention to eating habits and close supervision of children known to put things in their mouths may help catch the disorder before complications can occur.']"
5,What Is Pelvic Inflammatory Disease?,"['Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an infection of the organs of a women’s reproductive system. They include the uterus, ovaries, fallopian tubes, and cervix. It’s usually caused by a sexually transmitted infection (STI), like chlamydia or gonorrhea. PID can cause pain in your lower belly and hurt your ability to have a baby if it’s not treated properly. About 770,000 women in the United States are diagnosed with PID each year.', 'What Are the Symptoms of PID? You might not notice any symptoms of PID early on. But as the infection gets worse, you can have: Pain in your lower belly and pelvis Heavy discharge from your vagina with an unpleasant odor More bleeding than usual during your period Bleeding between periods Pain during sex Fever and chills Pain when you pee or a hard time going Throwing up, or feeling like you’re going to throw up Call your doctor right away if you have any of these symptoms. Some can also be signs of other conditions, so your doctor will most likely run some tests to figure out whether you have PID or something else.', 'PID can cause serious problems if it’s not treated. For example, you might have trouble getting pregnant or have pain in your pelvic area that doesn’t go away. In some cases, PID can bring on more intense symptoms, and you’ll need to go to the emergency room. Get medical help right away if you have: Severe pain in your lower belly Signs of shock, like fainting Vomiting Fever higher than 101 F Some of these also can be signs of other serious medical conditions, like appendicitis or an ectopic pregnancy (a pregnancy that happens outside the womb). You would need medical help right away for these as well.', 'Signs of an STI Treating a STI right away can help keep you from getting PID. Symptoms of STI are a lot like those of PID. They include heavy discharge from your vagina with an unpleasant odor, pain when you pee, and bleeding between periods. Call your doctor as soon as you notice any of these to lower your chances of PID.', 'How Is PID Diagnosed? When you visit your doctor, they’ll probably give you a pelvic examination. They’ll check for signs of tenderness in your cervix, uterus, or surrounding organs (ovaries and fallopian tubes). They’ll also: Look for signs of any fluid in the vagina or cervix that doesn’t look right Ask about your symptoms and your medical and sexual history Take your temperature Your doctor may check fluid samples under a microscope and send cultures for gonorrhea and chlamydia to the lab. They might also recommend some tests including: A blood test to check for sexually transmitted infection An ultrasound to make a picture of your internal organs If the exam or your tests show a high suspicion for PID, your doctor will talk to you about what treatment you need to get rid of it.', 'Should You Tell Your Partner? If your doctor diagnoses PID, you should tell anyone you’ve had sex with in the past 60 days about your illness. If it’s been longer than 60 days since you’ve had sex , tell your most recent partner, who should also get treated. You should not have sex while you’re undergoing treatment for PID, and neither should your partner.', 'How Is PID Treated? If you have PID, your doctor will most likely treat you with antibiotics, but sometimes you may need to be admitted to the hospital. Several different types of antibiotics have been found to work against the illness, and you may be given several types to take together. You’ll most likely be taking antibiotics for 2 weeks. You should always follow the directions and take all of them, even if you feel better. Your symptoms should improve within 3 days. If they don’t, you should go back to your doctor , because you may need to try something else. In more serious cases, your treatment may include a stay in the hospital. There may be several reasons for this: You’ve been taking antibiotics and your symptoms aren’t improving. Your doctor might ask you to take more tests to figure out why. You need to take antibiotics with an IV. If you’re not able to keep pills down, for instance, your doctor will want you to get antibiotics directly into your body with intravenous fluids. You’ve developed what’s called a “tubo-ovarian abscess .” This happens when part of an ovary or fallopian tube fills with infected fluid that needs to be drained. IV antibiotics are usually given first to see if they’ll clear up the infection. You are sick to your stomach, vomiting, or running a high fever. Your doctor might not be able to rule out another abdominal problem, such as appendicitis.']"
6,What Is the Placebo Effect?,"['A placebo is anything that seems to be a ""real"" medical treatment -- but isn\'t. It could be a pill, a shot, or some other type of ""fake"" treatment. What all placebos have in common is that they do not contain an active substance meant to affect health.', 'How Are Placebos Used? Researchers use placebos during studies to help them understand what effect a new drug or some other treatment might have on a particular condition. For instance, some people in a study might be given a new drug to lower cholesterol. Others would get a placebo. None of the people in the study will know if they got the real treatment or the placebo. Researchers then compare the effects of the drug and the placebo on the people in the study. That way, they can determine the effectiveness of the new drug and check for side effects.', 'What Is the Placebo Effect? Sometimes a person can have a response to a placebo. The response can be positive or negative. For instance, the person\'s symptoms may improve. Or the person may have what appears to be side effects from the treatment. These responses are known as the ""placebo effect.""', ""There are some conditions in which a placebo can produce results even when people know they are taking a placebo. Studies show that placebos can have an effect on conditions such as: Depression Pain Sleep disorders Irritable bowel syndrome Menopause In one study involving asthma, people using a placebo inhaler did no better on breathing tests than sitting and doing nothing. But when researchers asked for people's perception of how they felt, the placebo inhaler was reported as being as effective as medicine in providing relief."", ""How Does the Placebo Effect Work? Research on the placebo effect has focused on the relationship of mind and body. One of the most common theories is that the placebo effect is due to a person's expectations. If a person expects a pill to do something, then it's possible that the body's own chemistry can cause effects similar to what a medication might have caused."", 'For instance, in one study, people were given a placebo and told it was a stimulant. After taking the pill, their pulse rate sped up, their blood pressure increased, and their reaction speeds improved. When people were given the same pill and told it was to help them get to sleep , they experienced the opposite effects.', ""Experts also say that there is a relationship between how strongly a person expects to have results and whether or not results occur. The stronger the feeling, the more likely it is that a person will experience positive effects. There may be a profound effect due to the interaction between a patient and healthcare provider. The same appears to be true for negative effects. If people expect to have side effects such as headaches , nausea , or drowsiness, there is a greater chance of those reactions happening. The fact that the placebo effect is tied to expectations doesn't make it imaginary or fake. Some studies show that there are actual physical changes that occur with the placebo effect. For instance, some studies have documented an increase in the body's production of endorphins, one of the body's natural pain relievers. One problem with the placebo effect is that it can be difficult to distinguish from the actual effects of a real drug during a study. Finding ways to distinguish between the placebo effect and the effect of treatment may help improve the treatment and lower the cost of drug testing. And more study may also lead to ways to use the power of the placebo effect in treating disease.""]"
7,Plaque and Your Teeth,"['Plaque is the sticky, colorless film of bacteria that forms on teeth. It makes teeth ""feel fuzzy"" to the tongue and is most noticeable when teeth are not brushed. Plaque buildup can lead to gum disease and gingivitis. (Photo Credit: Kingfisher Productions / Getty Images) A growing body of research also finds that bacteria and inflammation in your mouth are linked to other problems, including heart attack and dementia, and may jeopardize your overall health.', 'What Causes Plaque and Why Is It Harmful? Plaque develops when foods containing carbohydrates (sugars and starches), such as milk, soft drinks, raisins, cakes, or candy are frequently left on the teeth. Bacteria that live in the mouth thrive on these foods, producing acids as a result. Over a period of time, these acids destroy tooth enamel, resulting in tooth decay. Plaque can also develop on the tooth roots under the gum and cause breakdown of the bone supporting the tooth. Plaque buildup can also lead to gum disease: first gingivitis, the tender and swollen gums that sometimes bleed. Over time, severe periodontal (gum) disease can develop. Gum tissue pulls away from the teeth, allowing the bacteria to destroy the underlying bone supporting the teeth.', ""Periodontal and Other Diseases Scientists have found links between periodontal disease and a number of other problems, including: Heart disease Diabetes Dementia Rheumatoid arthritis Premature birth What's behind the links? Experts can't say for certain, but they believe that oral bacteria can escape into the bloodstream and injure major organs. Inflammation is probably a common factor, experts say. Periodontal disease, marked by inflammation, may boost inflammation throughout the body. Inflammation, in turn, is an underlying problem in diseases including heart disease and rheumatoid arthritis."", 'Gum Disease and Heart Disease Over the years, many studies have found that people with gum disease are more likely to also have poor heart health, including heart attacks. A 2009 paper on the relationship between heart disease and gum disease was issued by the American Academy of Periodontology and The American Journal of Cardiology . Its joint recommendations encourage cardiologists to ask their patients about any gum disease problems. In addition, periodontists are encouraged to ask their patients about any family history of heart disease as well as their own heart health .', 'Gum Disease and Diabetes If you have diabetes, you are more likely to have gum disease. Why? Again, inflammation may be partly to blame. And those with diabetes are more likely to get infections, including gum disease. If your diabetes is not under control, you are at even higher risk of gum disease.', 'Gum Disease and Dementia Gum disease has also been found to raise the risk of dementia later in life. Other researchers have found that periodontal problems may also be linked with milder cognitive impairment, such as memory problems that make activities of daily life more difficult. In one study, people who had the worst gum disease scored the worst on memory tests and calculations.', ""Periodontal Disease and RA Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) is an autoimmune disease marked by inflammation and painful joints. People with RA are more likely to have periodontal disease, and one study found that they had more missing teeth than people who don't have RA. Chronic inflammation is common to both conditions. Although scientists haven't found evidence that one condition causes the other, a 2009 study found that people with a severe form of RA had less pain, swelling, and morning stiffness after their periodontal disease was treated."", 'Gum Disease and Premature Birth Studies on the link between periodontal disease and preterm birth have had conflicting results. Some show that women with gum disease are more likely to deliver a baby before term, which sets up the baby for health risks. Others have not found a link. Studies are ongoing. Other research has found that treating periodontal disease in pregnant women helps them carry their infants to term. One study showed that women with periodontal disease who completed treatment before the 35th week were less likely than those who did not get treatment to deliver their babies early.', 'Plaque Prevention To prevent plaque buildup, brush your teeth at least twice a day with a soft, rounded-tip bristled toothbrush. Pay particular attention to the space where the gums and teeth meet. Use a fluoride-containing toothpaste. How to brush your teeth. Hold your toothbrush at a 45-degree angle to your gums while you brush. Use gentle, circular strokes about a tooth wide. Cover your whole mouth -- outer and inner surfaces, and tops of your teeth. Make sure to brush your tongue to scrape away bacteria and freshen your breath as well. Spend 2 full minutes on brushing.', 'You should also floss between teeth at least once a day to remove food particles and bacteria. Some of the best dental floss options include: Dental picks Pre-threaded flossers Small, straight brushes that fit between your teeth Water flossers Wooden plaque removers Use an antibacterial mouth rinse to reduce bacteria that cause plaque and gum disease. See your dentist or oral hygienist every 6 months for a checkup and teeth cleaning. Ask your dentist if a dental sealant is appropriate for you. Dental sealants are a thin, plastic coating that are painted on the chewing surfaces of teeth to protect them from cavities and decay. Eat a balanced diet and limit the number of between-meal snacks. If you need a snack, choose nutritious foods such as plain yogurt, cheese, fruit, or raw vegetables. Vegetables, such as celery, help remove food and help saliva neutralize plaque-causing acids. Sugary foods and acidic foods cause decay. Eat them sparingly, and you’ll avoid problems. The worst offenders include: Starchy foods like potato chips and breads Sticky candies that cling to your teeth Carbonated soft drinks Alcohol', 'When you do treat yourself to one of these, drink plenty of water afterward to wash away bits of food and keep your mouth moist . Try not to snack between meals, and brush after you eat to keep your whites pearly. If you aren’t near your toothbrush after a meal, chew sugarless gum.']"
8,Understanding Anemia -- Diagnosis and Treatment,"[""How Do I Know if I Have Anemia? To diagnose anemia, your doctor will likely ask you about your medical history, perform a physical exam , and order blood tests. You can help by providing detailed answers about your symptoms, family medical history, diet, medications you take, alcohol intake, and ethnic background. Your doctor will look for symptoms of anemia and other physical clues that might point to a cause. There are basically three different causes of anemia : blood loss, decreased or faulty red blood cell production, or destruction of red blood cells . Blood tests will not only confirm the diagnosis of anemia , but also help point to the underlying condition. Tests might include: Complete blood count (CBC), which determines the number, size, volume, and hemoglobin content of red blood cells Blood iron level and your serum ferritin level, the best indicators of your body's total iron stores Levels of vitamin B12 and folate, vitamins necessary for red blood cell production Special blood tests to detect rare causes of anemia, such as an immune attack on your red blood cells, red blood cell fragility, and defects of enzymes, hemoglobin, and clotting Reticulocyte count , bilirubin , and other blood and urine tests to determine how quickly your blood cells are being made or if you have a hemolytic anemia , where your red blood cells have a shortened life span Only in rare cases will a doctor need to remove a sample of bone marrow to determine the cause of your anemia."", 'What Are the Treatments for Anemia? Your doctor may not treat your anemia until the underlying cause has been established. The treatment for one type of anemia may be both inappropriate and dangerous for another type of anemia. Anemia Caused by Blood Loss If you suddenly lose a large volume of blood, you may be treated with fluids, a blood transfusion, oxygen, and possibly iron to help your body build new red blood cells. Chronic blood loss is treated by identifying the source of bleeding, stopping the bleeding, and, if necessary, providing treatment for iron-deficiency anemia. Anemia Caused by Decreased Red Blood Cell Production The type of treatment you receive depends on the cause of decreased red blood cell production.', 'Anemia Caused by Iron Deficiency Without adequate iron, the body is unable to produce normal red blood cells. In young women, iron deficiency anemia can result from heavy menstrual bleeding. Non-menstruating women or men who develop iron deficiency need to have a colon exam ( colonoscopy or barium enema ) to help identify the source of chronic bleeding.', 'With iron deficiency anemia, your doctor will probably recommend iron supplements that contain the ferrous form of iron. Timed-release iron supplements are not a good choice for most people, because iron is primarily absorbed in the upper part of the digestive tract. If you use iron supplements, remember the following cautions: Always consult with your doctor before taking iron supplements. Excess iron intake can be harmful. Symptoms of iron overload include fatigue , vomiting , diarrhea , headache, irritability, heart disease , and joint problems. Iron supplements -- like all supplements and any medication -- should be kept out of the reach of children. Iron poisoning is one of the most common causes of accidental poisoning in young children. It can prove fatal in a matter of hours. Symptoms of poisoning in a child include dizziness , confusion, nausea, vomiting , and diarrhea . Seek medical help immediately. Watch for side effects. You may need to continue taking iron supplements for up to one year. Taking iron supplements with food can help prevent common side effects, which may include nausea, diarrhea, constipation , and stomach pain . Let your doctor know if you continue to have side effects. Different formulations are available. Watch for drug interactions . Tell your doctor if you are being treated for another condition. For example, calcium supplements interfere with iron absorption, so it is best to take them at different times of the day. The body absorbs iron best when taken in a mildly acidic medium, so your doctor may suggest taking iron with a half-glass of orange juice or with vitamin C . Your doctor may also recommend that you increase the amount of iron in your diet. Good dietary sources of iron include red meat, beans, egg yolk, whole-grain products, nuts, and seafood. Many processed foods and milk are also reinforced with iron.', ""Your doctor will monitor your red blood cell counts, including hematocrit, hemoglobin, and ferritin levels, during treatment. If your anemia doesn't improve with iron supplements, your doctor will look for some other underlying cause. In rare cases, your doctor may prescribe iron injections or give you iron intravenously (through a needle in the vein). In extremely rare cases of life-threatening iron-deficiency anemia, treatment may involve a blood transfusion. Anemia Caused By Vitamin B12 and Folate Deficiency Treatment depends on the cause of the deficiency. If your body stores are depleted of vitamin B12 , your doctor will most likely prescribe vitamin B12 injections. Vitamin B12 can also be given by mouth , but very high doses are needed. Vitamin B12 can also been given under the tongue or in a nasal spray, but these preparations are expensive and have not been adequately studied to be recommended. There is a good chance that many of the symptoms of deficiency will improve once the body is provided with the needed B12."", 'Some people with vitamin B12 deficiency have a permanent inability to absorb vitamin B12 and will need injections every one to three months or pills daily for the rest of their lives. Some forms of gastric bypass surgery are associated with deficiencies of iron, vitamin B12, and other nutrients typically absorbed in the part of the stomach that is bypassed. Your doctor may also recommend that you increase the amount of vitamin B12 in your diet. Good dietary sources of vitamin B12 are meat, liver , and kidney ; fish, oysters, and clams; and milk, cheese, and eggs. If you have a folate deficiency (which is rare), your doctor will prescribe folic acid supplements (folic acid is a form of folate used in dietary supplements and fortified foods.) They may recommend you to increase the amount of folate in your diet. Good dietary sources of folate include fresh fruits, green leafy vegetables, and cruciferous vegetables (cauliflower, broccoli, and Brussels sprouts); dairy products; and whole grain cereals. Vegetables should be eaten raw or lightly cooked. Anemia Caused by Problems of the Bone Marrow and Stem Cells .', 'This anemia tends to be more persistent and difficult to treat . The treatments for hereditary anemias, such as thalassemia or sickle cell disease , vary widely and depend on the specific condition and the severity of symptoms. Some anemias will not require any treatment, while others may require repeated transfusions and other aggressive measures. Although aplastic anemia will occasionally go into spontaneous remission, some people with this disorder require bone marrow transplantation. Anemia Caused by Chronic Disease It is best to treat the underlying condition whenever possible. Anemia caused by chronic kidney disease or following chemotherapy can often be treated with an injection of recombinant human erythropoietin called darbepoetin alfa ( Aranesp ).or epoetin alpha ( Epogen , Procrit ). Erythropoietin is a hormone that stimulates the production of red blood cells in the bone marrow. Darbepoetin alfa is a synthetic form of erythropoietin. Anemia Caused by Increased Red Blood Cell Destruction The treatment of hemolytic anemia will be tailored to the underlying cause. Mild cases of hemolytic anemia may not require any treatment at all. If an offending environmental agent can be identified -- a chemical, for example -- exposure to this agent should stop immediately. Other people with hemolytic anemia may need surgery to replace faulty heart valves, remove a tumor, or repair abnormal blood vessels.', ""Supportive treatment -- like intravenous fluids and pain medication -- will often be given. A blood transfusion may be necessary in some cases. Steroids can halt the body's immune attack on its own red blood cells. Certain damaging factors can be removed from the blood by a treatment called plasmapheresis . If hemolytic anemia persists despite treatment, your doctor may recommend splenectomy -- surgical removal of the spleen -- as a last resort. Most people can lead a normal life without their spleen. Longstanding hemolytic anemia can cause gallstones to develop from the by-products of red blood cell destruction. Gallbladder surgery may be necessary for symptomatic gallstones. A type of hemolytic anemia that occurs more commonly in children is associated with kidney damage, and dialysis may be necessary. In extremely rare cases, bone marrow transplantation may be the only solution for certain types of hemolytic anemia."", ""Sickle Cell Anemia Occasionally, children with sickle cell disease who have an appropriate donor may be cured by a bone marrow transplant . Alternatively, a drug called hydroxyurea ( Droxia , Hydrea , Silkos ) appears to stimulate the formation of an alternate form of hemoglobin that isn't susceptible to the sickling, and may be used to reduce the frequency of bone pain. The bone pain can usually be eased with pain medications and the anemia may require transfusions.\xa0Hydroxyurea may also decrease the need for blood transfusions. Lead poisoning is treated by discontinuing exposure to lead and administering a drug that binds and draws lead out of the body."", 'How Can I Prevent Anemia? You can help prevent iron-deficiency anemia by eating a well-balanced diet that includes good sources of iron, vitamin B12, and folate. Steps to take include the following: If you are a vegetarian or vegan , talk to your doctor or a nutritionist about your diet and any possible need for supplements. Ask your doctor or nutritionist if you should take vitamin C. Vitamin C makes the stomach more acidic and may improve the absorption of iron in your diet. Decrease your consumption of caffeinated products and tea. These substances can decrease iron absorption. Other offenders include fiber, large amounts of calcium , and the phytates found in some vegetables. Select iron-fortified cereals and breads. Carefully follow safety guidelines if your occupation involves work with lead-containing materials such as batteries, petroleum, and paint. Ask your doctor or local public health authorities about getting your dishes and other eating utensils tested for lead.']"
9,Anatomy and Circulation of the Heart,"['Your heart is an amazing organ. It continuously pumps oxygen and nutrient-rich blood throughout your body to sustain life. This fist-sized powerhouse beats (expands and contracts) 100,000 times per day, pumping 5 or 6 quarts of blood each minute, or about 2,000 gallons per day. Your heart is made of muscle. When the strong muscular walls contract (squeeze), it pumps blood to the arteries.   Photo Credit: WebMD', ""How Does the Heart Work? As the heart beats, it pumps blood through a system of blood vessels, called the circulatory system. The vessels are elastic tubes that carry blood to every part of the body. Blood is essential. In addition to carrying fresh oxygen from the lungs and nutrients to your body's tissues, it also takes the body's waste products, including carbon dioxide, away from the tissues. This is necessary to sustain life and promote the health of all the body's tissues. There are three main types of blood vessels: Arteries. They begin with the aorta, the large artery leaving the heart. Arteries carry oxygen-rich blood away from the heart to all of the body's tissues. They branch several times, becoming smaller and smaller as they carry blood farther from the heart. Capillaries. These are small, thin blood vessels that connect the arteries and the veins. Their thin walls allow oxygen, nutrients, carbon dioxide, and other waste products to pass to and from our organ's cells. Veins. These are blood vessels that take blood back to the heart; this blood lacks oxygen (oxygen-poor) and is rich in waste products that are to be excreted or removed from the body. Veins become larger and larger as they get closer to the heart. The superior vena cava is the large vein that brings blood from the head and arms to the heart, and the inferior vena cava brings blood from the abdomen and legs into the heart. Blood flows continuously through your body's blood vessels . Your heart is the pump that makes it all possible."", 'Where Is Your Heart? The heart is under the rib cage, to the left of your breastbone (sternum) and between your lungs. Looking at the outside of the heart, you can see that the heart is made of muscle. The strong muscular walls contract (squeeze), pumping blood to the arteries. The major blood vessels connected to your heart are the aorta, the superior vena cava, the inferior vena cava, the pulmonary artery (which takes oxygen-poor blood from the heart to the lungs where it is oxygenated), the pulmonary veins (which bring oxygen-rich blood from the lungs to the heart), and the coronary arteries (which supply blood to the heart muscle).', 'On the inside, the heart is a four-chambered, hollow organ. It is divided into the left and right side by a wall called the septum. The right and left sides of the heart are further divided into two top chambers called the atria, which receive blood from the veins, and two bottom chambers called ventricles, which pump blood into the arteries.', 'The atria and ventricles work together, contracting and relaxing to pump blood out of the heart. As blood leaves each chamber of the heart, it passes through a valve. There are four heart valves within the heart: Mitral valve Tricuspid valve Aortic valve Pulmonic valve (also called pulmonary valve) The tricuspid and mitral valves lie between the atria and ventricles. The aortic and pulmonic valves lie between the ventricles and the major blood vessels leaving the heart. The heart valves work the same way as one-way valves in the plumbing of your home. They prevent blood from flowing in the wrong direction. Each valve has a set of flaps, called leaflets or cusps. The mitral valve has two leaflets; the others have three. The leaflets are attached to and supported by a ring of tough, fibrous tissue called the annulus . The annulus helps to maintain the proper shape of the valve. The leaflets of the mitral and tricuspid valves are also supported by tough, fibrous strings called chordae tendineae. These are similar to the strings supporting a parachute. They extend from the valve leaflets to small muscles, called papillary muscles, which are part of the inside walls of the ventricles.', 'How Does Blood Flow Through the Heart? The right and left sides of the heart work together. The pattern described below is repeated over and over, causing blood to flow continuously to the heart, lungs, and body. Right side of the heart Blood enters the heart through two large veins, the inferior and superior vena cava, emptying oxygen-poor blood from the body into the right atrium. As the atrium contracts, blood flows from your right atrium into your right ventricle through the open tricuspid valve. When the ventricle is full, the tricuspid valve shuts. This prevents blood from flowing backward into the atria while the ventricle contracts. As the ventricle contracts, blood leaves the heart through the pulmonic valve, into the pulmonary artery, and to the lungs where it is oxygenated. Left side of the heart The pulmonary vein empties oxygen-rich blood from the lungs into the left atrium. As the atrium contracts, blood flows from your left atrium into your left ventricle through the open mitral valve . When the ventricle is full, the mitral valve shuts. This prevents blood from flowing backward into the atrium while the ventricle contracts. As the ventricle contracts, blood leaves the heart through the aortic valve, into the aorta, and to the body.', 'How Does Blood Flow Through Your Lungs? Once blood travels through the pulmonic valve, it enters your lungs. This is called the pulmonary circulation. From your pulmonic valve, blood travels to the pulmonary artery to tiny capillary vessels in the lungs. Here, oxygen travels from the tiny air sacs in the lungs, through the walls of the capillaries, into the blood. At the same time, carbon dioxide, a waste product of metabolism , passes from the blood into the air sacs. Carbon dioxide leaves the body when you exhale. Once the blood is purified and oxygenated, it travels back to the left atrium through the pulmonary veins.', 'What Are the Coronary Arteries? Like all organs, your heart is made of tissue that requires a supply of oxygen and nutrients. Although its chambers are full of blood, the heart receives no nourishment from this blood. The heart receives its own supply of blood from a network of arteries, called the coronary arteries. Two major coronary arteries branch off from the aorta near the point where the aorta and the left ventricle meet: The right coronary artery supplies the right atrium and right ventricle with blood. It usually branches into the posterior descending artery, which supplies the bottom portion of the left ventricle and back of the septum with blood. The left main coronary artery branches into the circumflex artery and the left anterior descending artery. The circumflex artery supplies blood to the left atrium, side, and back of the left ventricle, and the left anterior descending artery supplies the front and bottom of the left ventricle and the front of the septum with blood.', ""These arteries and their branches supply all parts of the heart muscle with blood. When the coronary arteries narrow to the point that blood flow to the heart muscle is limited ( coronary artery disease ), a network of tiny blood vessels in the heart that aren't usually open called collateral vessels may enlarge and become active. This allows blood to flow around the blocked artery to the heart muscle, protecting the heart tissue from injury."", ""How Does the Heart Beat? The atria and ventricles work together, alternately contracting and relaxing to make the heart beat and pump blood. The electrical system of your heart is the power source that makes this possible. Your heartbeat is triggered by electrical impulses that travel down a special pathway through your heart. The impulse starts in a small bundle of specialized cells called the SA node (sinoatrial node), in the right atrium. This node is known as the heart's natural pacemaker . The electrical activity spreads through the walls of the atria and causes them to contract. A cluster of cells in the center of the heart between the atria and ventricles, the AV node (atrioventricular node) is like a gate that slows the electrical signal before it enters the ventricles. This delay gives the atria time to contract before the ventricles do. The His-Purkinje network is a pathway of fibers that sends the impulse to the muscular walls of the ventricles, causing them to contract."", 'At rest, a normal heart beats around 50 to 99 times a minute in an adult. Exercise , emotions, fever, and some medications can cause your heart to beat faster, sometimes to well over 100 beats per minute.']"
10,Healthy Lungs vs. Smokers’ Lungs: What You Need to Know,"['You’ve heard it a million times: Smoking is bad for you. You may not realize, though, how much tobacco changes your lungs and their ability to bring oxygen into your body. The damage becomes clear when you look at the differences between healthy lungs and those of a smoker. Lungs are a pair of spongy, air-filled organs in the chest cavity that bring oxygen into the body and remove carbon dioxide from it. Photo Credit: WebMD', 'When Lungs Are Healthy Healthy lungs look and feel like sponges. They’re pink, squishy, and flexible enough to squeeze and expand with each breath. Their main job is to take oxygen out of the air you breathe and pass it into your blood. When you inhale, air enters your body through your windpipe, or trachea, the tube that connects your mouth and nose with your lungs. The air then travels through bronchial tubes, which move air in and out of your lungs . All along your airways, mucus and hair-like structures called cilia get rid of dust and dirt that come in with the air. Air keeps moving through your airways until it reaches tiny balloon-like air sacs in your lungs, called alveoli. From there, the oxygen moves into your blood. When you exhale, your lungs remove carbon dioxide from your blood in a process called gas exchange. Smoking throws this entire process out of balance.', 'How Smoking Changes Your Lungs A single puff of cigarette smoke has more than 7,000 chemicals, and almost 70 of them are known to cause cancer. When you breathe it in, these toxins go deep into your lungs and inflame them. Your airways start to make too much mucus. That leads to problems like coughing, bronchitis, and pneumonia . Toxins make the tiny airways in your lungs swell. This can make your chest feel tight and can cause wheezing and shortness of breath. If you continue smoking, the inflammation can build into scar tissue, which makes it harder to breathe. Sticky tar from tobacco builds up inside your lungs too. After years of smoking, it can give them a black color. The nicotine in cigarette smoke temporarily paralyzes and kills cilia. That means your airways can’t filter the dust and dirt in the air you breathe. It also makes you more likely to get colds and other respiratory infections. Smoking also damages the alveoli, the tiny air sacs that bring oxygen into your body. Once they’re destroyed, they don’t grow back. When you lose too many of them you’ll have emphysema , a lung condition that causes severe shortness of breath. With less oxygen coming into your body, and cigarette smoke bringing more carbon monoxide in, smoking puts all your vital organs at risk.', 'Will Quitting Smoking Help Your Lungs? The moment you stop smoking, your lungs begin to repair themselves. In fact, just 12 hours after you quit, the amount of carbon monoxide in your blood drops to a healthy level. More oxygen flows to your organs, and you’re able to breathe better. The cilia in your lungs become active again too. As they recover, you might cough more at first. But that’s a sign that the cilia are helping to clear extra mucus out of your lungs. Smoking isn’t an easy habit to break, but you’ll improve the way your lungs work if you quit. Talk to your health care provider about ways you can stop smoking.']"
11,Pleurisy (Pleuritis),"[""What Is Pleurisy? Pleurisy is a type of chest pain . It affects a part of your body called the pleura. The pleura are two thin, sheet-like layers of tissue. One covers your lungs. The other lines the inside of your chest wall. They fit snugly within your chest. There's a small amount of fluid in the space between the two layers (the pleural space). This helps the layers glide smoothly as you breathe. These layers keep your bare lungs from rubbing against the wall of your chest cavity every time you breathe in. When the pleurae are swollen and inflamed, they rub against each other in a painful way each time your lungs expand. When you inhale deeply, cough , sneeze ,\xa0or laugh, you’ll probably feel a sharp, stabbing pain in the area that’s affected. When you’re healthy, you never notice your pleura at work. But if your pleura has a problem, you’ll feel it. Most of the time, pleurisy happens because of an infection. If your doctor treats your infection, that can make it, and the pain, \xa0go away."", 'Pleurisy Causes Things that can cause pleurisy include: Lung infections. Bacterial infections such as\xa0pneumonia\xa0often cause pleurisy . It can also be caused by a virus such as the flu or by a fungus . A blood clot in your lung. A pulmonary embolism (PE) is a clot that blocks blood flow to your lungs. It can be life-threatening. Usually, the clot forms in a deep vein (like in your lower legs), breaks free, and travels to your lungs. Besides sudden pleuritic chest pain, you may have: Shortness of breath Fast breathing A rapid heart rate Coughing (with or without blood) Lightheadedness or fainting Sweating Anxiety or a feeling of dread See a doctor right away if you have these symptoms. Collapsed lung (pneumothorax). When air gets into the pleural space, the pressure can make your lung fully or partially collapse. The main symptoms are sudden chest pain and shortness of breath. In worse cases, you may have: Low oxygen levels Low blood pressure A fast heart rate Heart problems. A heart attack is one of the things doctors want to rule out when someone complains of chest pain. But often, a heart attack feels like pressure and moves down one of your arms or into your neck or jaw. You may also: Have nausea Sweat a lot Be short of breath', 'If you think you could be having a heart attack, call 911 right away. An autoimmune disease. These co nditions happen when your immune system attacks healthy body tissues by mistake. There are many different types. Rheumatoid arthritis and lupus are two common ones that can trigger pleuritic chest pain. Other symptoms include: Joint pain Tiredness A fever, facial rash, or dry eyes (for lupus) COVID-19. A few research papers and case reports have reported that pleuritic chest pain can be a symptom of COVID-19, the infection caused by the coronavirus. But much more research is needed. Other causes.

You're likely to notice these things: A sharp, stabbing pain that causes you to take small, shallow breaths because it’s worse when you try to breathe deeply Pain that spreads to your shoulder or back A cough Fever and chills"", 'Pleurisy Diagnosis Your doctor will ask you to describe the type of pain you feel when you breathe or cough , and they’ll ask whether it gets better or worse as the day goes on. They’ll listen to your lungs with a stethoscope to see if they’re making any strange noises. (Doctors often can hear the pleurae rubbing against each other.) You may also need to have tests, such as: Imaging. If your doctor wants to rule out other problems, they may send you for an X-ray, a CT scan , or an ultrasound . These images can show if pleurisy is causing your pain. Blood tests. These may show if an infection is the culprit. It may also reveal if you have an autoimmune disease like lupus or another problem. EKG . An electrocardiogram of your heart might show that your chest pain is caused by a heart problem, not pleurisy. Thoracentesis. A technician looks at a sample of your pleural fluid under a microscope for problems like infections or cancer. Thoracoscopy. Your doctor uses a thin, flexible tube called a thoracoscope to look inside your chest cavity.', 'Pleurisy Treatment In order to treat your pleurisy the right way, your doctor needs to know what’s causing it: If it’s bacteria , antibiotics can make you better. If it’s a fungus , they’ll probably give you an antifungal drug. If it’s a virus , you’ll get better on your own in a few days or weeks. Some people with pleurisy have too much fluid built up between their two layers of pleura. Your doctor may need to remove some of the fluid. They may insert a thin needle into the space between your pleura to do this. Painkillers and steroid medications can help while you’re getting better. If coughing hurts too much, your doctor might prescribe medication ( codeine ) that can make you cough less. You might feel better if you lie on the side that’s causing you pain. As the pain starts to go away, try to breathe more deeply and cough up any phlegm you have.', 'Pleurisy Complications Complications of pleurisy can be serious. They include: Lungs that are blocked or can’t expand the way they should (atelectasis) Pus in your pleural cavity (empyema) A sudden drop in blood flow (shock) A dangerous reaction to infection (sepsis) Inflammation can also make fluid build up in your pleural cavity. This is called pleural effusion. You might have less pain, but it can be hard for you to breathe. Your doctor might give you medications like diuretics, or you might have a procedure to drain the fluid.']"
12,Polycythemia Vera,"[""What Is Polycythemia Vera? Polycythemia vera (PV) is a blood cancer that begins in the marrow of your bones, the soft center where new blood cells grow. It causes your marrow to make too many red blood cells so your blood is too thick. You may be more likely to have clots, a stroke , or a heart attack . This disease gets worse slowly, usually over many years. It can be life-threatening if you don't get treatment, but the right care can help you live a long life. Most people who have PV don’t get diagnosed until they’re 60 or older, usually after a routine blood test. But it can happen at any age. Men get it more often than women. It's common to worry when you find out that you have cancer . Remember that everyone is different and that all cancers aren’t the same. With the support of your doctor, family, friends, and other people who have polycythemia vera, you’ll be in the best position to manage it."", '', 'Polycythemia Vera Causes Your bone marrow makes three types of blood cells : Red White Platelets Red blood cells carry oxygen, white ones fight infections, and platelets clot your blood to stop bleeding. Most people with polycythemia vera have too many red blood cells. But it can also cause you to have too many white blood cells and platelets. PV is caused by a gene (either JAK2 or TET2) that doesn’t work the way it should. Most likely, the problem happened over the course of your life. Rarely, parents can pass these faulty genes to children.', ""Polycythemia Vera Symptoms At first, you may not notice any problems.

This might mean PV has enlarged your spleen , an organ that helps filter your blood."", 'Polycythemia Vera Complications Blood clots can cause a heart attack, a stroke , or deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ). They might also make your liver or spleen larger. If your organs don’t get enough blood, you could have chest pain or heart failure . Having too many red blood cells might cause stomach ulcers , gout , or kidney stones . PV can also lead to more serious blood diseases like acute leukemia or myelofibrosis. Acute leukemia is a blood cancer that gets worse quickly. Myelofibrosis is a condition in which your bone marrow fills with scar tissue.', ""Polycythemia Vera Diagnosis Your doctor will start with a physical exam , including a check of your spleen. They’ll ask about your symptoms and see if your face is unusually red. You may have some blood tests, including: Complete blood count( CBC ). Your doctor takes a sample of your blood and sends it to a lab, where a machine counts the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. An unusually high number of any of these could be a sign of polycythemia vera. Blood smear. Your doctor looks at a sample of your blood through a microscope. It's a way to check for other diseases that are sometimes linked to PV. EPO level. This test measures how much of the hormone EPO is in your blood. EPO tells your bone marrow to make blood cells. People who have polycythemia vera have very low amounts of it."", ""You may also need a bone marrow biopsy . The results can show your doctor if your bone marrow makes too many blood cells. For this test, your doctor will take samples of your marrow, usually from the back of your hip bone . You lie down on a table and get a shot that will numb the area. Then, your doctor uses a needle to take out a small amount of bone marrow. It's an outpatient procedure, which means you don't have to stay overnight in a hospital. You can get it done in a clinic, a hospital, or your doctor's office. Questions for your doctor Before your appointment, it's a good idea to make a list of things to ask your doctor, such as: Which treatment do you recommend? What are the side effects? How can I prevent complications? Since I have polycythemia vera, am I more likely to have a stroke or heart attack? How can I ease my symptoms?"", ""Polycythemia Vera Treatment If you don't have many symptoms, you might not need treatment for PV right away. Your doctor will keep a close watch on you. If you do need treatment, it will be aimed at lowering the amount of red blood cells your body makes and preventing blood clots and other complications. Your options include: Phlebotomy . This is often the first treatment for people who have polycythemia vera. Your doctor takes blood from your vein so you have fewer blood cells. It's a lot like donating blood. After it's done, your blood will be thinner, and it’ll flow more easily. You'll usually feel better, too. Some symptoms will ease, like headaches or dizziness. Your doctor will decide how often you need phlebotomy. Some people with PV don’t need any other treatment for many years. Low-dose aspirin . This keeps platelets from sticking together. That makes you less likely to get blood clots, which in turn makes heart attacks or strokes less likely. Most people with polycythemia vera take low-dose aspirin."", ""Medicine to lower blood cells. If you need more help, your doctor may prescribe hydroxyurea ( Droxia , Hydrea ), a pill that lowers your red blood count and eases symptoms. Other drugs like interferon alfa ( Intron A) or ropeginterferon alfa-2b-njft ( Besremi )\xa0help\xa0your immune system cut back on making blood cells. You might take busulfan ( Busulfex , Myleran ) or ruxolitinib ( Jakafi ) if hydroxyurea isn’t helpful or if it causes severe side effects. If you have itching that doesn't go away, your doctor may give you antihistamines ."", ""Lifestyle Changes Keep yourself comfortable and as healthy as possible during treatment: Don't smoke or chew tobacco . Tobacco narrows blood vessels, which can make blood clots more likely. Get light exercise , such as walking, to help your circulation and keep your heart healthy. Do leg and ankle exercises to keep clots from forming in the veins of your legs. Your doctor or a physical therapist can show you how. Bathe or shower in cool water if warm water makes you itch. Keep your skin moist with lotion, and try not to scratch."", ""Polycythemia Vera Prognosis There's no cure, but the right treatment can help you manage this disease for many years. Talk to your friends and family about what you’re dealing with. You may also want to join a support group for people who’ve been in your position. The MPN Research Foundation has more information about polycythemia vera. It can also help you find support groups.""]"
13,Polymyalgia Rheumatica and Temporal Arteritis,"['Polymyalgia rheumatica is an infrequently occurring, inflammatory condition that causes pain or aching in the large muscle groups, especially around the shoulders and hips. Polymyalgia literally means ""many muscle pains."" Rheumatica means ""changing"" or ""in flux.""', 'What Are the Symptoms of Polymyalgia Rheumatica? Symptoms of polymyalgia rheumatica tend to develop quickly and in addition to muscle pain , other symptoms may include: Stiffness around the shoulders and hips, especially in the morning and after resting Weakness Fatigue Generally feeling ill Mild fevers (occasionally) Weight loss', 'What Is Temporal Arteritis? About 15% of people with polymyalgia rheumatica also have temporal arteritis and about half of people with temporal arteritis also have polymyalgia rheumatica. Temporal arteritis causes inflammation that damages large and medium-sized arteries . The name of the condition stems from the fact that some of the affected arteries provide blood to the head, including the temples. Temporal arteritis is also known as ""giant cell arteritis.""', ""What Are the Symptoms of Temporal Arteritis? Temporal arteritis has several symptoms, including: Severe headaches, the most common symptom Scalp tenderness Jaw or facial soreness, especially with chewing Vision changes or distorted vision that's caused by decreased blood flow to the eye Stroke\xa0(rare) Fatigue Fever Weight loss Night sweats Depression Feeling ill"", 'Who Gets Polymyalgia Rheumatica and Temporal Arteritis? Polymyalgia rheumatica and temporal arteritis frequently affect people over age 50. The average age of patients is 70. These diseases are more common among women, and Caucasians are more likely to get these diseases than other ethnic groups. The exact cause of these illnesses is unknown.', 'How Are Polymyalgia Rheumatica and Temporal Arteritis Diagnosed? Under the new criteria developed by the American College of Rheumatology and The European League Against Rheumatism, patients ages 50 years and older can be classified as having PMR if they meet the conditions below: Shoulder pain on both sides Morning stiffness that lasts at least 45 minutes High levels of inflammation measured by blood tests Reported new hip pain Absence of swelling in the small joints of the hands and feet, and absence of positive blood tests for rheumatoid arthritis The new classification criteria may also help to evaluate existing treatments for polymyalgia rheumatica.', ""Everyone with polymyalgia rheumatica is typically\xa0tested for temporal arteritis. This, too, would start with the exam and listening to the patient's symptoms. If temporal arteritis is suspected, but less convincing features are present, a temporal artery biopsy may confirm the diagnosis. The biopsy is taken from a part of the artery located in the hairline, in front of the ear. In most cases the biopsy is helpful, but in some individuals it may be negative or normal, even though the person does have temporal arteritis."", 'Can Other Problems Mimic Polymyalgia Rheumatica? Yes. Some other illnesses that may be confused with polymyalgia rheumatica include: Rheumatoid arthritis Infections Inflammation of blood vessels (vasculitis) Chemical and hormonal abnormalities A variety of muscle diseases Cancer', 'How Are Polymyalgia Rheumatica and Temporal Arteritis Treated? There is no known cure for polymyalgia rheumatica and temporal arteritis, but these diseases can be treated and controlled. Corticosteroids -- often called "" steroids "" -- help rapidly relieve the symptoms of both conditions. Treatment with steroids -- usually in the form of prednisone -- is mandatory for temporal arteritis to prevent serious complications, such as blindness. Low doses of steroids are often successful in treating polymyalgia rheumatica. Higher doses are often required to treat temporal arteritis. Steroids reduce the function of inflammatory cells that cause these illnesses. Consequently, steroids minimize tissue damage. Steroids also impair the immune system -- thus increasing the risk of infection. The decision to prescribe steroids is always made on an individual basis. Your doctor will consider your age, presence of other illnesses, and medications you are taking. Your doctor also will make sure you understand the potential benefits and risks of steroids before you start taking them.', 'You will have frequent blood tests while taking steroids or other medications to monitor for possible side effects and to evaluate the effectiveness of therapy. These blood tests can usually detect problems before you are aware of any symptoms. Your doctor will frequently evaluate your heart and lung function and blood sugar level, which may increase after you start taking steroids. While being treated for polymyalgia rheumatica or temporal arteritis, it is important to keep all appointments with your doctor and the lab, and have your blood pressure checked regularly.', 'Because the medicines used to treat polymyalgia and temporal arteritis increase your chance for developing infections, report symptoms such as a cough , fever, or shortness of breath to your doctor. Long-term steroid treatment (for a few months to several years) requires additional testing and monitoring. The long-term use of steroids can cause osteoporosis ( bone loss ), which can be detected with scans similar to X-rays. Taking supplements of calcium and vitamin D , sometimes along with prescription medication is recommended to prevent osteoporosis in people taking steroids. Discuss the potential side effects caused by your treatment with your doctor.', 'Temporal arteritis may also be treated with methotrexate or a biologic drug called tocilizumab (Actemra). Tocilizumab is given as an injection under the skin to decrease the amount of steroid a person needs. This medicine may be used along with steroids. Treatments work fairly quickly and have excellent results.', 'What Is the Long-Term Outlook for Polymyalgia Rheumatica and Temporal Arteritis? With careful monitoring and appropriate treatment, most patients with polymyalgia rheumatica or temporal arteritis have a normal life span and lifestyle. Most of the time, these diseases can be successfully controlled with steroids and other drugs (including tocilizumab, a rheumatoid arthritis drug which has been touted for people who have trouble with or do not respond to steroids). The success of treatment is related to prompt diagnosis, aggressive treatment, and careful follow-up to prevent or minimize side effects from the medications.']"
14,Colorectal Cancer,"['What Is Colorectal Cancer? Colorectal cancer, sometimes called colon cancer , starts when cells that line your colon or rectum grow out of control. It’s the third leading cause of cancer deaths among American men and women. In the U.S., about 72% of colorectal cancer cases start in the colon and 28% in the rectum. The colon is also called the large intestine, which is part of your digestive system . It absorbs water and nutrients from food after it moves through your stomach and small intestine. Solid waste ( poop or stool) is stored in your colon before moving to the rectum. This 8-inch tube holds the waste until it leaves your body through the anus . Most colorectal cancers are ""silent"" tumors. They grow slowly, and you may not notice any symptoms until they’re large. But you can take some steps to prevent colorectal cancer , and you can cure it if you find it early. It’s important to have regular screening exams to spot cancer or precancerous areas, especially if you have a high risk of getting it.', 'Types of Colorectal Cancer There are several types of colorectal cancer, based on where it starts. Adenocarcinoma . This is the most common kind, making up 96% of cases. It starts in cells that make mucus for your colon and rectum. Carcinoid tumor. This begins in cells that make hormones. Gastrointestinal stromal tumor. This forms in cells in the wall of your colon that tell your gastrointestinal muscles to move food or liquid along. Lymphoma . This is cancer of your immune system cells. Sarcoma . This starts in connective tissues like blood vessels or muscle layers.', 'Colorectal Cancer Causes Nearly all colon and rectal cancers begin as a polyp, a growth on the inner surface of your colon. Polyps themselves usually aren’t cancer. The most common types of polyps in your colon and rectum include: Hyperplastic and inflammatory polyps. These usually don’t carry a chance of cancer. But large hyperplastic polyps, especially on the right side of your colon, can be a problem. Your doctor will want to remove them. Adenomas or adenomatous polyps. These are precancerous. If you leave them alone, they could turn into colon cancer . Colorectal cancer may also start in an area of abnormal cells, called dysplasia, in the lining of your colon or rectum.', ""Colorectal Cancer Risk Factors Anyone can get colorectal cancer. It’s most common among African Americans and people over age 50. The lifetime chance of developing colorectal cancer is 1 in 22 for men and 1 in 24 for women. Things that can raise your chances of getting it include: A personal or family history of colorectal cancer or polyps A diet with a lot of red and processed meats Inflammatory bowel disease such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis Conditions passed down through your family, such as familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer ( HNPCC ) Obesity Smoking Lack of activity Heavy alcohol use Type 2 diabetes Breast cancer Ovarian or uterine cancer diagnosed before age 50 Polyps might be more likely to contain cancer or carry a higher chance of cancer if: They’re larger than 1 centimeter You have more than two They show signs of dysplasia"", 'Colorectal Cancer Symptoms You might not notice any signs of colorectal cancer . When you have them, they can include: A change in your bowel habits that doesn’t go away, such as constipation or diarrhea A feeling that your bowel hasn’t emptied all the way after you poop Bleeding from your rectum Blood on or in your poop Poop that’s narrower or thinner than usual Belly discomfort Stomach cramps Weight loss with no clear cause An unusually low number of red blood cells ( anemia ) Weakness or fatigue A lump in your belly or rectum', 'Colorectal Cancer Diagnosis Your doctor may give you a physical exam and feel your belly for any swollen organs or masses. They might also order one or more of these tests to spot polyps or colorectal cancer: Rectal exam. Your doctor can use their fingers to feel for growths. Colonoscopy. This is the standard screening test that experts recommend. Your doctor uses a thin, flexible tube called a colonoscope to look at your entire colon and rectum. Sigmoidoscopy . Your doctor looks at your rectum and the last part of your colon. Biopsy . Your doctor may take out a bit of tissue during a colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy and send it to a lab for testing. They can also use a needle to take a sample, with a CT scan or ultrasound to guide them. Complications are rare, but you may have some bleeding or discomfort. Stool DNA . This test looks for certain gene changes that might be a sign of colon cancer. CT colonography. This is a special X-ray (also called a virtual colonoscopy) of your entire colon. It takes less time and is less invasive than other tests. But if it shows a polyp, you’ll still need a colonoscopy. Barium enema X-ray. This is a type of X-ray that involves putting dye in your colon. It can find trouble spots that might mean you need a colonoscopy. Other imaging tests. MRI or ultrasound can give your doctor a better look at your organs.', 'Tumors may bleed in amounts so small that only special tests can find it. This is called occult bleeding, meaning you probably can’t see it with the naked eye. These tests can look for blood in your poop: Fecal immunochemical test (FIT). This reacts to part of human hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells. You can do the test at home and mail a sample of poop to a lab. Guaiac-based fecal occult blood tests (gFOBT) . This uses a chemical to look for blood. You can do it at home and mail in a card with a sample of poop on it. If either of these tests finds blood, your doctor will probably recommend a colonoscopy.', 'Colorectal Polyps If a test finds a polyp, your doctor will take it out and send it to a laboratory. A specialist will look at it under a microscope. Your doctor will discuss the results with you. They will recommend next steps, including when to have another colonoscopy.', 'Colorectal Cancer Stages If you have colorectal cancer, tests can tell your doctor whether it has grown or spread. This process is called staging. The stages of colorectal cancer are: Stage 0. The cancer hasn’t gone past the inner layer of your colon or rectum. This is also called cancer in situ. Stage I. The cancer has grown into the muscles of your colon or rectum. Stage IIA. It’s spread through the colon or rectum wall. Stage IIB. It’s grown into the lining of your abdomen (peritoneum). Stage IIC. The cancer has spread through your colon or rectum wall and into nearby tissues. Stage IIIA. It’s spread to three or fewer lymph nodes or to tissues around your colon or rectum. Stage IIIB. It’s grown through the wall of your bowel or into nearby organs. It’s also spread to three or fewer lymph nodes or to tissues around your colon or rectum. Stage IIIC. The cancer has spread to four or more lymph nodes. Stage IVA. Cancer has spread to one part of your body that’s farther away, like your liver or lungs . Stage IVB. It’s spread to more than one part of your body. Stage IVC. Cancer has grown in the lining of your abdomen and possibly to lymph nodes or organs that are farther away.', 'Colorectal Cancer Treatment Treatment will depend on several things. You and your doctor should consider: The stage of the disease How well certain treatments will work for you Your overall health The risks and side effects How much the treatment costs The option you’d prefer You might have one or more of these treatments: Surgery Your doctor can take out polyps and small tumors that haven’t spread during a colonoscopy or through a laparoscopy, in which they put special tools and cameras into your belly through small cuts. If the cancer has spread, you might have surgery to remove part of your colon (partial colectomy). If cancer has spread to your liver and nowhere else, surgery is your best chance for a cure. But it’s not an option for everyone. Your doctor must be able to take out all the cancer. And you need enough healthy tissue left over for your liver to still work. If your tumor is very large, you might have chemotherapy to help shrink it before surgery.', ""Procedures called ablation and embolization can also treat cancer that has spread to the liver. They can destroy tumors without removing them. Sometimes, doctors use high-energy radio waves or electromagnetic microwaves to kill cancer cells. Or they may inject the tumor with alcohol or freeze it with a metal probe. With embolization, a substance blocks blood flow to the tumor. Radiation therapy Radiation therapy uses high-energy X-rays, electron beams, or chemical agents called radioactive isotopes to attack cancer. The radiation is aimed directly at the tumor. It damages chromosomes in cancer cells so they can't multiply. External radiation therapy is the most common form for people with colorectal cancer. A machine aims a beam of radiation at your tumor. It's painless. Before treatment begins, a team of specialists, including a radiation oncologist, will use measurements from scans to find the exact spot to aim the radiation. They'll tattoo small dots on your body to show where to target the beam. This ensures that they get the same location at every treatment."", ""You'll need to be still during the procedure, but it lasts only a few minutes. You may have five treatments a week for several weeks, and sometimes, you'll be treated a few times a day for several weeks. There are many kinds of external beam radiation. These include 2D, 3D conformal, IMRT, IGRT, and proton beam therapy. Radiation can also be internal. Interstitial radiation therapy (also known as brachytherapy) uses a tube to place small pellets, or seeds, of radioactive material directly into your tumor. After 15 minutes, they're taken out. You may have up to two treatments a week for 2 weeks. Endocavitary radiation therapy is often used for rectal cancer . A device called a proctoscope is placed in your anus to carry radiation directly to the tumor. It stays there a few minutes and then is taken out. You'll probably have four treatments, each about 2 weeks apart. Side effects tend to be specific to the area of your body that gets the radiation. Talk to your doctor about what you can expect."", ""You may have: Blood in your stool Lack of energy Leaky bowels Pain and burning on your skin where beams were aimed Pain during bowel movements Pain when you pee Problems having sex Most side effects should get better a few weeks after treatment ends, but some may not go away. Medications and other treatments may help. Radiofrequency ablation This kills cancer cells using a probe with electrodes. Chemotherapy Chemo drugs destroy cancer cells or stop them from spreading. You can take the medicines in pill form or through an IV. You can also get them in a blood vessel close to your tumor. There are many types of these drugs. Some work better together, so you may take two or more at the same time. You usually get the treatment for 2 or 4 weeks and then take a break. You might have chemo after surgery to kill any cancer cells left behind. Or you could have it before an operation to make a tumor smaller and easier to remove. Chemo may help treat cancer pain too. And it's often the best way to slow the spread of the disease."", ""The downside is that the drugs can attack healthy cells as well as cancerous ones. This can cause side effects like hair loss, vomiting, and mouth sores. You may also feel very tired and get sick easily. But these problems usually get better when your treatment is over. Immunotherapy Immunotherapy , a type of biological therapy, uses your body's immune system to fight cancer. It includes: Biological response modifiers . These trigger the immune system to indirectly affect tumors. Biological response modifiers include cytokines (chemicals produced by cells to instruct other cells) such as interferons and interleukins. This strategy involves giving larger amounts of these substances by injection or infusion in the hope of stimulating the cells of the immune system to act more effectively. Colony-stimulating factors. These things signal your body to make bone marrow cells (the soft, sponge-like material inside bones), which include both red and white blood cells and platelets. White blood cells fight infection; red blood cells carry oxygen to and carbon dioxide from organs and tissues; platelets are cell fragments that help the blood clot. Often, other cancer treatments cause decreases in these cells. Thus, colony-stimulating factors don’t directly affect tumors, but they can help support your immune system during cancer treatment . Monoclonal antibodies . These lab-made things find and bind to cancer cells wherever they are in the body. They can be used to see where the tumor is in the body (detection of cancer) and call in other immune system cells to destroy them, or as therapy to deliver drugs, toxins, or radioactive material directly to a tumor. Monoclonal antibodies for colorectal cancer include bevacizumab ( Avastin ), cetuximab ( Erbitux ), panitumumab ( Vectibix ), and ramucirumab ( Cyramza ). Immune checkpoint inhibitors . These are drugs that take the “brakes” off of checkpoint proteins in the immune system, which helps these proteins recognize and attack cancer cells. They include ipilimumab ( Yervoy ), pembrolizumab , ( Keytruda ), and nivolumab ( Opdivo ). Tumor vaccines . Researchers are developing vaccines that may encourage the immune system to better recognize cancer cells. In theory, they would work in a similar way as vaccines for measles , mumps, and other infections. The difference in cancer treatment is that vaccines are used after someone has cancer, rather than to prevent the disease. There are also ongoing studies involving possible vaccines to prevent breast and prostate cancers."", 'Like other forms of cancer treatment, immunotherapy may have a number of side effects. They can vary widely from person to person. Biologic response modifiers may cause flu-like symptoms, including fever, chills, nausea , and loss of appetite. In addition, rashes or swelling may develop at the injection site, and blood pressure may fall. Fatigue is another common side effect. Colony-stimulating factors might cause bone pain , fatigue , fever, and loss of appetite. The side effects of monoclonal antibodies vary. They may include serious allergic reactions. Rashes are common and may be a severe side effect of Erbitux or Vectibix. They usually mean that these drugs are working. Bleeding, blood clotting, or bowel perforation may be side effects of Avastin or Cyramza. Vaccines can cause muscle aches and low-grade fever. Immune checkpoint inhibitors can have serious side effects. One concern is that they can allow the immune system to attack normal organs in the body. More common side effects include fatigue, cough, loss of appetite, and rash.', 'Targeted therapy This uses drugs that focus on specific things in cancer cells, like genes or proteins, to kill them or keep them from growing. Some come in pill form. You get others in your vein (IV) at a hospital, doctor’s office, or clinic. Most are given along with standard chemo medicines. Medications used as targeted therapies for colorectal cancer include: Aflibercept ( Zaltrap ) Bevacizumab ( Avastin ) Cetuximab ( Erbitux ) Panitumumab ( Vectibix ) Ramucirumab ( Cyramza ) Targeted therapies can cause serious side effects. Some of the most common are: Diarrhea Blood clots Bleeding in the GI tract Allergic reactions Liver diseases like hepatitis and skin rash or peeling Palliative (supportive) care This doesn’t try to cure cancer. Its goal is to help you feel better. It also provides support for your family and caregivers. And it can help you make decisions about the kind of care you want in the months and years ahead. Ask your doctor about palliative care as soon as you find out that you have cancer. Your care team can prescribe meds to ease pain and side effects. Palliative care can also ease depression and may help you live longer.', 'Colorectal Cancer Follow-Up Care After you’ve finished your treatments for colorectal cancer , follow-up care is very important. Regular checkups can help find any changes in your health, and if the cancer comes back (or “recurs”), it can be treated as soon as possible. Ongoing care You may need to see many different doctors during the months and years after you finish treatment . Your oncologist will usually start out as your main contact. They’ll give you a schedule for screenings and tests. They may ask your primary care doctor to take over your care at some point. Be sure you have a summary of your cancer treatment that includes: Your follow-up plan from your oncologist Names and doses of all your chemotherapy drugs or other medicines The dates and specifics of your diagnosis (including cancer stage and other details) Any side effects or complications of treatment Types and dates of all surgeries and locations where they were done Dates and amounts of radiation and where it was done Contact info for all of your doctors', ""Bring this summary with you for all your appointments, since you may not always see the same doctor. Ask your doctor any questions you may have about your day-to-day life, such as whether it would help to make changes in your diet or exercise habits. Tell them about any supplements you take, even “natural” products or vitamins and minerals. That way, your doctor can check on anything that might have side effects or interact with your medicines. If you feel down or anxious, tell your doctor that, too. They may be able to recommend a counselor or a support group. Follow-up tests What types of screenings you have and how often you get them will depend on the type and stage of cancer you had and the treatments you got. You'll probably need check-ups three to four times a year during the first 2 or 3 years after treatment and one or two times a year after that. These might include: A physical exam Colonoscopy, usually 6 months to 1 year after surgery. Your doctor can tell you how often you'll need one. CT scans of your chest, abdomen , and possibly pelvis every 6 to 12 months for the first 3 years CEA (carcinoembryonic antigen) blood test every 3 to 6 months for 5 years. High levels of CEA protein in the blood may mean cancer cells have spread."", ""When to call your doctor Call your doctor right away if you have: Belly pain , weight loss, or blood in your stool Fatigue that gets in the way of your daily life Problems with your bowel movements, bladder , or sexual function Mental changes like trouble concentrating, anxiety , depression , or memory loss Trouble sleeping Changes in your family medical history , like relatives who've recently been diagnosed with cancer"", 'Colorectal Cancer Prevention A healthy tobacco-free lifestyle is the first step in preventing cancer of any kind. Experts recommend that as an initial step toward the prevention of colorectal cancer, people should exercise and eat healthily. The American Cancer Society says adults should get 150 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes of high-intensity exercise (or a combination of these) each week. The National Cancer Institute recommends a low-fat, high-fiber diet that includes at least 2 1/2 cups of fruits and vegetables each day. Cut back on red meat and other high-fat foods, such as eggs and many dairy products. You can get the protein you need from low-fat dairy products (also a good source of calcium), nuts, beans, lentils, and soybean products. Avoid overcooking or barbecuing meats and fish.', 'Some experts suggest that aspirin may stop colorectal cancer cells from multiplying. In addition, other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, such as Aleve and Motrin) may reduce the size of polyps and, therefore, the risk of colon cancer. This theory has not been well established, and the proper dosage is unclear. Also, NSAIDs may raise your odds of serious complications, such as stomach bleeding, heart attacks, and strokes. If you’re at high risk of colon cancer, don’t start taking aspirin or other NSAIDs until you discuss it with your doctor. Women who have gone through menopause and who take hormone replacement therapy that includes both estrogen and progesterone may be less likely to get colon cancer. But if they do, it may be more advanced when it’s found. Hormone replacement therapy also raises the risk of other cancers. Talk with your doctor about the risks and benefits. Screening for colorectal cancer is crucial. The American Cancer Society and\xa0the US Preventive Services Task Force recommends that people get regular screening exams from ages 45 to 75 if they have an average chance of getting colorectal cancer. This means that you don’t have symptoms and that neither you nor a close family member has had colorectal polyps, cancer, or inflammatory bowel disease.', 'The guidelines include at least one of these tests: Tests for blood in your poop once a year Stool DNA tests every 3 years Flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years CT colonography (virtual colonoscopy) every 5 years Colonoscopy every 10 years Talk to your doctor if you have one or more of the colorectal cancer risk factors. You might need to start screenings at a younger age, get tested more often, or have specific kinds of tests. If you’re 76 through 85, talk to your doctor about whether you should be tested. The American Cancer Society doesn’t recommend testing for people older than 85.']"
15,Pompe Disease,"[""What Is Pompe Disease? If you or your child has Pompe disease , it's important to know that each case is different, and that doctors have treatments to help manage it. Pompe disease happens when your body can't make a protein that breaks down a complex sugar, called glycogen, for energy. Too much sugar builds up and damages your muscles and organs. Pompe disease causes muscle weakness and trouble breathing . It mostly affects the liver , heart , and muscles. You might hear Pompe disease called by other names such as GAA deficiency or type II glycogen storage disease (GSD). Although it can happen to anyone, it's more common in African-American people and some Asian groups."", 'Cause You get Pompe disease from your parents. To get it, you have to inherit two flawed genes, one from each parent. You can have one gene and not have symptoms of the disease.', 'Symptoms What symptoms you have, when they start, and how much trouble they are can be very different for different people.', ""A baby between a few months old and age 1 has early-onset, or infantile, Pompe disease. This could look like: Trouble eating and not gaining weight Poor head and neck control Rolling over and sitting up later than expected Breathing problems and lung infections Enlarged and thickening heart or heart defects Enlarged liver Enlarged tongue If you're older when symptoms start -- as late as an adult in your 60s -- it's known as late-onset Pompe disease. This type tends to move slowly, and it doesn't usually involve your heart. You might notice: Feeling weak in the legs, trunk, and arms Shortness of breath, a hard time exercising, and lung infections Trouble breathing while you sleep A big curve in your spine Enlarged liver Enlarged tongue that makes it hard to chew and swallow Stiff joints"", ""Getting a Diagnosis Many symptoms are similar to other medical conditions. To help figure out what's going on, your doctor may ask: Do you feel weak, fall often, or have trouble walking, running, climbing stairs, or standing up? Do you have a hard time breathing, especially at night or when you lie down? Do you get headaches in the morning? Are you often tired during the day? When you were a child, what kinds of health problems did you have? Does or did anyone else in your family have troubles like these, too?"", 'You may need to get tests, depending on what symptoms you have, to rule out other conditions. If your doctor thinks you might have Pompe disease, it\'s often confirmed with these tests: Check a sample of muscle to see how much glycogen there is Check a blood sample to see how well the ""bad"" protein is working Look for the genetic problem that causes Pompe disease It can take about 3 months to diagnose Pompe disease in a baby. It can take as long as 7-9 years for kids and adults. After doctors are sure, it\'s a good idea to test family members for the gene problem, too.', 'Questions for Your Doctor What can I expect going forward? What treatments are best for me now?

You and your family may want to see a counselor to help you come to terms with what's happening, especially as your abilities change. A support group can also be a safe place to share your feelings and find understanding. Support groups can be a good source of practical tips, too. For example, if you have trouble eating, you can try adding thickeners to your food to make it safer to swallow. You might need to use a feeding tube to make sure you get enough nutrients."", ""What to Expect Because Pompe disease can affect many parts of the body, it's best to see a team of specialists who know the disease well and can help you manage your symptoms.

Babies can be treated, but because their symptoms are more intense and progress quickly, they usually don't live for more than a year. With late-onset Pompe disease, the muscle weakness gets worse over time and will eventually lead to serious breathing problems, perhaps many years later.

Fillings are also used to repair cracked or broken teeth and teeth that have been worn down from misuse (such as from nail-biting or tooth grinding).', 'What Steps Are Involved in Filling a Tooth? First, the dentist will use a local anesthetic to numb the area around the tooth to be filled. Next, a drill, air abrasion instrument, or laser will be used to remove the decayed area. The choice of instrument depends on the individual dentist\'s comfort level, training, and investment in the particular piece of equipment as well as location and extent of the decay. Next, your dentist will probe or test the area to determine if all the decay has been removed. Once the decay has been removed, the dentist will prepare the space for the filling by cleaning the cavity of bacteria and debris. If the decay is near the root, your dentist may first put in a liner made of glass ionomer, composite resin, or other material to protect the nerve. Generally, after the filling is in, your dentist will finish and polish it. Several additional steps are required for tooth-colored fillings and are as follows. After your dentist has removed the decay and cleaned the area, the tooth-colored material is applied in layers. Next, a special light that ""cures"" or hardens each layer is applied. When the multilayering process is completed, the dentist will shape the composite material to the desired result, trim off any excess material, and polish the final restoration.', ""What Types of Filling Materials Are Available? Today, several dental filling materials are available. Teeth can be filled with gold; porcelain; silver amalgam (which consists of mercury mixed with silver, tin, zinc, and copper); or tooth-colored, plastic, and materials called composite resin fillings. There is also a material that contains glass particles and is known as glass ionomer. This material is used in ways similar to the use of composite resin fillings. The location and extent of the decay, cost of filling material, your insurance coverage, and your dentist's recommendation assist in determining the type of filling best for you."", 'Cast Gold Fillings Advantages of cast gold fillings: Durability -- lasts at least 10 to 15 years and usually longer; doesn\'t corrode Strength -- can withstand chewing forces Aesthetics -- some patients find gold more pleasing to the eye than silver amalgam fillings. Disadvantages of cast gold fillings: Expense -- gold cast fillings cost more than other materials; up to 10 times higher than cost of silver amalgam fillings. Additional office visits -- requires at least two office visits to place Galvanic shock -- a gold filling placed immediately next to a silver amalgam filling may cause a sharp pain (galvanic shock) to occur. The interaction between the metals and saliva causes an electric current to occur. It\'s a rare occurrence, however. Aesthetics -- most patients dislike metal ""colored"" fillings and prefer fillings that match the rest of the tooth.', ""Silver Fillings (Amalgams) Advantages of silver fillings: Durability -- silver fillings last at least 10 to 15 years and usually outlasts composite (tooth-colored) fillings. Strength -- can withstand chewing forces Expense -- may be less expensive than composite fillings Disadvantages of silver fillings: Poor aesthetics -- silver fillings don't match the color of natural teeth. Destruction of more tooth structure -- healthy parts of the tooth must often be removed to make a space large enough to hold the amalgam filling. Discoloration -- amalgam fillings can create a grayish hue to the surrounding tooth structure. Cracks and fractures -- although all teeth expand and contract in the presence of hot and cold liquids, which ultimately can cause the tooth to crack or fracture, amalgam material -- in comparison with other filling materials -- may experience a wider degree of expansion and contraction and lead to a higher incidence of cracks and fractures . Allergic reactions -- a small percentage of people, approximately 1%, are allergic to the mercury present in amalgam restorations. The mercury contained in the amalgam releases low levels of mercury in the form of a vapor that can be inhaled and absorbed by the lungs. High levels of mercury vapor exposure are associated with adverse effects in the brain and the kidneys. Studies have found no link between the amalgam fillings and health problems and the\xa0FDA considers them safe for adults and children ages 6 and above."", 'Tooth-colored Composites Advantages of composites: Aesthetics -- the shade/color of the composite fillings can be closely matched to the color of existing teeth. Composites are particularly well suited for use in front teeth or visible parts of teeth. Bonding to tooth structure -- composite fillings micro-mechanically\xa0bond to tooth structure, providing further support. Versatility -- in addition to use as a filling material for decay, composite fillings can also be used to repair chipped, broken, or worn teeth. Tooth-sparing preparation -- sometimes less tooth structure needs to be removed compared with amalgam fillings when removing decay and preparing for the filling. Disadvantages of composites: Lack of durability -- composite fillings wear out sooner than amalgam fillings (lasting at least five years compared with at least 10 to 15 for amalgams); in addition, they may not last as long as amalgam fillings under the pressure of chewing and particularly if used for large cavities. Increased chair time -- because of the process to apply the composite material, these fillings can take up to 20 minutes longer than amalgam fillings to place. Additional visits -- if composites are used for inlays or onlays, more than one office visit may be required. Chipping -- depending on location, composite materials can chip off the tooth. Expense -- composite fillings can cost up to twice the cost of amalgam fillings. In addition to tooth-colored, composite resin fillings, two other tooth-colored fillings exist -- ceramics and glass ionomer.', 'Other Filling Types Ceramics. These fillings are made most often of porcelain and\xa0are more resistant to staining than composite resin material.\xa0This material generally lasts more than 15 years and can cost as much as gold. Glass ionomer is made of acrylic and a specific type of glass material. This material is most commonly used for fillings below the gum line and for fillings in young children (drilling is still required). Glass ionomers release fluoride, which can help protect the tooth from further decay. However, this material is weaker than composite resin and is more susceptible to wear and prone to fracture. Glass ionomer generally lasts five years or less with costs comparable to composite resin. The newest ones have an even better lifespan and, when placed in appropriate areas. are equal to composites.', 'Does Dental Insurance Cover the Cost of Composites? Most dental insurance plans cover the cost of the composite fillings up to the price of the silver filling, then the patient may have to pay the difference.', 'What Are Indirect Fillings? Indirect fillings are similar to composite or tooth-colored fillings except they are made in a dental laboratory and require two visits before being placed. Indirect fillings are considered when not enough tooth structure remains to support a filling but the tooth is not so severely damaged that it needs a crown. During the first visit, decay or an old filling is removed. An impression is taken to record the shape of the tooth being repaired and the teeth around it. The impression is sent to a dental lab that will make the indirect filling. A temporary filling (described below) is placed to protect the tooth while the restoration is being made. During the second visit, the temporary filling is removed, and the dentist will check the fit of the indirect restoration. Provided the fit is acceptable, it will be permanently cemented into place. There are two types of indirect fillings -- inlays and onlays. Inlays are similar to fillings but the entire work lies within the cusps (bumps) on the chewing surface of the tooth. Onlays are more extensive than inlays, covering one or more cusps. Onlays are sometimes called partial crowns.', 'Inlays and onlays are more durable and last much longer than traditional fillings -- up to 30 years. They can be made of tooth-colored composite resin, porcelain, or gold.\xa0An onlay can be used to protect a weakened tooth because\xa0it can cover the top chewing surface and distribute the forces around the tooth like a crown. Another type of inlay and onlay -- direct inlays and onlays -- follow similar processes and procedures as the indirect, but the direct is made in the mouth and can be placed in one visit.\xa0The type of inlay or onlay used depends on how much sound tooth structure remains and consideration of any cosmetic concerns.', 'What\'s a Temporary Filling and Why Would I Need One? Temporary fillings are used under the following circumstances: For fillings that require more than one appointment -- for example, before placement of gold fillings and for certain filling procedures (called indirect fillings) that use composite materials Following a root canal To allow a tooth\'s nerve to ""settle down"" if the pulp became irritated If emergency dental treatment is needed (such as to address a toothache ) Temporary fillings are just that; they are not meant to last. They usually fall out, fracture, or wear out within a month. Be sure to contact your dentist to have a temporary filling replaced with a permanent one. If you don\'t, the tooth could become infected or you could have other complications.', 'Are Amalgam-Type Fillings Safe? Over the past several years, concerns have been raised about silver-colored fillings, otherwise called amalgam fillings. Because these fillings contain the toxic substance mercury, some people think they are responsible for causing a number of diseases, including autism, Alzheimer\'s disease, and multiple sclerosis. The American Dental Association (ADA), the FDA, and numerous public health agencies say there\'s no proof that dental fillings cause harm to consumers. The causes of autism, Alzheimer\'s disease , and multiple sclerosis remain unknown. Additionally, there is no solid, scientific evidence to back up the claim that if a person has amalgam fillings removed, they will be cured of these or any other diseases. Although amalgams do contain mercury, when they are mixed with other metals, such as silver, copper, tin, and zinc, they form a stable alloy that dentists have used for more than 100 years to fill and preserve hundreds of millions of decayed teeth. In June 2008, the FDA said, ""Dental amalgams contain mercury, which may have neurotoxic effects on the nervous systems of developing children and fetuses.""', 'And there\'s more. "" Pregnant women and persons who may have a health condition that makes them more sensitive to mercury exposure, including individuals with existing high levels of mercury bioburden, should not avoid seeking dental care , but should discuss options with their health practitioner,"" according to the FDA. The changes come in response to a lawsuit filed by consumer groups and individuals concerned about mercury exposure. To settle the suit, the FDA agreed to update its web site.', 'How Should I Care for My Teeth With Fillings? To maintain fillings, you should follow good oral hygiene -- visiting your dentist regularly for cleanings, brushing with a fluoride toothpaste , flossing and using an antibacterial mouthwash at least once daily. If your dentist suspects that a filling might be cracked or is ""leaking"" (when the sides of the filling don\'t fit tightly against the tooth, this allows debris and saliva to seep down between the filling and the tooth, which can lead to decay), they will take X-rays to assess the situation. If your tooth is extremely sensitive, if you feel a sharp edge, if you notice a crack in the filling, or if a piece of the filling is missing, call your dentist for an appointment.', 'Problems With Dental Fillings Tooth Pain and Sensitivity Tooth sensitivity following placement of a filling is fairly common. A tooth may be sensitive to pressure, air, sweet foods, or temperature. Usually, the sensitivity resolves on its own within a few weeks. During this time, avoid those things that are causing the sensitivity. Pain relievers are generally not required. Contact your dentist if the sensitivity does not subside within two to four weeks or if your tooth is extremely sensitive. They may recommend a desensitizing toothpaste, may apply a desensitizing agent to the tooth, or possibly suggest a root canal procedure. Pain around the fillings can also occur. If you experience pain when you bite, the filling may be interfering with your bite. You will need to return to your dentist and have the filling reshaped. If you experience pain when your teeth touch, the pain is likely caused by the touching of two different metal surfaces (for example, the silver amalgam in a newly filled tooth and a gold crown on another tooth with which it touches). This pain should resolve on its own within a short period of time. If the decay was very deep or close to the pulp of the tooth, you may experience a "" toothache -type"" pain. This ""toothache"" response may indicate this tissue is no longer healthy. If this is the case, root canal therapy may be required.', 'Sometimes people experience what is known as referred pain -- pain or sensitivity in other teeth besides the one that received the filling. With this particular pain, there is likely nothing wrong with your teeth. The filled tooth is simply passing along ""pain signals"" it\'s receiving to other teeth. This pain should decrease on its own over 1 to 2 weeks. Filling Allergies Allergic reactions to silver fillings are rare. Fewer than 100 cases have ever been reported, according to the ADA. In these rare circumstances, mercury or one of the metals used in an amalgam restoration is thought to trigger the allergic response. Symptoms of amalgam allergy are similar to those experienced in a typical skin allergy and include skin rashes and itching . Patients who suffer amalgam allergies typically have a medical or family history of allergies to metals. Once an allergy is confirmed, another restorative material can be used. Deteriorating Fillings Constant pressure from chewing, grinding, or clenching can cause dental fillings to wear away, chip, or crack. Although you may not be able to tell that a filling is wearing down, your dentist can identify weaknesses in them during a regular check-up.', 'If the seal between the tooth enamel and the filling breaks down, food particles and decay-causing bacteria can work their way under the filling. You then run the risk of developing additional decay in that tooth. Decay that is left untreated can progress to infect the dental pulp and may cause an abscessed tooth. If the filling is large or the recurrent decay is extensive, there may not be enough tooth structure remaining to support a replacement filling. In these cases, your dentist may need to replace the filling with a crown. New fillings that fall out may be the result of improper cavity preparation, contamination before the filling is placed, or a fracture of the filling from bite or chewing trauma. Older restorations will generally be lost due to decay or fracturing of the remaining tooth.']"
17,Fertility Tests for Women,"[""If you and your partner are trying to have a baby but haven't been able to, you may start to wonder if you should get fertility tests. Experts say it's time to check with a doctor if you've had regular sex without birth control for 12 months if you are under the age of 35 and for 6 months if you are over 35. It's important for the two of you to go for testing together. When you see your doctor, they'll probably start by asking questions about your health and lifestyle. They'll want to know things about you and your partner like: Medical history, including any long-term conditions or surgeries Medicines you take Whether you smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol , eat or drink things with caffeine , or use illicit drugs If you had contact with chemicals, toxins, or radiation at home or work They'll also want to know about your sex life, such as: How often you have sex Your history of birth control use If you've had sexually transmitted diseases Any problems having sex Whether either of you had sex outside the relationship Your doctor will also have questions about things connected with your periods, such as: Have you been pregnant before? How often have you had periods over the last year? Have you had irregular and missed periods or had spotting between periods? Did you have any changes in blood flow or the appearance of large blood clots ? Have you ever seen a doctor for infertility , and did you get any treatment?"", 'Infertility Tests for Women There is no single best test for infertility . Doctors use a variety of ways to identify any problems that might help cause fertility trouble. You may get a Pap smear , which is used to detect abnormal cells around the cervix. The test can\xa0detect cervical cancer and\xa0other problems with the cervix , or sexually transmitted diseases. Any of these can interfere with getting pregnant. To get pregnant , you need to release an egg each month -- called ""ovulation."" You may need tests that check for that. Your doctor may ask you to take a urine test at home for luteinizing hormone, or LH. This hormone shows up in high levels just before you ovulate.', ""Your doctor also may check levels of the hormone progesterone in your blood. Increases in progesterone show that you are ovulating. On your own, you can check your body temperature each morning. Basal body temperature rises a bit just after ovulation. By checking it each morning, you'll learn your pattern of ovulation over several months. Your doctor may also run tests on your thyroid , or check for other hormonal problems, to rule out conditions that might cause missed or irregular ovulation."", 'Tests of Reproductive Organs Before you can get pregnant, your uterus, fallopian tubes , and ovaries all need to work right. Your doctor may suggest different procedures that can check the health of these organs: Hysterosalpingogram ( HSG ). Also called a ""tubogram,"" this is a series of X-rays of your fallopian tubes and uterus. The X-rays are taken after your doctor injects liquid dye through the vagina. Another method uses saline and air instead of dye and an ultrasound . The HSG can help you learn if your fallopian tubes are blocked or if you have any defects of your uterus. The test is usually done just after your menstrual period. Transvaginal ultrasound. A doctor places an ultrasound ""wand"" into the vagina and brings it close to the pelvic organs. Using sound waves, they\'ll be able to see images of the ovaries and uterus to check for problems there. Hysteroscopy. Your doctor puts a thin, flexible tube -- with a camera on the end -- through the cervix and into the uterus. They can see problems there and take tissue samples if needed. Laparoscopy. Your doctor makes small cuts in your belly and inserts tools, including a camera. This surgery can check your entire pelvis and potentially correct problems, such as endometriosis , a disease that affects your pelvic organs.', 'Other Infertility Tests A doctor may order other tests to check for fertility problems. You may get a blood test to check your levels of follicle-stimulating hormone, or FSH, which triggers your ovaries to prepare an egg for release each month. High FSH can mean lower fertility in women. The FSH blood levels get checked early in your menstrual cycle (often on day 3).', ""Clomiphene citrate challenge testing can be done with the FSH test. You take a pill of clomiphene citrate on the fifth through ninth days of your menstrual cycle. FSH gets checked on day 3 (before you take the medicine) and on day 10 (after). High FSH levels suggest you have lower chances of getting pregnant. Your doctor may also suggest a blood test to check for anti-müllerian hormone (AMH). AMH levels can give an idea of how well the ovaries function. This is called their ovarian reserve. Very low levels can suggest low ovarian reserve. Another exam is called postcoital testing. Your doctor examines your cervical mucus after you've had sex. Some studies suggest it may not be so useful."", ""Your doctor may also recommend an endometrial biopsy . In this procedure, they take\xa0a sample of tissue from the lining of your uterus. But evidence is mounting that endometrial biopsy is not helpful in predicting or treating infertility . You may not need to have all these tests. Your doctor can discuss with you which ones are best in your situation. After the testing is done, about 85% of couples will have some idea about why they're having trouble getting pregnant.""]"
18,Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD),"['What Is PTSD? Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), once called shell shock or battle fatigue syndrome, is a serious condition that can develop after a person has experienced or witnessed a traumatic or terrifying event in which there was serious physical harm or threat. PTSD is a lasting consequence of traumatic ordeals that cause intense fear, helplessness, or horror. Examples of things that can bring on PTSD include sexual or physical assault, the unexpected death of a loved one, an accident, war, or natural disaster. Families of victims can develop PTSD, as can emergency personnel and rescue workers. Most people who have a traumatic event will have reactions that may include shock, anger, nervousness, fear, and even guilt. These reactions are common, and for most people, they go away over time. For a person with PTSD, however, these feelings continue and even increase, becoming so strong that they keep the person from going about their life as expected. People with PTSD have symptoms for longer than one month and can’t function as well as before the event that triggered it happened.', 'PTSD Symptoms Symptoms of PTSD most often begin within 3 months of the event. In some cases, however, they don’t begin until years later. The severity and duration of the illness can vary. Some people recover within 6 months, while others have it much longer. Symptoms of PTSD often are grouped into four main categories, including: Reliving: People with PTSD repeatedly relive the ordeal through thoughts and memories of the trauma. These may include flashbacks, hallucinations , and nightmares . They also may feel great distress when certain things remind them of the trauma, such as the anniversary date of the event. Avoiding: The person may avoid people, places, thoughts, or situations that may remind them of the trauma. This can lead to feelings of detachment and isolation from family and friends, as well as a loss of interest in activities that the person once enjoyed. Increased arousal: These include excessive emotions; problems relating to others, including feeling or showing affection; difficulty falling or staying asleep; irritability; outbursts of anger; difficulty concentrating; and being ""jumpy"" or easily startled. The person may also suffer physical symptoms, such as increased blood pressure and\xa0heart rate, rapid breathing, muscle tension, nausea , and diarrhea . Negative cognitions and mood: This refers to thoughts and feelings related to blame, estrangement, and memories of the traumatic event.', 'Young children with PTSD may have delayed development in areas such as toilet training , motor skills, and language. The intensity of PTSD symptoms may vary. You may have more symptoms when you feel stress in general, or when you encounter a specific reminder about what happened.', 'PTSD Causes and Risk Factors Everyone reacts to traumatic events differently. Each person is unique in their ability to manage fear, stress and the threat posed by a traumatic event or situation. For that reason, not everyone who has a trauma will develop PTSD. Also, the type of help and support a person receives from friends, family members, and professionals following the trauma may impact the development of PTSD or the severity of symptoms. PTSD was first brought to the attention of the medical community by war veterans; hence the names shell shock and battle fatigue syndrome. However, anyone who has had a traumatic event can develop PTSD. People who were abused as children or who have been repeatedly exposed to life-threatening situations are at risk for developing PTSD. Victims of trauma related to physical and sexual assault face the greatest risk for PTSD.', 'You may be more likely to develop PTSD after a traumatic event if you have a history of other mental health problems, have blood relatives with mental health problems, or have a history of alcohol or drug abuse. How common is PTSD? About 3.6% of adult Americans -- about 5.2 million people -- have PTSD during the course of a year, and an estimated 7.8 million Americans will develop PTSD at some point in their lives. PTSD can develop at any age, including childhood. Women are more likely to develop PTSD than men. This may be due to the fact that women are more likely to be victims of\xa0domestic violence, abuse, and rape.', 'PTSD Diagnosis PTSD isn’t diagnosed until at least 1 month has passed since the traumatic event happened. If symptoms of PTSD are present, the doctor will begin an evaluation by performing a complete medical history and physical exam . Although there are no lab tests to specifically diagnose PTSD, the doctor may use various tests to rule out physical illness as the cause of the symptoms. If no physical illness is found, you may be referred to a psychiatrist, psychologist , or other mental health professional who is specially trained to diagnose and treat mental illnesses. Psychiatrists and psychologists use specially designed interview and assessment tools to evaluate a person for the presence of PTSD or other psychiatric conditions. The doctor bases their diagnosis of PTSD on reported symptoms, including any problems with functioning caused by the symptoms. The doctor then determines if the symptoms and degree of dysfunction indicate PTSD. PTSD is diagnosed if the person has symptoms of PTSD that last for more than one month.', 'PTSD Treatment The goal of PTSD treatment is to reduce the emotional and physical symptoms, to improve daily functioning, and to help the person better manage with the event that triggered the disorder. Treatment for PTSD may involve psychotherapy (a type of counseling), medication, or both. Medication Doctors use certain antidepressant medications to treat PTSD -- and to control the feelings of anxiety and its associated symptoms -- including: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram ( Celexa ), fluvoxamine ( Luvox ), fluoxetine ( Prozac ), paroxetine ( Paxil ), and sertraline ( Zoloft ) Tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline ( Elavil ) and isocarboxazid ( Doxepin ) Mood stabilizers such as divalproex ( Depakote ) and lamotrigine ( Lamictal ) Atypical antipsychotics such as aripiprazole ( Abilify )\xa0 and quetiapine ( Seroquel ) Certain blood pressure medicines are also sometimes used to control particular symptoms: P razosin for nightmares C lonidine ( Catapres ) for sleep P ropranolol ( Inderal ) to help minimize the formation of traumatic memories Experts discourage the use of tranquilizers such as lorazepam ( Ativan ) or clonazepam ( Klonopin ) for PTSD because studies have not shown them to be helpful, plus they carry a risk for physical dependence or addiction.', 'Psychotherapy Psychotherapy for PTSD involves helping the person learn skills to manage symptoms and develop ways of coping. Therapy also aims to teach the person and their family about the disorder, and help the person work through the fears associated with the traumatic event. A variety of psychotherapy approaches are used to treat people with PTSD, including: Cognitive behavioral therapy, which involves learning to recognize and change thought patterns that lead to troublesome emotions, feelings, and behavior. Prolonged exposure therapy, a type of behavioral therapy that involves having the person relive the traumatic event, or exposing the person to objects or situations that cause anxiety. This is done in a well-controlled and safe environment. Prolonged exposure therapy helps the person confront the fear and gradually become more comfortable with situations that are frightening and cause anxiety. This has been very successful at treating PTSD. Psychodynamic therapy focuses on helping the person examine personal values and the emotional conflicts caused by the traumatic event. Family therapy may be useful because the behavior of the person with PTSD can have an affect on other family members. Group therapy may be helpful by allowing the person to share thoughts, fears, and feelings with other people who have experienced traumatic events. Eye\xa0Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) is a complex form of psychotherapy that was initially designed to alleviate distress associated with traumatic memories and is now also used to treat phobias .', 'PTSD Complications PTSD can cause problems in every aspect of your life, including your job, your relationships, your health, and your everyday activities. It may also make you more likely to develop other mental health problems, such as: Depression and anxiety Drug or alcohol abuse Eating disorders Suicidal thoughts and actions', 'PTSD Outlook Recovery from PTSD is a gradual and ongoing process. Symptoms of PTSD seldom disappear completely, but treatment can help people learn to manage it more effectively. Treatment can lead to fewer and less intense symptoms, as well as a greater ability to manage feelings related to the trauma. Research is ongoing into the factors that lead to PTSD and into finding new treatments.', 'PTSD Prevention Some studies suggest that early intervention with people who had a trauma may reduce some of the symptoms of PTSD or prevent it all together.']"
19,What Is Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)?,"['Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a serious mental condition that some people develop after a shocking, terrifying, or dangerous event. These events are called traumas. After a trauma, it’s common to struggle with fear, anxiety , and sadness. You may have upsetting memories or find it hard to sleep . Most people get better with time. But if you have PTSD, these thoughts and feelings don’t fade away. They last for months and years, and may even get worse. PTSD causes problems in your daily life, such as in relationships and at work. It can also take a toll on your physical health. But with treatment, you can live a fulfilling life.', 'How Does PTSD Happen? During a trauma, your body responds to a threat by going into “flight or fight” mode. It releases stress hormones, like adrenaline and norepinephrine, to give you a burst of energy. Your heart beats faster. Your brain also puts some of its normal tasks, such as filing short-term memories, on pause.', 'PTSD causes your brain to get stuck in danger mode. Even after you’re no longer in danger, it stays on high alert. Your body continues to send out stress signals, which lead to PTSD symptoms . Studies show that the part of the brain that handles fear and emotion (the amygdala) is more active in people with PTSD. Over time, PTSD changes your brain . The area that controls your memory (the hippocampus) becomes smaller. That’s one reason experts recommend that you seek treatment early.', 'What Are the Effects of PTSD? There are many. They may include disturbing flashbacks, trouble sleeping , emotional numbness, angry outbursts, and feelings of guilt. You might also avoid things that remind you of the event, and lose interest in things that you enjoy. Symptoms usually start within 3 months of a trauma. But they might not show up until years afterward. They last for at least a month. Without treatment, you can have PTSD for years or even the rest of your life. You can feel better or worse over time. For example, a news report about an assault on television may trigger overwhelming memories of your own assault. PTSD interferes with your life. It makes it harder for you to trust, communicate, and solve problems. This can lead to problems in your relationships with friends, family, and coworkers. It also affects your physical health. In fact, studies show that it raises your risk of heart disease and digestive disorders .', 'Who Gets It? PTSD was first described in war veterans. It was once called “shell shock” and “combat fatigue.” But PTSD can happen to anyone at any age, including children. In fact, about 8% of Americans will develop the condition at some point in their lives. Women have double the risk of PTSD. That’s because they’re more likely to experience a sexual assault. They also blame themselves for a traumatic event more than men do. About 50% of women and 60% of men will experience emotional trauma sometime in their lives. But not everyone develops PTSD. The following factors increase your risk: Previous experience with trauma, like childhood abuse Having another mental health issue, like depression and anxiety , or a substance abuse problem Having a close family member, such as a parent, with a mental health problem, like PTSD or depression Working a job that may expose you to traumatic events (the military or emergency medicine) Lacking social support from friends and family', 'Living With PTSD There’s no cure for this condition. But you can successfully treat it with therapy . Your doctor may also prescribe medicine, such as antidepressants . With proper treatment, some people may stop having PTSD symptoms. For others, they may become less intense. It’s important to seek help if you think you have PTSD. Without it, the condition usually doesn’t get better.']"
20,Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Tremors,"['What Is a Tremor? A tremor is when a body part moves or shakes and you can’t control it. Many people with multiple sclerosis (MS) have some form of tremor they can’t control, in different parts of their bodies, like their head, arms, or legs.', 'What Are the Types of Tremors? Intention tremor. There’s no shaking when you’re at rest. It starts when you try to reach or grasp something or move your hand or foot to a precise spot. This is the most common form of MS tremor, and it usually causes the most problems in day-to-day life. Postural tremors. You shake when you sit or stand, but not when you lie down. Resting tremor. You move more when you’re sitting still and less when you move. This is more common with Parkinson’s disease than MS. Nystagmus . This type causes jumpy eye movements.', 'Why Does MS Cause Tremors? This disease damages the protective sheath ( myelin ) that covers the nerves in your brain and spinal cord. Tremors can result from damage to a part of your brain called the cerebellum. It controls your balance and coordination and smooths out the actions that you make when you move your limbs and eyes or speak.', 'Medicines That Treat MS Tremors These problems are one of the hardest MS symptoms to treat. There aren’t any drugs made just to treat MS tremors. Your doctors may prescribe drugs for another condition that could help, like: Acetazolamide ( Diamox ), which treats a type of glaucoma and altitude sickness Buspirone ( Buspar ) and clonazepam ( Klonopin ), which are anti- anxiety drugs Hydroxyzine ( Atarax , Vistaril ), an antihistamine Isoniazid (INH), a drug for tuberculosis Primidone ( Mysoline ), a seizure medicine Propranolol ( Inderal ), which treats heart problems, high blood pressure , and migraines', 'Nonmedicinal Tremor Treatments Braces: These can hold your joint still and stop extra movement. A brace on your ankle or foot can make it easier to walk. They can help control your arm, hand, or neck, too. Deep brain stimulation: This experimental approach is mostly used for people who have tremors from Parkinson’s disease. A doctor implants electrodes into your brain. Wires connect them to a gadget in your chest. You use it to send your brain signals that stop the tremors. Medical cannabis : There’s little evidence that cannabis can help with tremors, but study results are mixed and usually only include small numbers of people. Physical therapy : It can show you exercises that increase your range of motion, improve your posture and balance, and make your body more stable Speech therapy: If you have tremors in your lips, tongue , or jaw, a health professional can work with you to slow your speech, make it clearer, and control the volume. Occupational therapist: This person will set you up with special tools called adaptive or assistive devices . They can help you grab things from up high or off the floor, pull up a zipper, or hold a fork more easily. Weights: Adding extra weight to a body part can help keep it still. You can also add weights to commonly used items like forks, pencils, pens, eating utensils, canes, and walkers.', 'Tremors and Depression Tremors can be tough to handle in social situations. You may feel like you want to be alone, but that can make you feel lonely and depressed. A psychologist or counselor can help you find ways to feel more comfortable in public and keep the tremors from changing how you live your life.']"
21,Potassium,"[""Potassium is a mineral that's crucial for life. Potassium is necessary for the heart , kidneys , and other organs to work normally."", ""Why do people take potassium? Most people who eat a healthy diet should get enough potassium naturally. Low potassium is associated with a risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, arthritis, cancer , digestive disorders, and infertility. For people with low potassium, doctors sometimes recommend improved diets -- or potassium supplements -- to prevent or treat some of these conditions.

The cells that help you use insulin may get hurt in the process. Some experts think losing belly fat may help you get better control of your blood sugar.', 'Prediabetes and sleep Studies show sleep loss can make it harder to control your blood sugar and appetite. That may be why your chances of obesity and type 2 diabetes go up if you sleep less than 5-6 hours a night. Your chances are also higher if the quality of your sleep is bad. If you have ongoing sleep problems, skip your afternoon caffeine . You’ll also want to avoid alcohol close to bedtime. Both can disrupt your slumber. If that doesn’t help, talk to your doctor. They can help treat your insomnia . Quit smoking Studies show people who smoke have a higher chance of prediabetes than nonsmokers.

25,Ectopic Pregnancy: What to Know,"['What Is Ectopic Pregnancy? Ectopic pregnancy happens when a fertilized egg implants itself outside of the womb, such as in a fallopian tube. A look at the symptoms of the condition and how doctors treat it. (Photo Credit: Science Photo Library/Getty Images) Usually, a fertilized egg attaches itself to the lining in your uterus. But with an ectopic pregnancy (also called extrauterine pregnancy), the fertilized egg grows outside your uterus. This can include other areas like a fallopian tube, the ovaries, in your belly, or the lower part of your cervix, which is above the vagina. In more than 90% of cases, the egg attaches itself in a fallopian tube. This is called a tubal pregnancy. How common are ectopic pregnancies? Rates are hard to determine, but one study suggests that about 1 in 50 pregnancies in the U.S. are ectopic. As the fertilized egg grows, it can burst (rupture) and can cause life-threatening bleeding. If this happens, you will need medical care right away. If you don\'t treat it, it can be deadly. In fact, ectopic pregnancies are the leading cause of pregnancy-related deaths in the first trimester . Can a baby survive an ectopic pregnancy? No. It\'s important to note that the fertilized egg in an ectopic pregnancy is not ""viable."" That means it\'s impossible for the egg to survive and grow into a baby that can survive in or outside your body. It will always result in a pregnancy loss. That\'s because the egg can\'t get the blood supply and support it needs to grow outside of the uterus. Ectopic pregnancy vs. miscarriage A miscarriage is when you abruptly lose a pregnancy before the 20th week. So while an ectopic pregnancy ends in a miscarriage, miscarriages can happen for other reasons like extra or missing chromosomes.', 'Ectopic Pregnancy Symptoms At first, you may not have any symptoms of an early ectopic pregnancy. They may seem very similar to those of a normal pregnancy. You might miss your period and have discomfort in your belly and tenderness in your breasts . Only about half of women with an ectopic pregnancy will have all three of the main signs: a missed period, vaginal bleeding, and belly pain. Early signs of an ectopic pregnancy include: Upset stomach and vomiting Sharp belly cramps Pain on one side of your body Dizziness or weakness Pain in your shoulder, neck, or rectum Signs of a ruptured ectopic pregnancy An ectopic pregnancy can cause your fallopian tube to burst, or rupture. Emergency symptoms include major pain, with or without severe bleeding. Call your doctor right away if you have heavy vaginal bleeding with lightheadedness, fainting , or shoulder pain, or if you have severe belly pain, especially on one side. You might need to call 911 or head to the nearest hospital to have it treated right away.', 'When Do Ectopic Pregnancy Symptoms Start? Symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy usually develop fairly early in the pregnancy: between the 4th and 12th weeks.', ""Ectopic Pregnancy Locations While most ectopic pregnancies happen in a fallopian tube, an egg can also attach itself to other areas outside of your uterus. Other types of ectopic pregnancy include: Ovarian ectopic pregnancy (OEP) When a fertilized egg implants on the outside of your ovary, it causes this type of ectopic pregnancy. OEP could happen because of problems with how your body releases eggs during your menstrual cycle. It's possible that an egg is fertilized while it's still in the follicle (a structure in the ovary), and OEP may happen as the egg moves from your fallopian tube to your ovary. Abdominal ectopic pregnancy In rare cases, a pregnancy happens in the space between your abdominal wall and spine (abdominal cavity). With this type of ectopic pregnancy, the movement of fluid in the abdomen may transport an egg behind the uterus where a sperm fertilizes it. Or an embryo might move from the reproductive tract to the abdominal cavity by traveling through lymphatic channels."", 'Cervical ectopic pregnancy This type of ectopic pregnancy happens when an egg implants in the cervical canal, and may happen because of damage to the space inside your uterus (uterine cavity). Cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy (CSEP) CSEP is when a fertilized egg attaches to scar tissue from a C-section. Since scar tissue is weaker than the lining of your uterus, it can tear and cause heavy bleeding. Symptoms of these ectopic pregnancies, like bleeding from your vagina and lower belly pain, are similar to the kind that happen in your fallopian tube.', 'Ectopic Pregnancy Causes You may never know why you have an ectopic pregnancy. One cause could be a damaged fallopian tube.

It usually forms on the ovaries, fallopian tubes, and tissue lining the pelvis. Scarring from the condition may stop a fertilized egg from reaching the uterus, causing an ectopic pregnancy.', ""Ectopic Pregnancy Complications During an ectopic pregnancy, the fertilized egg is wrapped in a structure that can grow for several weeks outside your uterus. But the structure usually bursts between 6 and 16 weeks. A ruptured ectopic pregnancy can cause severe bleeding. If the bleeding isn't stopped, your body might start to shut down due to the blood loss (hemorrhagic shock), and the odds of dying from it increase. If it's treated before it bursts, it rarely results in death. If the structure does burst, it may damage the fallopian tube it was attached to. Your doctor might remove the fallopian tube during the surgery. But you have two fallopian tubes. If your other fallopian tube is healthy, you should still be able to get pregnant. But if your other fallopian tube is damaged or not there, you may have fertility issues. In this case, talk to your doctor about other ways to get pregnant , like IVF (in vitro fertilization)."", 'Ectopic Pregnancy Diagnosis Your doctor will probably do tests that include a pregnancy test and a pelvic exam. They might give you an ultrasound to look at your uterus and fallopian tubes. An ultrasound for ectopic pregnancy is a noninvasive test that uses sound waves to create images of the inside of the uterus. The test is performed by a sonographer and may be done transvaginally or transabdominally. During the ultrasound, the doctor will look for the presence of a gestational sac, the location of the gestational sac, and whether there is a fetal heartbeat. The test is painless and usually takes around 15 to 20 minutes. An abdominal ultrasound test, which is performed by moving a wand over the abdomen, may be used to confirm pregnancy or check for internal bleeding.', ""Ectopic Pregnancy Treatment Because a fertilized egg can't survive outside a uterus, your doctor will need to take it out, so you don't have serious health problems. They'll use one of two methods: medication or surgery."", 'Methotrexate for ectopic pregnancy If your fallopian tube hasn\'t ruptured and your pregnancy isn\'t far along, your doctor can give you a shot of methotrexate (Trexall). You only need one dose of the injection. It stops the fertilized egg from growing. Your body will absorb the egg in about 4-6 weeks. With this treatment, there\'s no need to remove the fallopian tube. Before you can take methotrexate, your doctor will need to run a few blood tests to measure your levels of hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin). It\'s the hormone your body makes when it detects a pregnancy. You won\'t be able to take methotrexate if you\'re breastfeeding or have certain health problems. Once you get the shot, the doctor will check your hCG levels during follow-up appointments. If your levels don\'t drop after the first dose, you might need a second dose of the same medication. You\'ll need to follow up until your blood no longer has hCG. It\'s important to note that taking methotrexate is not the same as having a medical abortion, as you could get if you had a ""viable"" pregnancy in which the fertilized egg attaches inside the uterus. For a medical abortion, you need a combination of two prescription drugs: mifepristone and misoprostol.', ""The methotrexate that you take during an ectopic pregnancy before the egg bursts is medically necessary. It can lower your risk of dying or other serious complications. Surgery for ectopic pregnancy In other cases, you'll need surgery. The most common is laparoscopy . Your doctor will make very small cuts in your lower belly and insert a thin, flexible tube called a laparoscope to remove the ectopic pregnancy. If your fallopian tube is damaged, they may have to remove it as well. If you're bleeding a lot or your doctor suspects that your fallopian tube is ruptured, you might need emergency surgery with a larger cut. This is called a laparotomy. Surgery side effects can include: Pain Bleeding Infection Whether you take methotrexate or have surgery, you may feel tired for a few weeks and have some discomfort in your belly. You may continue to have pregnancy-like symptoms for a bit. It might take a few period cycles before you feel back to normal."", ""After an Ectopic Pregnancy It might be hard for you to have a typical pregnancy afterward. Consider talking to a fertility specialist, especially if you had a fallopian tube removed. And talk to your doctor about how long to wait before trying again. Some experts suggest giving yourself at least 3 months so your body has time to heal. An ectopic pregnancy raises your risk of having another one. If you think you're having another pregnancy, be mindful of the changes in your body. Check with your doctor, and they can confirm it and take the necessary steps. An ectopic pregnancy can take a toll on your mental health , too. Don't hesitate to reach out to mental health experts like a licensed counselor or therapist."", ""How to Avoid an Ectopic Pregnancy There's no way to prevent an ectopic pregnancy. But you can lower your odds with certain lifestyle choices. You can: Use a condom when you have sex. This can lower your risk for pelvic inflammatory disease and sexually transmitted infections. Avoid using a vaginal douche. Studies show that using a douche can increase the risk of ectopic pregnancy.""]"

Premature babies grow more slowly than babies born at full-term. They may be slower to roll onto their back, speak, or grasp and hold objects with their hands. They have a higher risk of certain long-term health problems, including autism , intellectual disabilities, cerebral palsy , lung problems, and vision and hearing loss . Other kids have behavior issues later on. Some have emotional outbursts or are hyperactive. They may have learning or reading problems in school. The earlier a baby is born, the more likely they are to have problems. Those born after 7 months usually need a short stay in the hospital’s neonatal intensive care unit (NICU.) Babies born earlier than that face much bigger challenges. They will need specialized care in the NICU.', ""Once you're both home from the hospital, watch for signs that you may need to call your doctor’s office or take your infant to the emergency room. Nursing. Your little one may eat slowly and not be able to take in as much milk or formula as a full-term baby. You’ll feed them more often, about every 3 or 4 hours. If they refuse to eat, call your doctor or nurse. If your baby has a hard time learning to breastfeed, ask for help from your nurse, doctor, or a lactation consultant. Sleeping. Your baby may be sleepier than full-term infants. They may even sleep through feedings. Wake your baby when it’s time to eat. Put them on their back to sleep. Breathing. Call your doctor or 911 if you notice they are having a hard time breathing. Body temperature. Preterm babies don’t have as much body fat to keep their temperature normal. Keep your infant away from cold drafts. Keep their room warm and cozy. In winter, dress them in layers to keep them warm."", 'Jaundice. If your baby’s skin or eyes are yellow, or they have trouble eating, it may be a sign of this condition. It means their liver can’t clear their blood of something called bilirubin. Make sure they have checked for jaundice before you leave the hospital, and call your doctor if you notice any symptoms. This can lead to brain damage if not treated early. Infections. Preterm babies don’t have a fully developed immune system. That puts them at higher risk for infections. Watch for symptoms of illness like high fever or breathing problems. Call your doctor if you think your child needs treatment for an infection.']"

There’s a connection between PMS and depression : Roughly half of women who go to their doctor for PMS also have it, as well as anxiety . PMS often causes mood problems, including depression during the time of the month that PMS symptoms appear, even among women who don’t have it at other times. If your doctor thinks your depression needs treatment, they may prescribe an antidepressant . There are many antidepressants, and people respond differently to them, so it may take time to find one that’s right for you. You may have success with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), including: Fluoxetine ( Prozac ) Paroxetine ( Paxil ) Sertraline ( Zoloft )', 'It can take 3 to 4 weeks before you see any benefits from an SSRI. Birth control pills (hormone-regulating pills). Many women with PMS have fewer unpleasant symptoms when they take birth control pills . This is probably because, when you take them, you don’t ovulate (release an egg from your ovary each month). Doctors think that not ovulating is probably the reason for milder PMS symptoms. Taking the pill also is more likely to improve your cramps, headaches , or other body aches, and help with the way PMS affects your moods.']"
28,What Is Presbyopia?,"[""What Is Presbyopia? Presbyopia is a decline in your vision when your eyes lose the ability to focus on things close to you. In spite of the big name, it isn't a disease. It's a natural part of the aging process, and it's easy to correct. Due to presbyopia, your eyes may have trouble focusing on things right in front of you, but it's possible to improve your sight. (Photo Credit: The Image Bank/Getty Images) Presbyopia vs. hyperopia Presbyopia is often confused with hyperopia (or hypermetropia) , more commonly known as farsightedness . Your vision is farsighted when the shape of your eyeball causes light rays to focus incorrectly (behind the retina vs. on the retina) once they have entered your eye. Your retina, located at the back of your eyeball, helps images reach your brain via the optic nerve. In presbyopia and hyperopia, far away objects may be clear, but those near you look blurry. Presbyopia vs. myopia Myopia, or nearsightedness, means that nearby objects appear clear to you, but things farther away seem blurry. In this case, your eye shape causes light rays to bend inaccurately, focusing light in front of your retina vs. on your retina. While presbyopia usually begins when you're older, around your 40s-60s, being farsighted or nearsighted can develop during childhood and run in your family."", ""Presbyopia Symptoms You may have presbyopia if you notice: You need to hold reading material at arm's length Your vision becomes blurry at a normal reading distance Headaches or fatigue when working on things close to you"", ""Presbyopia Causes In each eye, you have a cornea and lens that help your eyes see by focusing light on your retina. When objects are close or far from you, your lens will flex to change your focusing power. But your eye's lens hardens as you age, causing presbyopia. As the lens in your eye gets less flexible over time, it's harder for you to shift your focus on close-up objects, and they'll seem blurry to you."", ""Presbyopia Risk Factors Risk factors for presbyopia include: Your age. Most people will develop presbyopia as some point, usually between the ages of 40 and 65. Certain medical conditions. You may develop presbyopia at a younger age, also known as premature presbyopia, if you're dealing with heart disease, diabetes, or multiple sclerosis. Being farsighted. If you're already experiencing farsightedness, you may develop presbyopia symptoms sooner. Medications you take. Some drugs can cause presbyopia to start. Examples include antihistamines, antidepressants, and diuretics."", ""Presbyopia Diagnosis Your eye doctor can diagnose presbyopia with an eye exam . They may have you undergo two tests: Refraction assessment: Your doctor will have you look through lenses and assess how well you see objects near and far away. They'll determine if you have presbyopia, or another condition like hyperopia, myopia, or astigmatism, where your vision is blurry at any distance. Eye health exam: Your doctor will dilate the pupils of your eyes, making it easier for them to examine the inside of your eyes."", ""Presbyopia Treatment There's no cure for presbyopia, but there are a lot of ways to improve it. Presbyopia glasses Reading glasses/Readers: Yes, those cheap glasses you see at the drugstore can often do the trick because they magnify, or enlarge, what you're viewing. Pick the weakest pair that lets you see what you need to read. Bifocals: They work for many people. If you have prescription glasses already, this might be the option for you. They're eyeglasses with two different prescriptions in one lens. The top part corrects for distance vision. The lower section helps you see objects up close. Trifocals: They have three different prescriptions in the lens that will help you see close-up, far away, and an intermediate distance. Progressive lenses: These are similar to bifocals, but there's a gradual or blended transition between the two prescriptions instead of separate sections."", ""Presbyopia contacts Contact lenses can also treat presbyopia. You might try: Multifocal lenses: They come in soft or gas-permeable versions. Monovision lenses: One lens helps you see objects at a distance. The other is for close-up vision. Presbyopia eye drops Pilocarpine eye drops (Vuity) are available by prescription to help treat presbyopia. The drops work by making your pupil smaller, improving your focus on objects nearby. There are some side effects, like headache, that can occur. While using this treatment, there's also a risk of retinal detachment or retinal tears, so it's important to let your doctor know if you have sudden changes in vision like flashes of light or floating spots in your eyes."", ""Presbyopia surgery Laser surgery for presbyopia involves correcting one eye for distance vision and the other eye for near vision. Three options include: L aser-assisted in situ keratomileusis ( LASIK): LASIK surgery improves your eyesight by changing the shape of your cornea, the outermost layer of your eye. Light can more easily reach your eye's retina going forward. You can have this surgery if you have astigmatism or are nearsighted or farsighted. P hotorefractive keratectomy ( PRK): It also changes the shape of your cornea to improve your vision. Compared with LASIK, the PRK method doesn't involve cutting into your cornea, and it aims the laser on the surface of the cornea. PRK surgery can help astigmatism, nearsightedness, and farsightedness.\xa0It's recommended if you have thin corneas or dry eyes or are very active. PRK has a longer recovery time than LASIK, however. Small-incision lenticule extraction ( SMILE): A SMILE surgery uses a laser to remove a portion of your cornea shaped like a disc called a lenticule. Changing the shape of your cornea with this method can improve your vision. You may have this surgery if you have astigmatism or are nearsighted."", ""Presbyopia\xa0lens implants An intraocular lens (IOL) is an artificial lens for your eye. There are three presbyopia-correcting IOLs that can improve your focusing power.

Here, there's one corrective zone vs. multiple, but it still helps you see both near and far away. Presbyopia\xa0corneal inlays Intracorneal inlays are minimally invasive implants that help improve presbyopia, but they're not as popular as other surgery treatments like LASIK.

Corneal inlay products are still available, and others are being designed and tested. Presbia Flexivue Microlens is undergoing FDA trials. Another type, Raindrop Near Vision Inlay , received FDA approval in 2016. It was recalled in 2018 due to corneal haze issues, which causes the cornea to be cloudy and affects your vision. Other treatments continue to be researched to help presbyopia. Ask your eye doctor about options for your presbyopia and what's best for you."", ""Presbyopia Prevention It's hard to truly prevent presbyopia because it's part of the natural aging process. Still, you can work to take care of your eyes at any age by doing the following: Get regular eye exams. Talk to your doctor about how often you need a checkup based on your current vision and age. Use glasses or contact lenses with the correct prescription. If you need them, keep your contacts and glasses current so you're not straining your eyes doing regular activities. Protect your eyes when in the sun. Wear sunglasses that block ultraviolet radiation when you go outside for long periods. Still, let the light in. Good indoor lighting can help you avoid eye strain. Keep up with treatment of other conditions. If you have high blood pressure, diabetes, or other conditions, your vision may be affected. Avoid eye injuries. Wear protective eyewear appropriate for your job, sport, or other activities where your eyes could be hurt or exposed to toxic fumes, dust, or other irritants. Eat healthy. You may have heard that carrots are good for your eyes; they are because they contain beta-carotene, which your body converts into vitamin A. Vitamin A is a nutrient that supports eye health, and it can be found in a variety of fruits and vegetables. Foods with antioxidants also benefit your eyes—try leafy greens like spinach or kale .""]"

The earlier a baby is born, the more likely they are to have problems. Those born after 7 months usually need a short stay in the hospital’s neonatal intensive care unit (NICU.) Babies born earlier than that face much bigger challenges. They will need specialized care in the NICU.', ""Once you're both home from the hospital, watch for signs that you may need to call your doctor’s office or take your infant to the emergency room. Nursing. Your little one may eat slowly and not be able to take in as much milk or formula as a full-term baby. You’ll feed them more often, about every 3 or 4 hours. If they refuse to eat, call your doctor or nurse. If your baby has a hard time learning to breastfeed, ask for help from your nurse, doctor, or a lactation consultant. Sleeping. Your baby may be sleepier than full-term infants. They may even sleep through feedings. Wake your baby when it’s time to eat. Put them on their back to sleep. Breathing. Call your doctor or 911 if you notice they are having a hard time breathing. Body temperature. Preterm babies don’t have as much body fat to keep their temperature normal. Keep your infant away from cold drafts. Keep their room warm and cozy. In winter, dress them in layers to keep them warm."", 'Jaundice. If your baby’s skin or eyes are yellow, or they have trouble eating, it may be a sign of this condition. It means their liver can’t clear their blood of something called bilirubin. Make sure they have checked for jaundice before you leave the hospital, and call your doctor if you notice any symptoms. This can lead to brain damage if not treated early. Infections. Preterm babies don’t have a fully developed immune system. That puts them at higher risk for infections. Watch for symptoms of illness like high fever or breathing problems. Call your doctor if you think your child needs treatment for an infection.']"
30,Understanding Cancer -- the Basics,"['Throughout our lives, healthy cells in our bodies divide and replace themselves in a controlled fashion. Cancer starts when a cell is somehow altered so that it multiplies out of control. A tumor is a mass composed of a cluster of such abnormal cells. Most cancers form tumors, but not all tumors are cancerous. Benign, or noncancerous, tumors do not spread to other parts of the body, and do not create new tumors. Malignant, or cancerous, tumors crowd out healthy cells, interfere with body functions, and draw nutrients from body tissues. Cancers continue to grow and spread by direct extension or through a process called metastasis, whereby the malignant cells travel through the lymphatic or blood vessels -- eventually forming new tumors in other parts of the body. The term "" cancer "" encompasses more than 100 diseases affecting nearly every part of the body, and all are potentially life-threatening. The major types of cancer are carcinoma, sarcoma , melanoma, lymphoma , and leukemia . Carcinomas -- the most commonly diagnosed cancers -- originate in the skin , lungs , breasts , pancreas , and other organs and glands. Lymphomas are cancers of lymphocytes. Leukemia is cancer of the blood . It does not usually form solid tumors. Sarcomas arise in bone, muscle, fat, blood vessels,\xa0cartilage, or other soft or connective tissues of the body. They are relatively uncommon. Melanomas are cancers that arise in the cells that make the pigment in skin. Cancer has been recognized for thousands of years as a human ailment, yet only in the past century has medical science understood what cancer really is and how it progresses. Cancer specialists, called oncologists, have made remarkable advances in cancer diagnosis, prevention, and treatment. Today, more people diagnosed with cancer are living longer. However, some forms of the disease remain frustratingly difficult to treat. Modern treatment can significantly improve quality of life and may extend survival.']"
31,Primary Immunodeficiency,"[""What Is Primary Immunodeficiency? When your child has a primary immunodeficiency disease (PIDD), their body has a harder time fighting germs that make people sick. They may get a lot of infections in their ears, lungs, skin, or other areas that take a long time to go away. Most cases happen in babies or young children, but sometimes it doesn't show up until adulthood. There are many different types -- more than 200 -- and they affect different parts of the immune system. All make it more likely that they'll get sick from infections. Everyone with a PIDD has a different experience. If your child has it, in most cases they'll be able to go to school and make friends like other kids. As an adult with a PIDD, they'll be able to work and have an active, normal life. If your child's PIDD is mild, they may need to take medicines to treat the infections they get. Doctors treat some of the more serious types of PIDD with doses of antibodies to fight infections. They'll get these antibodies through an IV in their veins. The treatment takes several hours, and they'll need one every few weeks."", ""Some severe forms of PIDD may need even more serious treatment: a bone marrow transplant , which has a long recovery time. When you first learn that your child has a PIDD, you might worry that infections are going to rage out of control. But there are lots of treatments that can keep symptoms in check and help your child stay healthy and active. You don't have to face this alone. Reach out to family and friends for emotional support. Talk to your doctor about how to meet other families who have faced PIDDs, too. They'll understand what you're going through."", ""Causes You can't catch PIDDs like you can a cold or the flu . Your child has it because they were\xa0born with a broken gene that affects their immune system. Sometimes this problem runs in families. Or it may have happened on its own. Normally, your body's white blood cells fight infections. Some people with PIDDs are missing certain types of white blood cells, or those cells don't work very well. If that's true for your child, they're more likely to get sick from infections that wouldn't take hold in someone else."", ""Symptoms You may not notice any symptoms until your child is a few months old. They may get a lot of serious infections, or their illness may start out as a common cold but turn into bronchitis or pneumonia. Signs that your child may have a PIDD include: Has four or more infections a year in the ears, lungs, skin, eyes, mouth, or private parts Needs to get antibiotics through an IV for infections Gets more than one severe, fast-moving illness, like septicemia, a bacterial infection of the blood Has thrush (a fungal infection in the mouth) that doesn't go away Antibiotics don't work well Gets pneumonia more than once a year"", 'Getting a Diagnosis Your doctor will do a physical exam and may ask you questions like: Has your child had a lot of severe infections? If so, how long do they last? Does your child stay sick even after taking antibiotics? Do other people in your family tend to get sick a lot?', ""Your doctor may also want your child to get some blood tests. They'll draw some blood and send it to a lab to get it analyzed. Some tests will count the number of white blood cells that your child's body has. Other tests will measure certain proteins that fight disease, called immunoglobulins. Many states now test newborns for the most severe kind of PIDD, called SCID (severe combined immunodeficiency)."", 'Questions for Your Doctor What else could cause these symptoms? How can I keep my child from getting sick? What reactions should I expect from the treatment? Should my child get all the usual vaccines ? Does my child need to stay away from some sports?', 'Treatment Infections are going to happen, but treatments can take care of symptoms so your child can get well ASAP and get back to doing their favorite things. They may need to get higher doses of infection-fighting medications and take them for a longer time. If an infection is serious, your child might need to get antibiotics put into their veins through an IV.', ""Even if they're not sick now, your doctor may give them antibiotics or other medicines to prevent an illness. Your doctor may also suggest treatments that can make your child's immune system work better: Immunoglobulin (Ig) replacement therapy. These are disease-fighting proteins called antibodies that your child needs. Doctors usually give it through a needle, by IV. The antibodies only last so long, so your child may need a treatment every 3 or 4 weeks. They might have some side effects such as achy muscles or joints, headaches, or a low fever . Stem cell transplant. It's rare, but for a very severe PIDD, your child could need a stem cell transplant. In some cases, it's a cure. Stem cells help make new blood cells. They come from bone marrow, which is the soft center of the bones. For a transplant, a donor supplies stem cells with unbroken genes. Your child will need to find someone who is the right match so that their body accepts the new cells."", ""Close relatives, such as a brother or sister, are the best chance. Someone from the same racial or ethnic background may also be a good donor. If no one you know is a match, you can put your child on a waiting list. During the transplant, your child will get the new stem cells through an IV. They won't feel any pain from this, and they'll be awake while it's happening. It could take 2 to 6 weeks for the new stem cells to multiply and start making healthy, working blood cells. During this time, your child may need to stay in the hospital or, at the very least, make visits every day to get checked by their transplant team. It can take 6 months to a year until the number of good blood cells in their body gets up to normal."", ""Taking Care of Your Child Even with a PIDD, your child will be able to go to school, make friends, and keep up with activities. You'll want to meet with their teachers to explain their condition and to let them know they may need to miss classes because of illness more often than other kids. You should also let the school know about medications they'll need to take."", 'Just like anyone else, your child should eat good foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains , and lean protein. Make exercise a habit, and see that they get plenty of sleep, too. To keep germs away, wash hands often, lathering up with soap for at least 20 seconds. Teach them to keep rubbing their soapy hands together while singing the ""Happy Birthday"" song twice, which is long enough to get the job done. You can use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer when soap and water aren\'t available. Stress can make it harder for their body to fight disease. Encourage them to take time to relax, play, and enjoy hobbies. Massage therapy , exercise , being with people they like, and prayer or meditation are some other ways to lower their stress.', ""What to Expect Everyone's experience with a PIDD is different because there are so many types of this disease. Most people, with the right treatment, can live a full and active life."", ""The most severe forms of the disease may be treated, and possibly cured, with stem cell transplants, although that's not an easy process. When your child has this illness, the whole family will need lots of emotional support from people like friends, extended family members, and neighbors. Talk to your doctor about getting in touch with other families who have a child with a severe PIDD and can understand what it's like."", ""Getting Support The web site of the Immune Deficiency Foundation can help you find a doctor or get in touch with a support group. The site also has information about clinical trials . These test new drugs to see if they're safe and how well they work. Trials are a way for people to try medicines that aren't available to everyone. Your doctor can tell you if this is a good option for your child.""]"
32,Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension,"[""What Is Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension? Pulmonary hypertension is a life-threatening condition that gets worse over time, but treatments can help your symptoms so you can live better with the disease. It may take some planning, but plenty of people who have it find ways to do all the things they love, just as they did before they were diagnosed. Having pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) means that you have high blood pressure in the arteries that go from your heart to your lungs . It's different from having regular high blood pressure . With PAH, the tiny arteries in your lungs become narrow or blocked. It's harder for blood to flow through them, and that raises the blood pressure in your lungs. Your heart has to work harder to pump blood through those arteries, and after a while the heart muscle gets weak. Eventually, it can lead to heart failure."", ""Causes Sometimes doctors can't find a reason for high blood pressure in the lungs. In that case, the condition is called idiopathic pulmonary hypertension. Genes may play a role in why some people get it. In other cases, there is another condition that's causing the problem. Any of these illnesses can lead to high blood pressure in your lungs: Congestive heart failure Blood clots in the lungs HIV Illegal drug use (like cocaine or methamphetamine ) Liver disease (such as cirrhosis of the liver ) Lupus, scleroderma , rheumatoid arthritis, and other autoimmune diseases A heart defect you're born with Lung diseases like emphysema , chronic bronchitis , or pulmonary fibrosis Sleep apnea"", ""Symptoms You may not notice any symptoms for a while. The main one is shortness of breath when you're active. It usually starts slowly and gets worse as time goes on. You may notice that you can't do some of the things you used to without getting winded. Other symptoms include: Chest pain Fatigue Passing out Swelling in your ankles and legs"", 'Getting a Diagnosis If you have shortness of breath and see your doctor, they will ask you about your medical history. They may also ask you: Do you smoke? Does anyone in your family have heart or lung disease? When did your symptoms start? What makes your symptoms better or worse? Do your symptoms ever go away?', 'Your doctor may order tests, including: Echocardiogram : This ultrasound picture of the beating heart can check blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries. CT scan : This can show enlarged pulmonary arteries. A CT scan can also spot other problems in the lungs that could cause shortness of breath.', ""Ventilation-perfusion scan (V/Q scan): This test can help find blood clots that can cause high blood pressure in the lungs. Electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG): An EKG traces the heart's activity and can show whether the right side of the heart is under strain. That's a warning sign of pulmonary hypertension. Chest X-ray: An X-ray can show if your arteries or heart are enlarged. Chest X-rays can help find other lung or heart conditions that may be causing the problems. Exercise testing: Your doctor may want you to run on a treadmill or ride a stationary bike while you are hooked up to a monitor, so they can see any changes in your oxygen levels, heart function, lung pressure, or other things. Your doctor may also do blood tests to check for HIV and conditions like rheumatoid arthritis or lupus . If these tests show that you might have pulmonary hypertension, your doctor will need to do a right heart catheterization to be sure. Here's what happens during that test: The doctor places a catheter into a large vein, most often the jugular vein in your neck or femoral vein in your leg, and then threads it into the right side of your heart. A monitor records the pressures in the right side of the heart and in the pulmonary arteries. The doctor may also inject medicines into the catheter to see if the pulmonary arteries are stiff. This is called a vasoreactivity test. Right heart catheterization is safe. The doctor will give you a sedative and use local anesthesia. You can usually go home the same day, although you will need someone to drive you home."", ""Questions for Your Doctor You may want to write down a list of questions before your appointment, so you can make sure you ask your doctor everything you want to. It can also help to have a friend or family member with you to help you get the answers you want. Some possible questions are: What's the best treatment for me? How often should I see a doctor for my condition? Do I need to see a specialist? When should I go to the emergency room? Do I need to limit the salt or fluids in my diet? What kind of exercise can I do? Are there any activities I should stay away from? Should I get a pneumonia vaccine, a flu shot , and a COVID-19 vaccine ?"", ""Treatment Pulmonary hypertension varies from person to person, so your treatment plan will be specific to your needs. Ask your doctor what your options are and what to expect. First, your doctor will treat the cause of your condition. For example, if emphysema is causing the problem, you'll need to treat that to improve your pulmonary hypertension."", ""Most people also get treatment to improve their breathing, which makes it easier to be active and do daily tasks. Oxygen therapy, when you breathe pure oxygen through prongs that fit in your nose, will help if you’re short of breath and have low oxygen levels in your blood. It helps you live longer when you have pulmonary hypertension. If you are at risk for blood clots your doctor will recommend blood thinners . Other medicines improve how well your heart works and keep fluid from building up in your body. If you have severe pulmonary hypertension, your doctor may prescribe medications called calcium channel blockers. These medicines lower blood pressure in the lungs and the rest of the body. If calcium channel blockers aren’t enough, your doctor may refer you to a specialized treatment center. You may need more targeted therapies that can open up your narrowed blood vessels. They may be pills, medicines you breathe in, or drugs that are given through an IV. Options include: Pills: ambrisentan ( Letairis ), bosentan ( Tracleer ), macitentan ( Opsumit ), riociguat ( Adempas ), selexipag ( Uptravi ), sildenafil ( Revatio ), tadalafil ( Adcirca ), treprostinil ( Orenitram ) Inhalers: Iloprost tromethamine ( Ventavis ), treprostinil ( Tyvaso ) IV drugs: epoprostenol sodium ( Flolan , Veletri ), treprostinil ( Remodulin ) In more severe cases, or if medicines don't help, your doctor may recommend a lung transplant or a procedure called atrial septostomy. A surgeon creates an opening between the right and left sides of the heart. This surgery can have serious side effects."", ""Taking Care of Yourself One of the best things you can do for yourself is to stay active, even if you have shortness of breath. Regular exercise, like taking a walk, will help you breathe better and live better. Talk to your doctor first to find out what kind of exercise is best for you, and how much you should do. Some people may need to use oxygen when they exercise. Get plenty of rest, too. Pulmonary hypertension makes you tired, so get a good night's sleep and take naps when you need to. Just like anyone else, it's good for you to eat a healthy diet with lots of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. That's important for your overall health."", ""What to Expect A lot depends on what's causing your pulmonary hypertension. Treating an underlying condition will help you feel better. There's no cure for pulmonary hypertension, but the earlier it's diagnosed, the easier it is to live with. If you have idiopathic pulmonary hypertension -- the kind where doctors can't find a cause -- your symptoms may get worse over time. But treatment can slow down the progress of the disease and help you live longer. Remember that each person is different, and there are good treatments available. Work with your doctor to find what's right for you."", 'Where to Find More Information The Pulmonary Hypertension Association offers in-depth information on everything from medications to tips on making daily tasks easier.

33,Henoch-Schonlein Purpura (HSP),"['Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP) is a disease involving inflammation of small blood vessels. It most commonly occurs in children. The inflammation causes blood vessels in the skin , intestines , kidneys , and joints to start leaking. The main symptom is a rash with numerous small bruises , which have a raised appearance, over the legs or buttocks. Henoch-Schonlein purpura. Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP) is a disease that involves inflammation which causes blood vessels in the skin, intestines, kidneys, and joints to start leaking. The main symptom is a rash with numerous small bruises, which have a raised appearance, over the legs or buttocks. Other symptoms can include joint and abdominal pain as well as kidney impairment. HSP most commonly occurs in children and in boys more than girls. Adults who develop it generally experience more severe cases. Although HSP can affect people at any age, most cases occur in children between the ages of 2 and 11. It is more common in boys than girls. Adults with HSP are more likely to have more severe disease compared to children. HSP usually ends after four to six weeks -- sometimes with recurrence of symptoms over this period, but with no long-term consequences (recurrences are fairly common). If organs such as the kidneys and intestines are affected, treatment is often needed and it is important to have regular follow-up to prevent serious complications.', ""Causes and Risk Factors for Henoch-Schonlein Purpura The exact cause of HSP is not known. The body's immune system is believed to play a role in targeting the blood vessels involved. An abnormal immune response to an infection may be a factor in many cases. Approximately two-thirds of the cases of HSP occur days after symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection develop. Some cases of HSP have been linked to vaccinations for typhoid, cholera , yellow fever , measles , or hepatitis B; foods, drugs, chemicals, and insect bites. Some experts also say that HSP is associated with the colder weather of fall and winter."", 'Symptoms of Henoch-Schonlein Purpura The classic symptoms of HSP are rash , joint pain and swelling, abdominal pain , and/or related kidney disease , including blood in urine. Before these symptoms begin, patients may have two to three weeks of fever, headache, and muscular aches and pains. Rarely, other organs, such as the brain , lungs , or spinal cord may be affected. Here are some key details about the symptoms of HSP: Rash. The rash usually appears in all patients with HSP. The initial appearance may resemble hives , with small red spots or bumps on the lower legs, buttocks, knees , and elbows. But these change to appear more like bruises . The rash usually affects both sides of the body equally and does not turn pale on pressing.', 'Arthritis . Joint inflammation, involving pain and swelling, occurs in approximately three-quarters of cases, particularly affecting the knees and ankles . It usually lasts only a few days and does not cause any long-term, chronic joint problems. Abdominal pain. In more than half of people with HSP, inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract may cause pain or cramping; it may also lead to loss of appetite, vomiting , diarrhea , and occasionally blood in the stool.', ""In some cases, patients may have abdominal pain before the rash appears. In rare cases, an abnormal folding of the bowel (intussusception) may cause a bowel blockage, which may require surgery to fix. Kidney impairment. HSP can cause kidney problems, indicated by such signs as protein or blood in the urine . This is usually only discovered on urine testing, since it does not generally cause any discomfort. In most patients, the kidney impairment is mild and goes away without any long-term damage. It's important to monitor the kidney problems closely and make sure they clear up, since about 5% of patients may develop progressive kidney disease. About 1% may go on to develop total kidney failure."", 'Henoch-Schonlein Purpura Diagnosis and Treatment The diagnosis of HSP may be clear when the typical rash, arthritis , and abdominal pain are present. A doctor may order some tests to rule out other diagnoses, confirm the diagnosis, and assess its severity. Occasionally, when the diagnosis is uncertain, particularly if the only symptom is the classic rash, your doctor may perform biopsies of the skin or kidney. Urine and blood tests will likely be done to detect signs of kidney involvement and may need to be repeated during follow-up to monitor any changes in kidney function.', 'Although there is no specific treatment for HSP, you can use over-the-counter pain medicines, such as acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ), such as ibuprofen and naproxen for joint pain. In some cases, corticosteroid medication may be used. The rash and joint pain will usually go away after four to six weeks without causing any permanent damage. Bouts of the rash may recur in approximately one-third of cases, but usually they are\xa0 milder, do not involve joint and abdominal symptoms, and they clear up on their own.']"

The goal is to help with the head tilt that often comes with nystagmus. Sometimes surgery improves vision, too. Some drugs may ease symptoms in adults but not children. These include the anti-seizure medicine gabapentin ( Neurontin ), the muscle relaxant baclofen ( Lioresal ), and onabotulinumtoxina ( Botox ). For people who are very nearsighted , LASIK or Visian ICL can help improve eyesight. The surgeon may advisw you to take relaxation medication before the procedure to lessen the nystagmus."", 'Tips for Living With Nystagmus There are things you can do at home to make it easier to deal with your ""dancing eyes."" Use large-print books and turn up the print size on your computer, tablet, and phone. More lighting may help with vision, too.', ""If your child has nystagmus, encourage them to use their eyes. Big and brightly colored toys are easiest to use. Choose toys that make noise and have unique textures. Let your child hold books close to their eyes with their head tilted. Let them wear a hat or tinted glasses -- even indoors -- to reduce glare. Talk to your child's teacher to make things easier at school. It would be hard for them to share books or papers.

35,"Narcolepsy: Symptoms, Causes, Treatment","['What Is Narcolepsy? Narcolepsy\xa0is a brain and nervous system disorder that affects your ability to wake and\xa0sleep. People with\xa0narcolepsy\xa0have intense, uncontrollable daytime sleepiness. They may suddenly fall asleep at any time during any type of activity. In a typical sleep cycle, we enter the early\xa0stages of sleep, then the deeper stages, and finally (after about 90 minutes) rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. People with narcolepsy go into REM sleep almost immediately in the sleep cycle and sometimes while they’re awake. Type 1 narcolepsy comes with a sudden loss of muscle tone that causes weakness and makes you unable to control your muscles, called cataplexy. Type 2 is narcolepsy without cataplexy. In many cases, narcolepsy isn’t diagnosed and therefore isn’t treated.', 'Narcolepsy Symptoms Symptoms of narcolepsy usually develop over a few months\xa0and last for the rest of your life. What is the first sign of narcolepsy? Most of the time, excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS)\xa0is the first sign you have narcolepsy. In general, EDS makes it harder to do everyday activities, even if you got enough sleep at night. The lack of energy can make it hard to concentrate. You have memory lapses and feel depressed or exhausted.', 'Other symptoms of narcolepsy In REM sleep, we can\xa0dream\xa0and have muscle\xa0paralysis, which explains some of the other\xa0symptoms of narcolepsy: Cataplexy: This can cause problems ranging from slurred speech to total body collapse, depending on the muscles involved. It’s often triggered by intense emotions such as surprise, laughter, or anger. Hallucinations : These\xa0delusions\xa0can happen at any time and are often vivid and frightening. They’re mostly visual, but any of the other senses can be involved. If they happen as you’re falling asleep, they’re called hypnagogic hallucinations. If they happen when you’re waking up, they’re called hypnopompic\xa0hallucinations. Sleep paralysis: You may be unable move or speak while falling asleep or waking up. These episodes usually last a few seconds to several minutes. Disrupted sleep: You might have a hard time staying asleep at night because of things like vivid\xa0dreams,\xa0breathing problems, or body movements.

About 20% of people with narcolepsy have type 1, which includes cataplexy. Cataplexy can be mild or so serious that it makes you fall to the ground. Narcolepsy type 2. Most people (80%) with narcolepsy have this type, which doesn't involve cataplexy. It's harder to diagnose than type 1."", 'Causes of Narcolepsy Experts don’t know what causes narcolepsy. They think it involves multiple things that come together to cause problems in your brain and disturb your REM sleep . Scientists are getting closer to finding genes linked to the disorder. These genes control the production of chemicals in your brain that may signal sleep and wake cycles. Some experts think narcolepsy may happen because your brain has a hard time making a chemical called hypocretin. They’ve also found problems in parts of the brain involved in controlling REM sleep.', ""Narcolepsy risk factors Risk factors for narcolepsy include your age. Narcolepsy usually begins between the ages of 15 and 25, but it can show up at any age. If you have a family history of narcolepsy, your risk of getting it is 20 to 40 times higher. Narcolepsy epidemiology About 1 in 2,000 people\xa0have narcolepsy. But experts think only about half of those who have it are diagnosed, since many other conditions cause daytime sleepiness.

Your\xa0diagnosis\xa0might involve a\xa0physical exam\xa0and medical history. Your doctor might also ask you to keep sleep records to track of your symptoms and sleep times for a couple of weeks. Tests for narcolepsy Polysomnogram (PSG): This is done in a\xa0sleep disorder\xa0clinic or a sleep lab. It’s an overnight test that takes constant measurements while you’re asleep to record problems in your sleep cycle. A PSG can help reveal whether you go into REM sleep at unusual times in your sleep cycle. It can rule out other problems that might be causing your symptoms. Multiple sleep latency test (MSLT): This is also done at a special clinic or lab. The test takes place during the day to measure your tendency to fall asleep and find out whether certain elements of REM sleep happen at unusual times during the day. You’ll take four or five short naps, usually 2 hours apart. Lumbar puncture. You get this procedure, sometimes called a spinal tap, in a hospital or outpatient facility . A doctor or nurse uses a needle to remove a small amount of spinal fluid from your back. The fluid is then tested to check the levels of hypocretin. Low levels could mean you have narcolepsy.

36,What Is Pfeiffer Syndrome?,"['Pfeiffer syndrome is a rare birth defect that affects the shape of a baby’s skull and face. When you’re born, the top of your skull isn’t one solid piece. It’s actually made up of several bones with special joints between them. This allows it to expand so your brain has room to grow. Normally, the skull bones come together only after your head reaches its full size. But with this syndrome, the plates join together too early. The skull can’t expand as the brain grows, which affects the shape of the head and face. There are three types of Pfeiffer syndrome. All of them affect a child’s appearance, but types 2 and 3 are more severe. They can cause delays in development, as well as other issues with the brain and nervous system . Treatment starts soon after birth. Because the condition varies among people, the right care depends on your child’s signs and symptoms.', 'What Causes It? Pfeiffer syndrome is caused by a glitch in the genes that control how certain cells grow and die. It can be passed from a parent to child, but in most cases, the parents don’t have the syndrome. The baby’s genes have a change that seems to happen out of the blue.', 'What Are the Symptoms? They vary based on the type and how severe it is. It can affect the head and face, fingers and toes, and a number of other areas. Head and face: Signs of it often show most clearly here. This is partly because the skull can’t expand as it typically does. But Pfeiffer syndrome also affects bones in the mid-face, from the eyes to the mouth , which don’t grow as far forward as usual. When your child has the condition, you might see: A beaked-shaped nose Crowded, crooked teeth Eyes that appear larger and set wider apart than normal A head that’s short from front to back A high forehead A very small upper jaw', 'Fingers and Toes: It’s also common for children to have: Short fingers and toes Thumbs and big toes that are wider than normal and bend away from the other fingers and toes Webbed fingers and toes Other Problems: More than half of children have hearing loss . Some also have: Dental problems Acid reflux Sleep apnea (when you briefly stop breathing or take shallow breath many times a night) Vision problems', 'Types 2 and 3 Children with Pfeiffer syndrome types 2 and 3 often have delayed development and other issues with the brain and nervous system . Without early treatment, they’re also more likely to have life-threatening health problems.', 'Diagnosis A doctor can often tell whether your child has Pfeiffer syndrome from a physical exam as they check the skull, thumbs, and big toes. To make sure it’s Pfeiffer and not something else, your doctor may also order: X-rays or imaging, like a CT scan , to check the skull Genetic tests (taking a blood or saliva sample to check for the gene glitch that causes it)', ""Treatments Your child's treatment depends on the signs and symptoms. You might need a team of specialists that includes doctors, surgeons, psychologists, speech and language therapists, and more. Surgery tends to play a key role in treatment. Skull surgery: Most children have the first surgery to reshape their skull before they’re 18 months old. For children under 3 months, this can be done with very small openings in the head. For older children, doctors use traditional surgery. Typically, children will need two to four skull surgeries over the course of their lives. Midface surgery: Some children may need it to correct problems in their jaw and bring their midface bones forward. Children are usually at least 6 before this surgery is done. Treatment for breathing problems : Some children have blockages that make it hard for them to breathe. This leads to problems such as sleep apnea . To correct these problems, your doctor may suggest these: Your child can wear a special mask while sleeping. It’s called a “continuous positive airway pressure mask” -- CPAP for short. This is a standard treatment for sleep apnea. Midface surgery can help remove blockages. A surgeon can remove the tonsils or adenoids (tissues in the back of the nose that help fight infection)."", 'For severe cases, doctors may do a surgery called a tracheostomy . The doctor creates an opening in the child’s neck directly to the windpipe to allow for easier breathing. It’s done for children too young to have other surgeries to correct breathing problems. Other treatments: Your child may also need: Dental work to help with issues such as an underbite and teeth that are out of position Surgery to correct finger and toe problems Therapy to help with speech and language learning']"
37,Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC),"[""What Is Tuberous Sclerosis? If you have tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), your cells don’t stop dividing when they should. This means you get tumors in lots of places in your body. They aren’t cancer , but they can cause problems where they’re growing. There are treatments available that can shrink the tumors and make you more comfortable. Every case is different. You might get TSC in certain parts of your body, and TSC might affect someone else differently. The tumors can look like thick or light patches on your skin , and if they're in your lungs , they can cause breathing problems . Treatments can help you manage your symptoms and live an independent life. Between 1 million and 2 million people around the world have this condition."", 'Causes You get TSC because of a problem in your genes. For most people, it’s caused by changes that happened when your cells were first coming together or when you were just an embryo. Tuberous Sclerosis (Adenoma sebaceum). Also known as Bourneville disease, tuberous sclerosis is a hereditary condition that leads to abnormal growths on the skin and other organs. They are not cancerous, but TSC can cause issues depending on wear the tumors grow.  They first appear as small red dots and then later grow into fibromas. If they develop in your lungs, it could affect your ability to breathe. The disease may also cause tuber-like growths on the brain, which calcify and harden (becoming sclerotic) with age. This may cause retardation and seizures. Symptoms usually show up soon after birth. There is no cure for TS, but its symptoms can be treated and managed. About a third of people inherit TSC from a parent. If one of your parents has it, you have a 50% chance of getting it.', ""Symptoms Symptoms usually show up early, shortly after birth. But they can also appear later in life. Your symptoms depend on how many tumors you have, how big they are, and where they are. When you have TSC, all of that can change throughout your life. Tumors in a kidney can stop it from working like it should. They can also cause bleeding inside your body or high blood pressure. Tumors in your heart usually happen when you're young, and they shrink over time. But they can block blood flow or cause problems with your heart rhythm. Lung tumors can make you short of breath, even after mild exercise. They can also cause a cough or make your lung collapse. Tumors in your brain could cause: Seizures , which can be mild at first Behavior changes, such as temper tantrums , anxiety, or sleep problems Nausea or headaches Problems such as autism and developmental delays Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetic condition which affects how your cells divide. Growths can occur in many places in your body including, your skin, lungs, kidneys, heart and brain. TSC tumors aren’t cancerous, but they can cause problems where they’re growing. Seizures are a frequent complication, and some people with TSC have learning disabilities. There are treatments available that can shrink the tumors and make you more comfortable. Tumors in your eyes can make you see double or give you blurry vision."", 'In other places in your body, you may have patches of different color skin and dark or light growths that might look like warts. In your mouth , tuberous sclerosis can weaken the enamel on your teeth or make your gums overgrow.', 'Getting a Diagnosis With so many different symptoms, diagnosing this condition can be tricky. Your doctor will talk with you before doing any testing, asking questions such as: What did you notice that brought you here today? When did it start? Have you had seizures? If so, what happens? How long do they last? How often? How often do you have headaches ? How bad are they? Does anyone else in your family have seizures or epilepsy? Does anyone in your family have TSC? Your doctor may check your eyes and skin, as well as ask you to get imaging tests. These can include: A CT scan. This series of X-rays creates detailed pictures of your body to check for tumors and other changes related to the disease. An MRI. This makes a more detailed image than CT. An MRI scan can show how blood and spinal fluid are flowing, and can help pinpoint locations of tumors and other changes. The doctor may inject a dye to make certain kinds of tissue look different in the image. That helps them see changes faster and clearer. An echocardiogram is an ultrasound test of the heart. It shows tumors and other changes in the heart. Gene tests, done from a blood sample, can also confirm that you have TSC.', 'Questions for Your Doctor How fast might the tumors grow? How do the tumors cause the symptoms? How might my symptoms change over time? What treatments are available? What are the possible complications from those treatments? When do I need to go to the emergency room? Should the rest of my family be tested? If I have another baby (or if my child has a child), what are the chances that the baby will have TSC? Is there a local support network for families affected by this condition?', 'Treatment Your treatment will depend on your particular case. Doctors target the places where the tumors are growing. If TSC is affecting your kidneys , doctors may be able to block or reduce blood flow to kidney tumors, or give you drugs to help shrink them. You may need surgery to remove the tumors. At some point, you may also need dialysis or a kidney transplant.', 'If you have tumors in your brain , sometimes drugs can shrink them, or surgeons can remove them.', 'The drug Afinitor (everolimus) is approved by the FDA to treat specific types of brain and kidney tumors caused by TSC, too. When a child with seizures gets treated, it helps their brain develop, and they can learn better. Some people with lung problems from TSC take the drug sirolimus , which works on your immune system. Laser treatment ( dermabrasion ) can help ""refinish,"" or smooth your skin before tumors become large.', ""Taking Care of Yourself Having a disease like TSC can be tough, so find ways to reduce your stress and keep doing the things you love. If your child has TSC, remember they're still a little one. Let them be a child. Pay close attention to changes in your body, and tell your doctor about them. Keep up with your treatment, and make regular visits to your doctor, letting them know about anything that concerns you. Talk with your family and friends about the condition. They'll want to know how they can support you. Ask them for things you need, as they may not know what's most helpful for you."", ""Joining a support group can help you manage better. Hearing from other people and families who face similar challenges can help you understand what's going on and make you feel connected. They can also offer tips for dealing with symptoms. If you feel overwhelmed or depressed, ask your doctor if they can recommend a therapist or counselor who can help you."", 'What to Expect Although there isn’t a cure for TSC, your doctors can help you avoid problems. With the right treatments, most people with TSC can expect a normal life span.

38,What Is Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome?,"['Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is a rare reaction to antipsychotic drugs that treat schizophrenia , bipolar disorder , and other mental health conditions. It affects the nervous system and causes symptoms like a high fever and muscle stiffness. The condition is serious, but it’s treatable. Most people who get it make a full recovery when it’s found early.', 'Causes NMS is very rare. Only about 1 to 2 out of every 10,000 people who take antipsychotic drugs get it. All antipsychotic drugs can cause NMS. The older antipsychotic drugs include: Chlorpromazine ( Thorazine ) Fluphenazine ( Prolixin ) Haloperidol ( Haldol ) Loxapine ( Loxitane ) Perphenazine ( Etrafon ) Thioridazine ( Mellaril ) Doctors call the newer antipsychotic drugs ""atypical antipsychotics."" They include: Aripiprazole ( Abilify ) Asenapine ( Saphris ) Brexpiprazole ( Rexulti ) Cariprazine ( Vraylar ) Clozapine ( Clozaril ) Iloperidone ( Fanapt ) Olanzapine ( Zyprexa ) Paliperidone ( Invega ) Quetiapine ( Seroquel ) Risperidone ( Risperdal ) Ziprazidone ( Geodon ) These drugs block a brain chemical called dopamine. That can make your muscles stiff and can cause rigid movements in people with Parkinson\'s disease . Any antipsychotic drug can cause NMS. But stronger drugs, like fluphenazine and haloperidol, are more likely to trigger it.', ""NMS is more common in men than in women. You're also more likely to get it if you: Take a high dose of the drug Quickly increase your dose Get the medicine as a shot Switch from one antipsychotic drug to another Some drugs used to treat nausea and vomiting can also cause NMS, because they block dopamine. These include: Domperidone (Motilium) Droperidol (Inapsine) Metoclopramide ( Reglan ) Prochlorperazine ( Compazine ) Promethazine ( Phenergan ) People who take drugs for Parkinson's disease , like levodopa, can get NMS if they stop taking their medicine too quickly."", 'Symptoms These often start within 2 weeks after you first take the medicine or have your dosage changed. Sometimes, they show up a few days after you start to take it. Or you might not have any until months later. NMS symptoms usually last for 7 to 10 days. They may include: High fever (102 to 104 F) Muscle stiffness Sweating a lot Anxiety\xa0or other changes in mental state Fast or abnormal heartbeat Quick breathing More saliva than usual', 'NMS can damage muscles and cause very high or low blood pressure . If you’re not treated, you can get serious problems, like: Kidney failure Heart and lung failure Lack of oxygen in the body Infection in the lungs caused by breathing in fluid (aspiration pneumonia) More acid in the body', 'Diagnosis Your doctor will look for the two main symptoms of NMS: a high temperature and stiff muscles. To be diagnosed with it, you also need to have a few other warning signs, like a fast heartbeat, low or high blood pressure, and sweating . Some other disorders have symptoms that are similar to NMS. To figure out if you have it, your doctor will do one or more of these tests: Blood and urine tests Brain imaging scans Test of spinal fluid EEG\xa0to find electrical problems in the brain', 'Treatment Your doctor will first take you off the drug that caused this syndrome. Often, people with NMS get treatment in a hospital intensive care unit. The goal is to bring down your fever and give you fluids and nutrition.', ""Medicines used to treat NMS include: Drugs that relax tight muscles, such as dantrolene ( Dantrium ) Parkinson's disease drugs that make your body produce more dopamine, such as amantadine ( Symmetrel ) or bromocriptine (Parlodel) If these medicines don't help, your doctor might try electroconvulsive therapy. During this treatment, you’re asleep and pain-free. A small electric current travels through your brain to trigger a seizure . This won’t hurt you, and it should help your symptoms. NMS usually gets better in 1 to 2 weeks. After recovery, most people can start taking antipsychotic medicine again. Your doctor might switch you to a different drug. NMS can come back after you’re treated. Your doctor will closely check for any signs of it. The longer you wait to go back on antipsychotic drugs, the less likely you'll be to get NMS again.""]"
39,What Is a PKU Test?,"[""Your newborn seems perfect. They've got 10 fingers and toes and \xa0a hearty appetite. But even healthy-looking babies can have problems you can’t see. A simple blood test looks for rare conditions, including phenylketonuria (PKU), which can harm your baby’s growing brain . PKU is a rare genetic condition that affects metabolism -- the way your body turns food into energy. Babies with PKU can’t make an enzyme needed to break down phenylalanine (Phe) – an amino acid found in protein. Amino acids regulate almost all of the metabolic processes in the human body. If Phe builds up in the blood , it causes damage. Every baby in the United States is tested for PKU as part of newborn screenings that check for many other conditions, too. There’s no cure. But with treatment, your baby can grow into a healthy adult."", 'When and How Is the Test Done? A health care worker at the hospital will take a blood sample no earlier than 24 hours after your baby is born. If you gave birth outside a hospital, bring your infant to a doctor in a day or two to get all the newborn screenings. Usually, the blood is taken through a prick in your newborn’s heel. It’s put on a special paper and sent to a lab. Your baby’s doctor will share the results with you.', 'What Do the Results Mean? The test measures the amount of Phe in your baby’s blood. A normal level is less than 2 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). More than 4 mg/dL is considered high. Even if your baby’s results aren’t in that range, it doesn’t necessarily mean they havePKU. It means they need more tests to find out for sure. If your baby is premature, they might get what’s called a “false positive” because the enzyme to break down Phe hasn’t developed fully yet. They could get a “false negative” if they aren’t eating (either breastfed or bottle-fed), are throwing up, or if the test was done too soon they were born.', 'Why Is the Test So Important? If PKU isn’t diagnosed and treated right away, it can cause lasting problems, including: Developmental delays Lower IQ Mood disorders Hyperactivity Severe intellectual disability', 'How Is It Treated? If your child has PKU, they need to be on a special, lifelong diet that’s low in Phe. You should start them on it as soon as possible, ideally within a week or 10 days of birth.', 'Your baby will be put on a Phe-free infant formula. They may be able to have some breast milk, too. Some kids need a stricter diet than others. A dietitian with expertise in PKU can make an eating plan specific to your child so they grow and thrive. Your child probably will need to eat carefully measured portions of fruits, vegetables, and low-protein cereals, bread, and pasta. Foods with higher levels of Phe generally are off-limits. These include: Dairy Eggs Meat, poultry, and fish Nuts Beans Foods or drinks with the artificial sweetener aspartame Since your child’s diet is limited, they’ll need to drink a special formula that contains protein (minus the Phe) and other nutrients they need. Regular blood tests and doctor visits help to show whether the diet is working. Some people take a medicine that helps process Phe such as sapopterin (Kuvan). It’s more likely to work in those with mild or special forms of PKU. Your child will continue their special meal plan, but they may have a bit more freedom while taking the medication . The control of phenylketonuria levels is a lifelong process. Adults with uncontrolled high concentrations of PKU can be treated with the medication pegvaliase-pqpz ( Palynziq ) to help reduce levels.']"
40,Signs of Child Abuse,"['What Are the Signs of Child Abuse? When you think of child abuse, your first thought may be of a child with bruises or other marks that raise red flags. But the signs aren’t always so clear. Abuse can be physical, sexual, or emotional. Or a child may be neglected, meaning their caregivers don’t provide for basic needs, like food or safety. What makes abuse even harder to stop is that most of the time, the abuser is someone the child knows. They may be reluctant to say something because they may want to protect that person or they are afraid of what the abuser will do if they speak up. It’s important to know how to recognize different types of abuse, and what you can do if you suspect it.', 'Types of Child Abuse Child abuse happens when someone harms a child’s body or emotional health, development, and well-being. There are 4 main types. Physical abuse means that someone hurts a child’s body or puts them in physical danger. It doesn’t matter if the child gets seriously hurt or if it leaves a mark. Any harm is abuse. It includes when someone: Burns a child Hits, kicks, or bites Holds the child under water Shakes or throws the child Throws objects at the child Ties up the child', 'Sexual abuse is any kind of sexual activity with a child, not just physical contact. It includes when someone: Forces a child to take part in pornographic pictures or videos Has any sexual contact with the child, from kissing in a sexual way to having sex Makes phone calls or sends emails, texts, or other messages that are sexual in any way Shows the child someone else’s genitals, as with “flashing” Shows pornography Tells “dirty” jokes or stories Emotional abuse is a pattern of behaviors that harm a child’s emotional well-being and development. This can mean when someone: Abuses others when the child is around, such as a parent, brother, sister, or pet Fails to show love and affection Ignores the child and doesn’t give emotional support and guidance Shames, belittles, criticizes, or embarrasses Teases, threatens, bullies, or yells', 'Neglect is when a caregiver doesn’t give the child basic care and protection, such as: Clothing Food Heat in cold weather Housing with clean living conditions Medical care', ""Neglect is also when someone leaves the child alone for long stretches of time or under dangerous conditions. Other types of child abuse include: Parental substance abuse. This happens when adults neglect or harm children through the use of drugs or alcohol . It includes situations like: A parent not able to care for a child because they're high on drugs or alcohol Giving illegal drugs or alcohol to a child Making methamphetamine (meth) while a child is around A pregnant woman's abuse of drugs or alcohol, which exposes her baby to these substances Medical neglect or abuse. A child is medically neglected when their caregivers don't provide them with needed medical or mental health treatment. Medical abuse is a rare situation in which a caregiver lies about a child's symptoms or harms them to try to get unnecessary medical attention. It's also called Munchausen syndrome by proxy . Abandonment. Many states consider this a form of child neglect. It happens when a parent leaves a child with no support or concern for their well-being, or when the parent's location is unknown. Human trafficking. This is basically a type of slavery. Children are trafficked when they're used for prostitution or pornography, or to beg, sell drugs, or work long hours for little pay."", 'Signs of Child Abuse Abuse can be hard to recognize. Kids can get cuts and bruises or show signs of stress for lots of reasons that are a normal part of childhood. So it helps to know specific signs to look for, and trust your gut as you look at the whole picture of the child’s physical and emotional health. Signs of physical abuse may include: Bruises, welts, or other injuries that can’t be explained or don’t match with the child’s story Burns , especially from cigarettes, that can’t be explained Injury marks that have a pattern, like from a hand, belt, or other objects Injuries that are at different stages of healing Medical or dental issues that go untreated', 'Kids who’ve been physically abused may also: Avoid any kind of touch or physical contact Be afraid to go home Seem to always be on high alert Wear clothing that doesn’t match the weather -- such as long sleeves on hot days -- to cover up bruises Withdraw from friends and activities', 'Signs of sexual abuse may include: Avoiding a certain person for no clear reason Bloody, torn, or stained underwear Bruising or bleeding around the genitals Pain or itching around the genitals that might cause problems walking or sitting Pregnancy or STDs , especially for children under 14 years old Refusing to change clothes in front of others Running away from home Sexual activity or knowledge that people usually have only when they’re older Signs of emotional abuse may include: Constant worry about doing something wrong Speech problems or delays in learning and emotional development Depression and low self-esteem Doing poorly in school Extreme behavior, such as being way too obedient or way too demanding Headaches and stomachaches with no clear cause The child doesn’t seem close to a parent or caregiver Showing little interest in friends and activities Signs of neglect may include: Always looking dirty Being left alone or in the care of other young children Eating more than usual at a meal or saving food for later Missing a lot of school Poor weight gain and growth Doesn’t get medical, dental, or mental health care (medical neglect)', 'You may see the same signs of neglect in children whose parents or caregivers abuse alcohol or other drugs. Signs of child trafficking could include: Missing school often Running away from home Sudden changes in style of dress or relationships Has an older ""boyfriend"" or ""girlfriend"" They talk about needing to pay off a debt They often care for children who aren\'t members of their family Their responses to questions seem rehearsed', 'What to Do if You Suspect Abuse If you suspect child abuse, it’s important to report it. It isn’t a private matter or a family problem. A child’s physical and emotional well-being, and maybe even their life, could be at stake.', 'You don’t need proof to report abuse. If you suspect it, call your local child protective services, police, a hospital, or a hotline, such as the Childhelp National Child Abuse Hotline at 800-422-4453. You don’t have to give your name.', ""If you suspect child trafficking, call the National Human Trafficking Hotline at 888-373-7888. Depending on the situation, there are many ways you can help the child: If they need medical care right away, call 911. Take the child to the hospital -- it’s a haven for abused children. Doctors can check for signs of abuse and give medical care. Help the child stay safe. If you think someone like a babysitter or day-care worker has abused your child, keep the child away from them and contact police. If you suspect a parent or caregiver, supervise the child while they're around that person. If the abuse happened at school, tell the principal about it. But report it to your local or state child protection agency, too. Help the child get therapy to start healing the emotional damage of the abuse. Encourage the child to talk to you about what happened. But don't make it an interrogation. Focus on listening. Make sure they feel supported and know this is not their fault. It’s best to not confront the abuser yourself. Instead, contact police or a child protection agency and let them handle it.""]"

Physical therapy (PT) is care that aims to ease pain and help you function, move, and live better. You may need it to: Relieve pain Improve movement or ability Prevent or recover from a sports injury Prevent disability or surgery Rehab after a stroke , accident, injury, or surgery Work on balance to prevent a slip or fall Manage a chronic illness like diabetes , heart disease , or arthritis Recover after you give birth Control your bowels or bladder Adapt to an artificial limb Learn to use assistive devices like a walker or cane Get a splint or brace People of all ages benefit from physical therapy. It can treat a variety of health problems.', 'What Is a Physical Therapist? These licensed health professionals engage in specific graduate training in physical therapy. You may hear them called PTs or physiotherapists. As of 2016, to be eligible to sit for the national exam, you need to graduate from an accredited higher educational institution with a Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT) degree.\xa0An additional state exam must also be passed to earn a license.', 'Physical therapists\xa0evaluate your condition and develop a care plan that guides your therapy. They may perform hands-on treatments for your symptoms. They also teach you special exercises to help you move and function better. In most states, you can go directly to a physical therapist without a referral from your doctor. Or your doctor might prescribe it. Check your insurance policy to see if you need a prescription to cover the cost. If you have a serious illness or injury, a PT won’t take the place of other doctors, but they will work with your doctors and other health care professionals to guide treatments. You’ll feel better and you’ll be more likely to get back full function in the area being treated, and in most cases, faster than without the guidance of a PT. PTs often have assistants. They’re also trained to do many types of physical treatments.', 'What Does a PT Do? At your first therapy session, your PT will examine and assess your needs. They’ll ask you questions about your pain or other symptoms, your ability to move or do everyday tasks, how well you sleep , and your medical history.\xa0The objective is to determine a diagnosis of your condition, why you have the condition, including impairments that either caused or are a result of the condition then develop a plan of care to address each.', 'The PT will administer tests to measure: How well you can move around, reach, bend, or grasp How well you walk or climb steps Your heartbeat or rhythm while active Your posture or balance Then, they’ll work with you to create a treatment plan. It will include your personal goals like functioning and feeling better, plus exercises or other treatments to help you reach them. You may take less or more time to reach those goals than other people in physical therapy. Everyone is different. You may also have more or fewer sessions than others. It just depends on your needs.

43,Hives and Your Skin,"[""Urticaria, also known as\xa0hives, is an outbreak of pale red bumps or welts on the\xa0skin\xa0that appear suddenly. The swelling that often comes with hives is called angioedema. Allergic reactions, chemicals in certain foods,\xa0insect stings, sunlight, and\xa0medications\xa0can cause hives. It's often impossible to find out exactly why hives have formed."", 'What Causes Hives? There are several types of hives, including: Acute urticaria. These are hives that last less than 6 weeks. The most common causes are foods, medications, and infections. Insect bites and diseases may also be responsible. The most common foods that cause hives are nuts,\xa0chocolate, fish, tomatoes, eggs, fresh berries, and milk. Fresh foods cause hives more often than cooked foods. Certain\xa0food additives\xa0and preservatives may also be to blame. Drugs that can cause hives include\xa0aspirin\xa0and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications such as\xa0ibuprofen, high\xa0blood pressure drugs\xa0(especially ACE inhibitors), or painkillers such as codeine. Chronic urticaria. These are hives that last more than 6 weeks. The cause is usually harder to identify than those causing acute urticaria. For most people with chronic urticaria, the cause is impossible to find. In some cases, though, the cause may be thyroid ,\xa0hepatitis, infection, or\xa0cancer.', 'Chronic urticaria can also affect organs such as the\xa0lungs, muscles, and gastrointestinal tract. Symptoms include shortness of breath, muscle soreness, vomitin g , and\xa0diarrhea. Physical urticaria. These hives are caused by something that stimulates the skin -- for example, cold, heat, sun exposure, vibration, pressure,\xa0sweating, or\xa0exercise. The hives usually occur right where the skin was stimulated and rarely appear elsewhere. Most of the hives appear within 1 hour. Dermatographism. This is a common form of physical urticaria where hives form after firmly stroking or scratching the skin. These hives can also occur along with other forms of urticaria.', ""The Link to Contact Dermatitis Contact dermatitis is a painful or itchy rash you get after your skin touches something you're allergic to (allergic contact dermatitis) or that's otherwise irritating to your skin (irritant contact dermatitis). It's not the same as hives. But sometimes people with contact dermatitis also get hives after they come into contact with an allergen."", ""How Are Hives Diagnosed? Your doctor will need to ask many questions in an attempt to find the possible cause of hives. Since there are no specific tests for hives -- or the associated swelling of angioedema -- testing will depend on your medical history and a thorough exam by your doctor. Your doctor may do skin tests\xa0to find out what you're allergic to. Or they may test your blood to see if you have an illness."", ""How Are Hives Treated? The best treatment for hives is to find and remove the trigger, but this is not an easy task. Antihistamines are usually prescribed by your doctor to provide relief from symptoms.\xa0Antihistamines\xa0work best if taken on a regular schedule to prevent hives from forming in the first place. Chronic hives may be treated with antihistamines or a combination of medications. When antihistamines don't provide relief, oral steroids may be prescribed. A biologic drug,\xa0omalizumab\xa0(Xolair), is also approved to treat chronic hives in people at least 12 years old. For severe hives,\xa0you might need an injection of\xa0epinephrine or a\xa0cortisone\xa0medication."", ""How Can Hives Be Managed?

44,Alpha-1 Antitrypsin (AAT) Deficiency,"[""What Is AAT Deficiency? Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency is a condition that can cause serious lung or liver disease. Symptoms often include trouble breathing and jaundiced, or yellow, skin. It's a genetic disease, which means it's passed down to you from your parents. You get it because your liver doesn't make enough of the AAT protein, and much of what it does make gets trapped in your liver. You need this protein to protect your lungs from inflammation and damage caused by infections and irritants such as smoke and pollution. If your lungs are damaged, you can get COPD or emphysema. AAT deficiency is sometimes known as genetic COPD or genetic emphysema. And when AAT\xa0builds up in your liver, the buildup may cause scarring, or cirrhosis, of your liver. You might not know you have the disease until you're an adult. Most people get their first symptoms between the ages of 20 and 50."", ""Symptoms of AAT Deficiency When you have AAT deficiency, your lungs don't get enough of a protein they need to protect them. This can lead to COPD or emphysema. (Photo credit: Lisa F. Young/Dreamstime) Common symptoms of AAT deficiency\xa0include: Wheezing or whistling sounds when you breathe Having colds often Feeling tired A fast heartbeat when you stand up Weight loss"", ""If AAT deficiency affects your liver,\xa0you could have: Yellowish skin or eyes A swollen belly or legs Coughing up of blood A newborn baby\xa0might have: Yellowing of the skin or eyes (jaundice) Bright yellow urine Trouble gaining weight An enlarged liver Bleeding from the nose or umbilical stump Pale, smelly poop Low energy It's rare, but some people also get a skin disease called panniculitis. It is inflammation of the fat layer under your skin and causes hardening of the skin along with painful lumps or patches."", ""How Alpha-1 Affects Your Liver Alpha-1 is a rare disease that makes an enzyme in your liver work poorly. Alpha-1 antitrypsin protein usually travels from your liver through your blood to protect your lungs and other organs. But if the proteins aren't the right shape, they can get stuck in your liver. This can cause cirrhosis , severe liver damage and scarring, and liver cancer . And because the proteins aren't traveling to your lungs like they should, it can also cause lung problems."", ""AAT Testing First, your doctor will listen to your breathing with a stethoscope to check for wheezing or other signs that your lungs aren't working right. Blood tests. These will show the levels of AAT in your blood and measure your liver function. A special blood test called a blood gases test looks at the oxygen level in your arteries, a sign of how well your lungs work. Genetic testing: If your blood levels of AAT are low, these tests will find abnormal genes and see if any have a link to AAT. Imaging. X-rays and CT scans show where damage is in your lungs and how serious it is. Pulmonary function tests. You'll breathe into a machine that measures how well your lungs are working. Liver ultrasound or elastography. These tests will show if there are signs of scarring on your liver. Liver biopsy. A small sample of cells is taken using a very thin needle and checked for signs of damage."", ""Questions for the Doctor It's important to ask your doctor any question you have about this condition. You might start with these: Have you treated other people with AAT deficiency? What treatments do you suggest? Is replacement therapy something that may be right for me? What are my chances of having COPD or emphysema? How will we know how I'm doing? Should my children be tested for this condition? Is it safe for me to exercise? What are some things I can do to manage my symptoms?"", ""Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency Treatment There's no cure for AAT deficiency. But you can protect yourself from more lung damage with a treatment called augmentation therapy, sometimes called replacement therapy. It works by raising the amount of AAT protein in your blood. You may also have this treatment if you get emphysema. With this treatment, you get a new supply of AAT protein from healthy human donors through an IV once a week. You can have this procedure at your doctor's office or at home with the help of a technician."", ""Augmentation therapy can slow or stop the damage to your lungs, but it won't reverse the disease or heal any damage you already have. You'll need these treatments for the rest of your life. You may also get a bronchodilator, or medication to open your airways that you breathe into your lungs with an inhaler. If your breathing trouble leads to low levels of oxygen in your blood, you might need extra oxygen through a mask or nosepiece. Your doctor may also suggest that you go into pulmonary rehab, where you can learn breathing techniques and exercises, as well as how to make some everyday activities easier."", ""Why Get Tested for Alpha-1? Though there's no cure for AAT deficiency, there are treatments to delay or prevent lung disease. It's also important to know if you can pass the genes on to family members. A healthy lifestyle--including a balanced diet, regular exercise, and not smoking--can help keep your lungs in the best possible shape. If you do develop lung disease, you can work with your doctor on a plan to help you manage symptoms and feel your best."", ""Your Care Team for AAT Deficiency Your health care team is an important part of diagnosing and treating AAT deficiency. Here are some of the medical professionals you could visit for care: Pediatrician. You're more likely to get AAT deficiency as an adult, but kids get it, too. A pediatrician takes care of the general health of children and young adults, or they may specialize in certain health conditions. Geneticist. Since AAT deficiency is a genetic disease, your doctor may suggest genetic testing to precisely diagnose or help manage it. Geneticists and genetic counselors work with you and your regular doctor to include genetic information in your health care plan. Pulmonologist. These doctors diagnose and treat illnesses that affect your lungs, such as AAT deficiency. Gastroenterologist. AAT deficiency can also affect your liver, one of the organs that gastroenterologists focus on. These doctors mainly diagnose and treat diseases affecting your digestive tract. Pulmonary rehab team. Experts suggest pulmonary rehabilitation for people with AAT deficiency. This is a program of exercise, breathing techniques, education, nutrition, and more. It's designed to help people with pulmonary disease. Doctors, nurses, physical and respiratory therapists, exercise specialists, and dietitians could all be part of your rehab team."", ""What to Expect With AAT Deficiency AAT deficiency is different for everyone. Some people have severe problems. Others may have few or no symptoms. Breathing issues. You'll be more sensitive to smoke, dust, and allergens like pollen. If you catch a cold, your symptoms may be stronger. You also might have chronic bronchitis, an irritation of your airways that causes coughing and affects breathing. COPD. AAT deficiency can cause chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). When you have COPD, you often have symptoms of emphysema, a serious condition that makes it hard for you to push air out of your lungs. COPD can make you wheeze and struggle to breathe. You may cough up mucus and feel tightness in your chest. Liver issues. About 30% to 40% of people with this condition will have liver problems at some point in their lives. While these health issues are possibilities, with treatment, you'll probably still be able to work, be active, and enjoy many of your favorite hobbies. In babies and children, the condition is more likely to cause liver damage than lung problems. Still, only about 10% of children with it have severe liver disease. Children with AAT deficiency also may have asthma."", 'Treating Liver Problems If your liver is damaged, you can get treatment to help prevent or slow down the health problems this can cause. You can also get treatments to ease symptoms. These include: Vitamin supplements Medicines to ease itching or jaundice Treatments for bleeding and fluid in your belly If your liver damage is life-threatening or severe, you may need a liver transplant.', ""How Your AAT Deficiency Might Change Over Time You could have the gene that causes AAT deficiency and never have symptoms or organ damage. This is especially true if you avoid smoking. Meanwhile, others with the illness have serious, even deadly health problems. Other conditions that can happen with AAT deficiency include: Lung conditions that get worse over time, like COPD Lasting airway damage (emphysema, bronchiectasis) High blood pressure that affects the arteries from your heart to your lungs (pulmonary hypertension) Liver scarring Liver cancer Heart, liver, or respiratory failure Inflammation of fat beneath the skin (panniculitis) Many people with AAT deficiency live a normal lifespan, especially if they don't smoke. Others may have serious complications. Your medical outlook depends on: Whether you're diagnosed promptly The type of Alpha-1 you have How the disease impacts you Your level of organ damage How strong your lungs are If your lung or liver disease is getting worse quickly or more slowly If you smoke The best thing you can do is follow guidance from your doctor to manage your condition."", ""Tips for Living With AAT Deficiency Good habits are important to help you stay healthy with this condition. There are several things you can do to manage your symptoms: Stay away from things that can irritate your lungs, like smoke, dust, and pet hair. Steer clear of infections: Wash your hands often, and stay away from others who are sick. Pay attention to how you feel, and pace yourself if you need to. Take your medications as prescribed. Stay up to date on vaccines, including those for flu and COVID-19. Talk to your doctor about how to exercise safely. Limit how much alcohol you drink. If you don't drink, don't start. Don't smoke. If you need help to quit, talk to your doctor. Eat a healthful diet. Make daily tasks easier: Plan chores so you can cut down on climbing stairs, or use a rolling cart to move things from place to place. Get the support you need: Ask friends and family for help with tasks. Consider joining a support group to talk with others in a similar situation. If you have feelings of depression, talk to your doctor or a counselor about what treatments may help."", 'Caring for Your Emotional and Mental Health Living with AAT deficiency can affect your emotional health. You\'re more likely to have feelings of anxiety and depression than someone who doesn\'t have it. It\'s important to be aware of how you feel and take steps to help yourself feel better.

Whether it\'s taking over some chores for a while or giving a listening ear, support from your loved ones can make a big difference. Let loved ones know how they can help you when you\'re not feeling your best.', ""The Future of Treatment While augmentation therapy works to slow or stop lung damage from AAT deficiency, it's only for people who are seriously ill. This means people with less severe symptoms often don't get treatment. Augmentation therapy is also expensive, and weekly treatments can be inconvenient. Also, it only treats lung disease, not liver disease that sometimes forms when you have AAT deficiency. Researchers are now looking into new options for people living with this lifelong disease. Here's a closer look at some of them: Recombinant AAT (rAAT) AAT can come from two sources: human plasma and through the use of recombinant technology. Scientists use this technology to create new proteins or change existing ones. In the future, it could be a more consistent and reliable source of AAT. But it's a newer technology and not approved to treat AAT deficiency."", ""Inhaled AAT People with AAT deficiency have replacement therapy through an IV, which can be inconvenient and uncomfortable. Researchers are now studying an inhaler that delivers AAT directly to your lungs. They've found it may work even better than an IV, since most AAT-related damage happens in the lungs. Several studies have found AAT inhalers are safe and boost AAT levels in the lungs."", 'Other emerging treatments Other treatments for AAT deficiency are in different stages of development. They include: Gene therapy. This involves replacing the faulty gene responsible for AAT deficiency with a healthy one. Research into gene therapy for AAT deficiency has been mixed. The results of one study showed the treatment is safe and worked to keep AAT levels in the normal range. But the results of another study showed lower AAT levels. Stem cell therapy. This treatment replaces damaged cells with healthy stem cells. The stem cells come from people with AAT, which scientists use to study and create treatments for the disease. Small molecule therapy. These are drugs that target specific molecules involved in disease. In AAT deficiency, they could help slow liver damage by stopping the protein from building up in liver cells. This type of therapy shows promise but needs more research.']"
45,What Is Pick's Disease?,"['Pick\'s disease is a kind of dementia similar to Alzheimer\'s but far less common. It affects parts of the brain that control emotions, behavior, personality, and language. It\'s also a type of disorder known as frontotemporal dementia (FTD) or frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Your brain uses a transport system to help move around the nutrients it needs. This system is made of proteins that like railroad tracks guiding trains guide nutrients where they need to go. The proteins that keep the tracks straight are called tau proteins. When you have Pick\'s disease, the tau proteins don\'t work the way they should. You may also have more of them in your brain than other people. These abnormal clumps of tau proteins are called Pick bodies. Pick bodies ""derail"" your transport system. The track is no longer straight, and nutrients in the brain can\'t get where they need to go. This causes brain damage that can\'t be reversed. Around 50,000 to 60,000 people in the U.S. have Pick\'s disease. It\'s usually diagnosed between the ages of 40 and 75, but it can happen in people as young as 20. It affects more men than women. People of Scandinavian descent are at a slightly higher risk of getting it than others.', ""Causes Up to 25% of people with Pick's disease received a gene that causes it from a parent. Experts aren't sure why it happens in other cases."", 'Symptoms Pick bodies typically form in the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain.

You may: Act aggressively toward others Be uninterested in everyday activities Be very aware of everything you do all the time Feel irritable or agitated Have drastic and quick mood swings Have trouble feeling warmth, sympathy, or concern for others Have trouble with unplanned activities Make rash decisions Repeat actions over and over Say and do inappropriate things Some people become hungry all the time, and some develop an unhealthy ""sweet tooth"" and eat much more sugar than they should. Problems with language usually happen early in the disease. Pick bodies in the speech section of your brain can cause problems with: Recalling names of common objects Copying simple shapes with pencil and paper Understanding written words Speaking because of halted or stilted speech Occasionally, people with Pick\'s disease might also have: Memory loss Problems moving Stiff or weak muscles Trouble peeing Trouble with coordination', ""Pick's Disease vs. Alzheimer's Disease Pick's disease has many of the same causes and symptoms that Alzheimer's does. But there are key differences. Unlike people with Alzheimer's disease , people with Pick's disease: Are diagnosed earlier in life Don't have hallucinations or delusions Don't tend to get lost in familiar places Have a harder time making sense of their words or the words of others Have behavior problems early on (behavior problems usually come late in Alzheimer's ) Don't have as many memory loss problems"", ""Diagnosis To find out if you have Pick's disease, your doctor will ask about your symptoms and go over your medical history. Then you'll have special tests that check your memory, behavior, language, and other mental functions. These are usually pencil and paper tests. You'll answer questions in writing and may be asked to draw certain objects. The doctor may also recommend a blood test that looks at your DNA to see if you have the gene that causes Pick's disease."", ""To get a better picture of what's happening in your brain, your doctor may order imaging tests, such as: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): Powerful magnets and radio waves are used to make detailed images of your brain. Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or a positron emission tomography (PET) scan: A radioactive substance and a special camera create 3-dimensional pictures that show what areas of your brain are more or less active. You may also have a lumbar puncture. Your doctor will use a long needle to take a small amount of fluid from an area near your spine for screening. In rare cases, your doctor might want to take a small amount of your brain tissue to test. This is called a biopsy ."", ""Treatment There's no cure for Pick's disease, and medications can't slow it down. It can progress slowly, but usually, it steadily gets worse over time. Some people live as long as 10 years with the disease. Your doctor can recommend treatment to help you deal with many of your symptoms. They may suggest behavioral therapy to help control any dangerous behavior and antidepressants to help with agitation or aggression.""]"

47,What Is a Pilonidal Cyst?,"['There’s a type of cyst you can get at the bottom of your tailbone, or coccyx. It’s called a pilonidal cyst , and it can become infected and filled with pus. Once infected, the technical term is “pilonidal abscess,” and it can be painful. It looks like a large pimple at the bottom of your tailbone. It is more common in men than in women. It usually happens more often in younger people. People who sit a lot, such as truck drivers, have a higher chance of getting one. They can be treated. If your cyst becomes a problem, your doctor can drain it or take it out through surgery.', 'What Causes a Pilonidal Cyst? Most doctors think that ingrown hairs are the reason for many of them. Pilonidal means ""nest of hair ,"" and doctors sometimes find hair follicles inside the cyst. Another theory is that pilonidal cysts appear after a trauma to that region of your body. During World War II, more than 80,000 soldiers got pilonidal cysts that put them in the hospital. People thought they were because of irritation from riding in bumpy Jeeps. For a while, the condition was called ""Jeep disease.""', 'You might be more likely to get one if you were born with a small dimple in the skin between your buttocks. This dimple can tend to get infected, though doctors aren’t exactly sure why. Other risk factors include\xa0obesity, large amounts of hair, not enough exercise, prolonged sitting, and excessive sweating.', 'Symptoms The symptoms of a pilonidal cyst include: Pain , redness, and swelling at the bottom of the spine Pus or blood draining out of it Bad smell from the pus Tenderness to the touch Fever They can vary in size. Yours may be a small dimple or cover a large, painful area.', 'When Should I Call a Doctor? A pilonidal cyst is an abscess or boil . Treatment may include antibiotics, hot compresses and topical treatment with depilatory creams. In more severe cases it needs to be drained, or lanced, to heal. Like other boils, it does not get better with antibiotics . If you have any of the symptoms, call your doctor.', 'Diagnosis Your doctor can diagnose a pilonidal cyst with a physical exam and by asking you questions about it. Among the things they may ask you: When did you first feel symptoms? Have you had this problem before? Have you had a fever? What medications or supplements do you take?', 'What Can I Do to Feel Better? Early in the infection of a pilonidal cyst, the redness, swelling, and pain may not be too bad. Some things you might want to try: To ease any pain, soak in a tub of warm water . Sometimes, your cyst may open and drain on its own this way. Take nonprescription pain medicine, but follow\xa0the dosing instructions. Keep the cyst and area around it clean and dry.', 'Treatments Antibiotics do not heal a pilonidal cyst. But doctors have any number of procedures they can try. Here are some options: Incision and drainage: This is the preferred method for a first pilonidal cyst. Your doctor makes a cut into the cyst and drains it. They remove any hair follicles and leaves the wound open, packing the space with gauze.', ""Advantage -- It’s a simple procedure done under local anesthesia, meaning just the area around the cyst is numbed. Disadvantage -- You have to change the gauze often until the cyst heals, which sometimes takes up to 3 weeks. Marsupialization: In this procedure, your doctor makes a cut and drains the cyst, removing pus and any hair that are inside. They’ll sew the edges of the cut to the wound edges to make a pouch. Advantages -- This is outpatient surgery under local anesthesia. It also lets the doctor make a smaller, shallower cut so that you don’t need to take out and repack gauze daily. Disadvantages -- It takes about 6 weeks to heal, and you need a doctor specially trained in the technique. Incision, drainage, closing of wound: In this technique, the cyst is drained, but it’s not left open. Advantage -- You don’t need to pack gauze because your doctor fully closes the wound right after surgery. Disadvantages -- You’re more likely to have more problems with the cyst down the road. It’s harder to remove the entire cyst with this method. It’s usually done in an operating room with a specially trained surgeon.' Other surgical procedures include complete cyst and cyst wall excision along with the pilonidal sinus tracts, the use of fibrin glue, and taking (core out) only diseased tissue and the cyst out with punch biopsies."", 'After Surgery Follow all of your doctor’s instructions about at-home care, especially if you need to remove and pack gauze. Other tips: Try to keep the area clean. Check for any signs of a new infection, such as redness, pus, or pain. Keep your follow-up appointments with your doctor so they can see how your cyst is healing. A complete cure is possible, but remember that a pilonidal cyst may recur even if you had one surgically removed.']"
48,Pneumonia,"['What Is Pneumonia? Pneumonia\xa0is a lung infection that can range from mild to so severe that you have to go to the hospital. It happens when an infection causes the air sacs in your\xa0lungs\xa0(your doctor will call them alveoli) to fill with fluid or pus. That can make it hard for you to breathe in enough oxygen to reach your bloodstream. Anyone can get this lung infection. But infants younger than age 2 and people over age 65 are at higher risk. That’s because their immune systems might not be strong enough to fight it. You can get pneumonia in one or both lungs. You can also have it and not know it. Doctors call this\xa0walking pneumonia. Causes include bacteria, viruses, and fungi.\xa0 If your pneumonia results from bacteria or a virus, you can spread it to someone else. Lifestyle habits, like smoking cigarettes and drinking too much alcohol, can also raise your chances of getting pneumonia.', 'Symptoms of Pneumonia Your symptoms can vary depending on what’s causing your pneumonia, your age, and your overall health. They usually develop over several days. Common pneumonia symptoms include: Chest pain when you breathe or cough Cough that produces phlegm or mucus Fatigue and loss of appetite Fever, sweating, and chills Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea Shortness of breath Along with these symptoms, older adults and people with weak immune systems might be confused or have changes in mental awareness, or they might have a lower-than-usual body temperature. Newborns and infants may not show any signs of infection. Or they might vomit, have a fever and a cough, and seem restless or tired. If you have a new cough, fever, or shortness of breath, call your doctor to ask about whether it could be COVID-19. Illness with the new coronavirus can also lead to pneumonia .', 'Causes of Pneumonia Bacteria, viruses, or fungi can cause pneumonia. Common causes include: Flu viruses Cold viruses RSV virus (the top cause of pneumonia in babies age 1 or younger) Bacteria called Streptococcus pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae', 'Some people who are in the hospital get “ventilator-associated pneumonia” if they got the infection while using a ventilator, a machine that helps you breathe. If you get pneumonia while you’re in a hospital and aren’t on a ventilator, that’s called “hospital-acquired” pneumonia. But most people get “community-acquired pneumonia,” which means they didn’t get it in a hospital.', 'Pneumonia Diagnosis Your doctor will start with questions about your symptoms and your medical history, like whether you smoke and whether you’ve been around sick people at home, school, or work. Then, they’ll listen to your lungs . If you have pneumonia, they might hear cracking, bubbling, or rumbling sounds when you breathe in. If your doctor thinks you might have pneumonia, they’ll probably give you tests, including: Blood tests to look for signs of a bacterial infection A chest X-ray to find the infection in your lungs and how far it’s spread Pulse oximetry to measure the level of oxygen in your blood A sputum test to check the fluid in your lungs for the cause of an infection If your symptoms started in the hospital or you have other health problems, your doctor might give you more tests, such as: An arterial blood gas test to measure the oxygen in a small amount of blood taken from one of your arteries Bronchoscopy to check your airways for blockages or other problems A CT scan to get a more detailed image of your lungs A pleural fluid culture, in which the doctor removes a small amount of fluid from the tissues around your lungs to look for bacteria that might cause pneumonia', 'Pneumonia Complications Pneumonia can have complications, including: Bacteremia, in which bacteria spread into your blood. This can cause septic shock and organ failure. Trouble breathing, which might mean you need to use a breathing machine while your lungs heal. Fluid buildup between the layers of tissue that line your lungs and chest cavity. This fluid can also become infected. Lung abscess, when a pocket of pus forms inside or around your lung.', 'Pneumonia Treatment Your doctor can tell you which treatment is right for you. If you have bacterial pneumonia, you’ll get antibiotics. Make sure you take all of the medicine your doctor gives you, even if you start to feel better before you’re through with it. If you have viral pneumonia, antibiotics won’t help. You’ll need to rest, drink a lot of fluids, and take medicine for your fever . If your symptoms are severe or if you have other conditions that make you more likely to have complications, your doctor may send you to the hospital. While you’re there, your doctor will probably give you fluids or antibiotics through an IV tube. You may even need oxygen therapy or breathing treatments. With any kind of pneumonia, recovery will take time. You’re going to need lots of rest. You might need a week off your usual routines, and you could still feel tired for a month.']"
49,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS),"[""What Is PCOS? Polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS) is a hormonal condition that affects your ovaries, the female reproductive organs that make eggs. It affects about 1 in every 10 women (and people assigned female at birth) who are of childbearing age. It's one of the most common causes of infertility. It can: Stop your periods or make them hard to predict Cause acne and unwanted body and facial hair Raise your risk for other health problems, including diabetes and high blood pressure Some people with PCOS have cysts (small sacs of fluid) on their ovaries. That’s why it’s called “polycystic.” But the name is a bit misleading because many people with the condition don’t have cysts. In fact, many don’t have symptoms at all. That's one reason why up to 70% of those with PCOS don’t know they have it. Polycystic ovaries are those that have lots of immature egg sac cysts (follicles). Not everyone with PCOS has ovarian cysts. (Photo credit: iStock/Getty Images) The condition starts after puberty, but may not be diagnosed until you’re trying to get pregnant. It never goes away, but symptoms usually get better after menopause. In the meantime, several treatments can relieve the symptoms or help you get pregnant."", ""PCOS vs. PCOD Polycystic ovary disease (PCOD)\xa0is another, older name for PCOS. PCOS has also been called Stein-Leventhal syndrome. Endometriosis vs. PCOS When you have endometriosis, the type of tissue that lines your uterus grows in places it shouldn't, such as your vagina or ovaries. Each month, this tissue can break down and bleed. Like PCOS, endometriosis can cause cysts in your ovaries and may lead to infertility. Its main symptoms are cramps and pain in the belly area. Unlike PCOS, it doesn't cause symptoms such as acne or excess body hair."", ""Types of PCOS Some scientists propose dividing PCOS into types based on symptoms and hormone levels: Non-hyperandrogenic PCOS, or type D: You have problems with ovulation (which can lead to irregular periods or loss of periods) and cysts on your ovaries. But your levels of androgens (male hormones) are normal. Ovulatory PCOS (type C): You have increased levels of androgens along with cysts on your ovaries. Non-PCO PCOS (type B): You have high levels of androgens as well as problems with ovulation. Full-blown PCOS (type A): You have high levels of androgens, problems with ovulation, as well as cysts on your ovaries. Informally, you might hear people describe it using other terms that refer to its causes or symptoms: Insulin-resistant PCOS. Often, those who have PCOS also have insulin resistance, which is when your body makes the hormone insulin but can't use it correctly. Insulin resistance increases your risk for type 2 diabetes. Inflammatory PCOS. Inflammation results when your immune system tries to fight off a threat. Research has linked PCOS to low levels of inflammation throughout the body. This could cause or worsen symptoms. Conditions such as insulin resistance and obesity contribute to inflammation. Hidden-cause PCOS. Some websites use this term to refer to PCOS for which the cause isn't known. But this is true of PCOS in general. Scientists don't know what causes the condition, though they believe that both your genes and environmental factors play a role. Pill-induced PCOS or post-pill PCOS. The pill and other hormonal birth control methods don't cause PCOS. But when you stop using this type of birth control, you could temporarily have irregular periods or other symptoms that look like those of PCOS. Hormonal birth control can also mask the symptoms of PCOS. So you might not be diagnosed with it until you go off birth control. Doctors sometimes prescribe hormonal birth control to treat PCOS symptoms."", ""PCOS and Hormones Your body makes many types of hormones. Hormones are chemical messengers that help control many body functions. Some affect your menstrual cycle and are tied to your ability to have a baby.\xa0When you have PCOS, your reproductive hormones are out of balance. Several hormones play a role in PCOS. PCOS insulin resistance Insulin is a hormone that manages your blood sugar levels. Scientists estimate that 30%-80% of those with PCOS have insulin resistance. When your body doesn't react to insulin as it should, you can end up with too much insulin in your body. Some researchers think this excess insulin plays a role in causing your body to overproduce androgens. Other hormones involved in the syndrome include: Androgens. They’re often called male hormones, but everyone has them. When you have PCOS, your ovaries make more androgens than usual. This can keep your ovaries from releasing eggs on their monthly schedule and cause irregular periods.\xa0Extra androgens are responsible for many PCOS symptoms, including acne, hair loss, and unwanted hair growth. Follicle-stimulating hormone. This hormone helps prepare your body for ovulation and helps control your menstrual cycle. Luteinizing hormone. This also helps regulate your monthly cycle, triggering your ovaries to release eggs . Progesterone. With PCOS, your body may not have enough of this hormone. So you might miss periods for a long time or have trouble predicting when they’ll come. Estrogen. When you have PCOS, your levels of estrogen may be too high in relation to your progesterone levels."", ""PCOS Symptoms What are the first signs of PCOS? Polycystic ovary syndrome isn't actually a disease but a set of symptoms. These symptoms can vary from person to person. But the most common signs of PCOS are missed, irregular, infrequent, or too-long periods. Other possible signs of PCOS include: Hair loss . PCOS can cause the hair on your head to get thinner, especially if you're middle-aged or older . Excess face and body h air (hirsutism). At the same time, hair may grow in places you don’t want it, like your face, chest, belly, arms, fingers, and toes. Oily skin. Extra androgens can lead to oilier skin. Acne. You might have breakouts on your face, chest, and/or back. Darkened skin. Patches of skin that look darker than the surrounding area can show up under your breasts or arms, or on your neck. Skin tags. These little flaps of excess skin most often appear on your neck or armpits. PCOS pain. You may have pain in your lower-belly (pelvic) area during your period and occasionally at other times. Weight gain (PCOS belly) . About 50% of those with PCOS have weight gain, especially in the abdominal (belly) area. Ovarian cysts. When you have an ultrasound, your doctor might notice that your ovaries look bigger or have lots of egg sac cysts (follicles). Mood changes. PCOS raises your risk of mood swings and feelings of depression or anxiety. This can be caused by hormonal changes as well as the strain of dealing with PCOS symptoms."", ""Can you have PCOS without symptoms? Sometimes, PCOS doesn't cause any symptoms, or they're so minor that you don't notice them. For that reason, and because many other issues can cause similar period problems, it may take a while to get a PCOS diagnosis."", ""PCOS Causes Doctors don’t know exactly what causes the syndrome. But things that are thought to be involved include: Excess weight. The link between weight and PCOS is complicated. Weight gain plays a role in the development of the condition. But PCOS can also contribute to weight gain. High levels of androgens. This condition, called hyperandrogenism, affects most people with PCOS. Insulin resistance . Extra insulin can affect your ovaries and their ability to release eggs (ovulate). It can also make it easier to gain weight and harder to lose it. Long-term, low-grade inflammation . This also contributes to your body's overproduction of androgens. Is PCOS genetic? The genetic link to PCOS isn't clear, but you're more likely to get it if your close relatives also have it. Some 20%-40% of those with PCOS have a mother or sister with the condition. This may be related to similar lifestyles as well as to genes."", 'PCOS Risk Factors Risk factors for PCOS include: A family history of menstrual problems or disorders (including PCOS) Type 2 diabetes Being overweight or obese Fast weight gain Transgender men (also known as female-to-male transsexual people, or FTMs) are prone to PCOS. Hormone therapy may or may not be a reason for that, as so many other factors come into play. Some studies have shown that while hormone therapy can cause changes to the ovaries of transgender men, it doesn’t necessarily cause PCOS.', ""What Are the Complications of PCOS? When you have PCOS, you have higher odds of having several other health problems, such as: Trouble getting pregnant. Hormonal imbalances can interfere with ovulation . If no healthy egg is available to be fertilized by a sperm , you can’t get pregnant . However, you may still be able to get pregnant despite having PCOS. For that, you might need to take medicine and work with a fertility specialist. Pregnancy complications. Most people with PCOS can have a healthy pregnancy. But the condition raises your risk for diabetes (gestational diabetes) and high blood pressure (preeclampsia) during pregnancy. It also increases the risk of preterm delivery, a cesarean section delivery, and miscarriage. Insulin issues and diabetes. When you have insulin resistance, the cells in your muscles, organs, and other tissues don’t absorb blood sugar very well. So you end up with excess sugar in your bloodstream. Insulin resistance doesn't usually cause symptoms until blood sugar levels get so high that you have diabetes. More than half of those with PCOS will get type 2 diabetes by the time they're 40. Metabolic syndrome. This group of symptoms raises your risk of cardiovascular disease. The symptoms include high triglyceride and low HDL (“good”) cholesterol levels , high blood pressure , and high blood sugar levels . Other possible complications include: Depression Anxiety Bleeding from the uterus and a higher risk of uterine and endometrial cancers Sleep problems, including sleep apnea Inflammation of the liver"", ""PCOS Diagnosis You may be diagnosed with PCOS if you have at least two of these symptoms: Periods that aren't regular Signs your body is making extra androgens, such as acne, excess facial and body hair, or a blood test that shows high androgen levels Ovarian cysts or enlarged ovaries that show up on an ultrasound How to get tested for PCOS No single test can diagnose PCOS. Your doctor will start by asking about your symptoms and medical history. They'll do a physical exam to look for symptoms such as acne and facial and body hair. They may also do a pelvic exam. For this test, they place a gloved hand inside your vagina, then feel your reproductive organs to see if your ovaries are enlarged or if there are other abnormalities. They may also do an ultrasound, an imaging test that shows them whether you have cysts and measures the lining of your uterus. For a transvaginal ultrasound, your doctor places a wand in your vagina that uses sound waves to create images of your reproductive organs."", ""You might also have a blood test to check your levels of androgens and other hormones. Other tests you might get If your doctor thinks you have PCOS, they may want you to get checked for other health conditions that aren't linked to PCOS. This might involve: Blood pressure testing Blood tests for sugar, cholesterol, and triglyceride levels Mental health screening Screening for sleep apnea"", ""PCOS Treatment There's no cure for PCOS. The medical treatment that your doctor recommends to manage your symptoms depends on whether you're trying to get pregnant.\xa0It's important to talk to your doctor about this because certain medications can harm a developing baby. They might prescribe: Hormonal birth control. If you aren’t planning to get pregnant, your doctor might prescribe hormonal birth control, such as the patch, pill, shot, or hormonal IUD. They might contain estrogen, progesterone, or both. They can get your periods on track, help with acne and extra body hair, and lower your risk of endometrial cancer. Progestin therapy. This hormone can help normalize your menstrual cycle and reduce your odds of uterine cancer. It doesn't prevent pregnancy or reduce levels of androgens. Insulin-sensitizing medications . Metformin, a drug used to treat type 2 diabetes, helps lower insulin and androgen levels. While it's not FDA-approved to treat PCOS, it can help with ovulation and period problems. Androgen blockers . These drugs block the effects of the extra male hormones that cause issues such as unwanted hair growth and acne. But don't take them if you're pregnant or plan to get pregnant, because they can cause birth defects. While you're on them, you should use two different types of birth control."", ""Acne medications If you have acne that bothers you, a dermatologist can prescribe creams and/or pills to treat and prevent breakouts. Excessive hair growth If you want to reduce facial or body hair, other options include: Electrolysis or laser therapy : Electrolysis removes individual hairs with an electric current that destroys the root. Laser therapy destroys hair follicles. You'll need several sessions. While some hair may come back, it should be finer and less noticeable.

The surgeon makes a small cut in your belly and removes the parts of your ovaries that make too many androgens. In vitro fertilization, or IVF: In this procedure, your doctor removes one of your eggs from your body and combines it with sperm from your partner or a donor. They then place the fertilized egg back inside your uterus. This may be the most effective way to get pregnant when you have PCOS, but it can be expensive.

But losing weight isn't easy. A nutritionist or dietitian may be able to help. Also, some people find that keeping a journal or using an app to track meals and snacks can make things easier. PCOS diet To manage your blood sugar, your doctor may suggest focusing on foods that are lower in sugar and certain carbohydrates (carbs). Some carbs are good for you, such as those in high-fiber vegetables and fruits. But it's best to limit refined carbs, such as those found in white flour, white rice, white potatoes, sugar, and highly processed foods. These foods have a high glycemic index, which means they make your blood sugar rise quickly."", 'Other healthy foods, such as poultry and other lean meats, fish, and whole grains, can help with your blood sugar levels, too. Try to have regular meals, as sticking to a schedule helps your body maintain consistent insulin levels. Exercising Regular exercise burns calories and increases muscle mass. This can help decrease insulin resistance, which can lower your androgen levels and help with symptoms. Exercise can also boost your mood and self-esteem. Getting enough sleep Lack of sleep can play a role in hormone imbalances, insulin resistance, and weight gain. Set the stage for restful sleep by: Going to sleep and waking up at about the same time each day Avoiding screens close to bedtime Making sure your bedroom is dark, cool, and quiet If you often have trouble getting at least 7 hours of sleep a night, talk to your doctor.', 'Reducing stress A condition such as PCOS can be stressful. In turn, stress might make PCOS symptoms worse. Y our body makes cortisol (the so-called stress hormone) from progesterone and other hormones.

50,"Polymyositis: Causes, Symptoms, and Treatment","['What Is Polymyositis? Polymyositis is a type of disease called an inflammatory myopathy, which means that it irritates the muscles that help you move. Polymyositis also damages nearby tissues, such as the blood vessels that supply oxygen and nutrients to your muscles. It usually affects the muscles in your thighs and upper arms. It causes muscle weakness and pain on both sides of your body and makes it hard to do everyday things, such as climbing stairs and getting out of a chair. There’s no cure for this ongoing (chronic) condition, but there are treatments that can help with symptoms. Polymyositis vs. dermatomyositis Polymyositis is related to another inflammatory disease called dermatomyositis. Both conditions cause muscle weakness and soreness, but dermatomyositis also causes a rash. This rash could be smooth or scaly and might not be near the weakened muscles. Dermatomyositis also might lead to swelling around your eyes or fingernails. Polymyositis vs. polymyalgia rheumatica Polymyositis shares many symptoms with a condition called polymyalgia rheumatica. These conditions can impact muscles on both sides of your body, particularly near the abdomen. The biggest difference is that polymyalgia rheumatica tends to cause muscle pain and stiffness, but polymyositis causes pain and weakness. Polymyositis is a disease that inflames your muscles. It can cause you to feel weak and achy and have trouble with everyday activities.

This is when your immune system, which usually protects you against foreign invaders such as viruses, makes a mistake and attacks your own tissues instead. It might be an inherited condition, which means it's passed down through families. You are at a higher risk of getting polymyositis if you have an autoimmune condition such as: Lupus Rheumatoid arthritis Scleroderma Sjogren’s syndrome It’s also more common among people with HIV or AIDS. Most people who have polymyositis get diagnosed between the ages of 30 and 60.

EMG (electromyography) : This is used to check if the patterns of electrical impulses in your muscles are normal or not. MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): This uses a magnet to scan and create images of large areas of your muscle. Muscle biopsy : Your doctor will take a small sample of your muscle for testing to see if the muscle tissue is inflamed.', ""Polymyositis Treatment Polymyositis is a chronic condition. That means that once you have it, it sticks around. But there are ways to help manage it. Polymyositis medications These medications can help with polymyositis: Corticosteroids. These are the first medicines used to treat polymyositis. They lower inflammation and ease pain. Drugs that suppress the immune system (immunosuppressants). These medicines help your immune system stop attacking your body's tissues. There are many different kinds of immunosuppressants, such as azathioprine (Imuran® and Azasan®), methotrexate (Rheumatrex® and Trexall®), and rituximab (Rituxan). Therapeutic treatments In addition to medicine, your doctor may also suggest some of these therapies, depending on your symptoms: Physical therapy. A physical therapist will guide you through helpful exercises. These exercises will make you stronger and help you move better. Speech therapy. Polymyositis can weaken the muscles you use to speak. A speech therapist can help with your pronunciation so you can speak more clearly. Dietetic assessment. Over time, muscle weakness can make it difficult to chew and swallow. A nutritionist or registered dietitian can help you plan soft and nutritious meals."", 'Other treatments Some people with polymyositis benefit from regular blood infusions. During this procedure, a medical professional will use an IV to give you antibodies called immunoglobulins. These healthy antibodies help protect your muscles from autoimmune attacks. If you have difficulty moving, braces and other special devices can help.', 'Polymyositis Complications Complications that might come along with polymyositis include: Trouble swallowing: This could happen if the muscles in your esophagus are affected. It can lead to weight loss and malnutrition. Aspiration pneumonia: When you can’t swallow well, you’re more likely to breathe food or liquid (including saliva ) into your lungs . This can cause pneumonia. Breathing problems : If your chest muscles are affected, you could have shortness of breath, and possibly respiratory failure. Digestion problems: If the muscles in your digestive tract are weakened, you might have problems digesting food. This can also cause malnutrition. Falls: Weak muscles can cause you to fall and break bones. Polymyositis is also linked to other health problems. It doesn’t necessarily cause these conditions, but it can increase your risk for them. These include: Heart disease Lung disease Cancer Other connective tissue diseases, such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis', 'Prognosis for Polymyositis The prognosis for polymyositis depends on how severe a case you have. Most people respond to treatment and get some of their muscle strength back. Some weakness may remain, and your symptoms could come back. While the condition is rarely life-threatening, you could become disabled if you don’t get proper treatment.', ""Takeaways Polymyositis causes your immune system to attack your body's tissues. The main symptoms are muscle weakness and pain, which can make it difficult to climb stairs, lift heavy objects, or carry out other daily activities. There’s no cure, but certain therapies can help manage symptoms and keep your muscles strong. Talk to your doctor about the best treatments for you."", 'Polymyositis FAQs What are the major symptoms of polymyositis? This condition causes muscle weakness. It usually affects muscles near the abdomen (such as the neck, upper back, upper arms, shoulders, hips, and thighs) across both sides of your body. Muscle aches, fatigue, and fever are other common symptoms.', 'What is the most common cause of polymyositis? It’s not clear what causes polymyositis. Some researchers think it might be linked to autoimmune disorders, which cause your immune system to fight your healthy cells as if they were invading germs. What is the life expectancy of polymyositis? Polymyositis is a condition you will have your whole life. With the right treatment, you can feel better. But there is a risk of death. About 1 in 10 people who have polymyositis die from it or related diseases. What does a polymyositis flare-up feel like? Polymyositis makes your muscles feel very weak. It might lead to difficulty moving, breathing, or swallowing. You could also feel aches and fatigue.']"
51,Porn Addiction,"['What Is a Porn Addiction? Porn addiction is, in theory, when you can’t stop looking at porn, even if you want to. And the obsession gets to the point that it interferes with work, relationships, and other parts of daily life. It’s easy to understand how this could be a problem with the widespread availability of internet porn today. In 2019, for example, the popular site PornHub recorded 42 billion visits -- that’s 115 million a day.', 'Is Porn Addictive? Scientists are debating if heavy use of pornography is an addiction in the medical sense of the word. The World Health Organization added compulsive sexual behavior as a mental health disorder in 2018. And while it doesn’t single out a pornography (or any other) addiction, it does refer to repetitive sexual activities becoming a central focus of a person’s life to the point that they neglect their “health and personal care or other interests, activities, and responsibilities.” And a study of men who sought treatment for problematic pornography use (PPU) showed that their brains did respond to sexual images.', 'That gives credence to experts who say that the same brain activity shown in drug or alcohol addiction -- when circuits in your brain associated with reward, motivation, and memory get turned on -- is in those who use pornography a lot. But porn addiction isn’t recognized in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders . That’s the book doctors use to diagnose mental disorders. And some study results dispute the idea that porn is related to addiction. One group of researchers found that watching porn didn’t activate the parts of the brain usually involved with addiction. In fact, brain activity in those areas decreased. Other scientists point out that studies so far have either been poorly organized or have struggled with defining what exactly would make this an actual addiction. Plus, some say it’s difficult to get a handle on how widespread the problem is, in part, because few users think the habit is a problem. Neither does the American Association of Sexuality Educators, Counselors and Therapists. The group says there’s little proof that either sex addition or porn addition are problems. In a position statement on the topic, the group cautions against making consensual sexual behavior a disorder.', 'Porn Addiction Signs Whether it’s an addiction or not, those who use pornography regularly have intense urges or cravings for sex. They turn to porn when they’re anxious. They also tend to struggle at work and at home. Some experts believe there’s a link between heavy use of porn and dissatisfaction with relationships . Definitions about how much porn is too much vary. But most experts agree that if it gets in the way of your day-to-day activities, you could be watching too much. For example, if: Porn becomes a central part of your life. You stop doing things you really enjoy so that you can see more of it. You neglect personal care. You lose interest in other activities. You become less interested in social encounters. It damages your relationships. You let go of other responsibilities. It affects your job or schoolwork. You’re looking at it or watching it in places that aren’t appropriate, like work or school. Your sex life starts to be unfulfilling. You have a craving for more. You can’t stop looking at or watching porn, even when you try. You can’t quit even though you don’t enjoy it as much. You’ve been heavily looking at or watching porn for 6 months or more.', 'Porn Addiction Causes and Risk Factors Because porn addiction is controversial in the medical/mental health community, there’s not a clear set of causes available. But there may be some clues in the causes of compulsive sexual behavior. Things that lead to porn addiction could include: A brain chemical imbalance. Chemicals like serotonin and norepinephrine control your moods. High levels are often tied to compulsive sexual behavior, like heavy porn use. Brain pathway changes. If you do get addicted, it could change the way circuits in your brain work. An addiction means you’ll have to view porn over and over again to get the same level of enjoyment. Brain disease. Conditions like epilepsy and dementia, and treatment for Parkinson’s with dopamine, can damage the part of your brain that controls sexual behavior.', 'Things that could make porn addition more likely include: Ease of access. Thanks to the internet, access to porn is a click away. Privacy. Viewing porn in private is easier than ever. Compulsive behaviors thrive in secrecy. Compulsive sexual behavior like porn addiction could also be more likely if you have: Drug or alcohol and use problems, or family members who have them Other mental health issues such as a mood disorder like depression or a gambling addiction Family conflict A history of physical or sexual abuse', 'Porn Addiction Treatment and Home Remedies There is help if you feel your pornography habits are causing problems. The main type of treatment for compulsive sexual behavior is psychotherapy. You could try: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) a type of psychotherapy or talk therapy . You’ll work with a mental health professional to identify problem areas in your life and learn ways to overcome them. Acceptance and commitment therapy is a form of CBT that emphasizes accepting your thoughts and urges and a committing to actions that are more in line with other values. Psychodynamic psychotherapy focuses on becoming more aware of unconscious thoughts and behaviors, learning about your motivations, and resolving conflicts. Medications can help control brain chemicals linked to obsessive thoughts and actions. They include: Antidepressants. Drugs that treat depression, anxiety, or obsessive-compulsive disorder may help. Naltrexone (Vivitrol) . This medication is used to treat alcohol and opiate dependence. It blocks the part of your brain that gets pleasure from addictive behaviors. Mood stabilizers. Used for conditions like bipolar disorder, they may reduce compulsive sexual urges. Anti-androgens. These medications dull the effects of male sex hormones (androgens). They reduce men’s sexual urges.', 'You can also look into self-help and support group like Sex Addicts Anonymous or Sexaholics Anonymous. In addition to having people who understand what you’re going through, they can also point you to mental health professionals trained in dealing with excessive porn use. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration Treatment Referral Helpline at 800-662-HELP (800-662-4357) can point you to professionals in your area who can help.', 'Porn Addiction Complications Not getting help for a porn addiction could lead to problems like: Guilt, shame, and low self-esteem Mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts Neglecting your partner Damaging relationships Losing of focus at work Job loss from watching internet porn at work Debt from buying porn Troubles with substance abuse']"
52,PET Scan (Positron Emission Tomography),"['What Is a PET Scan? A PET scan (also known as positron emission tomography and PET/CT) is a type of imaging study that can show doctors what’s happening in your body and how it’s working. It’s different from an X-ray, CT, or MRI . They all provide images, but a PET scan shows how your body’s working. It provides information about blood flow and how your body’s using oxygen and sugar. That can give important clues about how a disease is unfolding. When you get a PET scan, your doctor first gives you a radioactive substance called a radiotracer (or just “tracer”). The tracer gives off radiation , which the PET scan machine picks up on. The images you get show where in your body the tracer goes. If it builds up in certain areas, that could be a sign of disease.', 'What Is a PET Scan Used For? A PET scan can help doctors test for disease, prepare for surgery, and see how well treatments are working. You might get one for several reasons, but they’re most often used with cancer , heart disease , and brain conditions.', 'Your doctor may use a PET scan to: Find cancer See if cancer has spread Check if cancer treatment is working Determine if cancer came back after treatment With heart disease , your doctor might use a PET scan to: Check blood flow to your heart muscles Help decide the best treatment for clogged arteries Look at the effects of a heart attack Your doctor may also use it to check for brain conditions, such as: Alzheimer ’s disease Parkinson’s disease Seizures Stroke Tumors', 'How Do PET Scans Differ from CT and MRI Scans? Doctors use different types of imaging for different reasons. Often, you start with an X-ray because it’s a quick way to get basic information. But if you need finer detail, you might then get a CT scan or MRI. Many doctors use MRI/PET and CT/PET hybrid scanners, which combines the two tools into a single scan. This allows doctors to do either a CT or MRI scan in combination with a PET scan all at once. A PET scan can show what’s actually happening in your cells. One reason that’s important is because early on, some diseases don’t cause changes you can see with an MRI or CT scan. But they do cause changes in how your cells are working. That means a PET scan might help your doctor find a disease that other types of imaging can’t.', 'How Do I Prepare for a PET Scan? First, you’ll need to tell your doctor about any of the following: Allergies , especially to contrast dye, iodine, or seafood Health conditions, like diabetes , or any illnesses you’ve had recently Medicines, herbs, and supplements you take If you’re a woman, tell your doctor if you’re: Breastfeeding -- you may need to pump milk because you can’t breastfeed until the tracer is out of your body. Check with your doctor to see how long you should wait. Pregnant or think you might be -- the tracer can harm your baby, so talk to your doctor about the best options for you. Your doctor will give you specific directions to prepare for your scan. Be sure to follow them closely. Often you’ll need to: Avoid intense physical activity for 24 hours before the scan Drink only water and avoid eating for several hours prior to the scan Remove all piercings , jewelry, and metal objects from your body', 'What Is the PET Scan Procedure Like? It depends where and why you get the scan, but typically, you: Change into a hospital gown Go to the bathroom Get the tracer -- depending on the type, you’ll either swallow it, breathe it in, or get it through a needle Wait 30 minutes to an hour for your body to absorb the tracer Lie very still on your back while images are taken. It’s important not to move or talk during the scan, which may last up to an hour. The PET scan machine is a big, open circle -- like a standing donut -- with a table that moves in and out of it. If you have a fear of tight, closed spaces, you may get a drug to help keep you calm. You’ll hear the machine buzz and click as it takes images. The scan itself is painless. For some people, staying still for so long is the hardest part and may cause some aches or discomfort. After the scan, drink plenty of fluids to help flush the tracer out of your body. Your doctor may suggest you avoid close contact with pregnant women, kids, or babies for a few hours since you’ll be radioactive for a short time.\xa0Within a few hours or days after the PET scan, the radioactive material within the tracer will decay and will no longer be radioactive. You’ll pass it out of your body in urine and stool.', 'PET Scan Risks and Side Effects A PET scan is painless and has few risks and side effects. But you may have discomfort or problems, such as: Pain or redness where a tracer is injected A hard time fitting into the PET/CT machine if you are overweight Claustrophobia, if you are unable to be in enclosed spaces Allergic reactions to a tracer, although this rarely happens and may be a mild reaction Inaccurate test results among people with diabetes whose blood sugar levels or insulin levels aren’t within the right range during the test Your exposure to radioactive material is very low but non nonexistent.', 'PET Scan Follow-Up and Results A PET scan shows bright areas where there’s heavy activity in your cells, which may be a sign of disease. To get a more complete picture of what’s going on, your doctor may compare your PET scan with results from other imaging you’ve had. Test results are very accurate, but a combined PET/CT tends to be more accurate than the results of either test on its own. You can get results within 24 hours, but it depends on where you have the scan done.']"
53,Polio Vaccine (IPV),"['Polio , an infectious disease caused by a virus that lives in the throat and intestinal tract , was once the leading cause of disability in the U.S. Since the introduction of the polio vaccine in 1955, the disease has been eradicated in the U.S. But the disease is still common in some developing countries and until it is eradicated worldwide, the risk of it spreading to the U.S. still exists. For that reason, the polio vaccination remains one of the recommended childhood immunizations. In most parts of the U.S., polio immunization is required before a child can start school.', 'How the Polio Vaccination Is Given If you had the polio vaccination prior to 2000, you may have received the oral polio vaccine (OPV), which was made from a live poliovirus. Although the live virus vaccine was highly effective at protecting against polio, a few cases of polio per year were caused by the oral vaccine itself. In 2000, the U.S. switched to the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV). Using an inactive (dead) form of the virus that cannot cause polio, the IPV is given as a shot in the arm or leg.', ""Who Needs the Polio Vaccine Most people should get the polio vaccine when they are children. Children should be vaccinated with four doses of IPV at the following ages: A dose at 2 months A dose at 4 months A dose at 6-18 months A booster dose at 4-6 years IPV may be given at the same time as other vaccinations. Because most adults were vaccinated as children, routine polio vaccination is not recommended for people ages 18 and older who live in the U.S. But three groups of adults at higher risk for coming into contact with the poliovirus should consider polio vaccination. They are: Travelers to other parts of the world where polio is still common People who work in labs handling specimens that might contain polioviruses Health care workers who have close contact with a person who could be infected with the poliovirus If you fall into any of these three groups you should speak to your health care provider about the polio vaccination. If you have never been vaccinated against polio, you should get three doses of IPV: The first dose at any time The second dose 1 to 2 months later The third dose 6 to 12 months after the second If you have had one or two doses of polio vaccine in the past you should get the remaining one or two doses. It doesn't matter how long it has been since the earlier dose or doses."", 'Who Should Not Get the Polio Vaccine You should not receive the polio vaccine if: You have had a severe allergic reaction from a previous dose of the polio vaccine You have had a severe allergic reaction to the antibiotics streptomycin , polymyxin B, or neomycin Although no side effects have been reported in pregnant women who have received the vaccine, pregnant women should avoid the vaccine if possible. Pregnant women who fall into one of the groups of adults listed above should speak with their doctors about receiving an IPV according to the recommended schedule for adults. People who are moderately or severely ill should usually wait until they have recovered before receiving the vaccine.', ""Risks and Side Effects of Polio Vaccination Some people who get the polio shot get a sore, red spot where the shot was given, but otherwise the vaccine is very safe. Most people don't have any problems with it at all. However, the polio vaccine, like any medicine, could potentially cause serious problems, such as a severe allergic reaction. The risk that the vaccine could cause any serious harm is extremely small.""]"
54,What Is Prader-Willi Syndrome?,"['Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare, complicated condition that affects many parts of your body. It stems from a problem with one of your chromosomes (a strand of DNA that carries your genes). It can cause physical issues, like extreme hunger and weak muscles, as well as learning and behavioral problems. Only about 1 in 10,000 to 30,000 people in the world have PWS.', ""Causes PWS usually happens because of genetic changes on a region of chromosome 15. There's no way to prevent it. But if you plan to have a baby, you and your partner can be screened for PWS risk. A head or brain injury can also cause the syndrome."", 'Signs and Symptoms A baby may show signs of PWS early on. They may have almond-shaped eyes , their head may get narrow at the temples, their\xa0mouth might turn down at the corners, and they might have a thin upper lip. He also may have these symptoms: Poor muscle tone or limbs that hang loosely when you hold them Inability to suck or nurse well, so they gain\xa0weight slowly Eyes that cross or wander Appearance of being tired all the time Weak or soft cry Poor response to you', ""In early childhood, kids with PWS start to show other signs. It affects a part of their brain called the hypothalamus -- this is what tells you you're full when you eat enough food. People with PWS don't get the feeling of being full, so the most common signs are nonstop hunger and weight gain. A child with PWS may always want more food, eat big portions , or try to hide or store food to eat later. Some kids even eat food that's still frozen or in the garbage. Your child may also: Be short for their age Have small hands or feet Have extra body fat and not enough muscle mass Have sex organs that may not develop Have mild to moderate learning problems Be slow to learn to talk, sit, stand, or walk Have temper tantrums Pick at their skin Have sleep problems Have mood and speech problems Have scoliosis -- a curved spine Have too little thyroid or growth hormones"", ""These signs of PWS are less common, but some people have them: Vision problems, like being nearsighted Lighter skin and hair color than the rest of the family High tolerance for pain Inability to keep body temperature under control during a fever or in a hot or cold place Thick saliva that can cause tooth decay or other problems Osteoporosis, or thin, weak bones that break easily Because their sex organs don't develop, women with PWS may never get a period. Or they may start their periods much later than others. Men who have PWS may not have facial hair. They may have small sex organs, and their voices may not change in puberty. People who have PWS usually aren't able to have children."", ""Diagnosis Your doctor can usually diagnose PWS with a blood test called a chromosomal analysis. This shows if there's a problem with the gene that can cause PWS."", ""Treatments There's no cure, but if you have a child with PWS, you can help them stay at a healthy weight, have a good quality of life, and prevent health problems down the road. Their treatment will depend on the symptoms. Babies : High-calorie formula may help an infant stay at a healthy weight if they can't eat well because of weak muscle tone. You also can use special nipples or a Gavage feeding tube, which puts breast milk or formula directly in your baby's stomach , to make sure they get\xa0enough food. Older kids and teens: Set clear limits on how and when your child eats to avoid too much weight gain. A low-calorie, balanced diet and lots of exercise can help them stay at a healthy weight. Some kids with PWS may need to take extra vitamin D or calcium ."", 'If your child tries to grab and hide food, you might lock cabinets, the pantry, or the refrigerator. For teens with PWS, hormones like testosterone, estrogen , or human growth hormone (HGH) may help with small stature, poor muscle tone, or extra body fat. Hormone replacement may build stronger bones and prevent osteoporosis later on.', ""Antidepressants , like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), may help ease behavior problems caused by PWS. Specialized therapy can help your child deal with sleep apnea, thyroid issues, and other symptoms common to this condition. Kids with PWS should get regular eye exams to check for vision problems. Your child's doctor should screen for scoliosis, hip dysplasia, or thyroid problems . The Prader-Willi Syndrome Association has online support groups and tips for parents.""]"
55,Can Spiritual/Religious Practice Improve Your Health?,"['Traditional Western medicine hasn’t typically concerned itself with spiritual well-being. But that might be changing as a growing body of evidence shows spiritual and religious practice can have profound health effects, especially in regard to mental health.', 'Your Brain on Spirituality and Religion Higher levels of spirituality and religiousness are associated with lower levels of depression, suicide, and substance misuse in any number of studies. Sustained spiritual practice (going to church, praying, meditating, helping others) may also guard against posttraumatic stress disorder and boost psychological growth after a stressful situation, research shows. These practices can help you feel “loved and held” during times of despair, says Lisa Miller, PhD, founder of the Spirituality Mind Body Institute at Teachers College, Columbia University. Lisa Miller, PhD People who find meaning and purpose through their spirituality often emerge from hard times feeling better prepared to handle the next horrible thing that might happen, she says. And it’s not simply mental health. People who regularly attend religious services are less likely to end up in the hospital for any reason. And when they do, they’re hospitalized for less time, studies show. Even the sickest among us can benefit. Among people with cancer, no matter how severe, those with a spiritual practice report a better quality of life.', 'In some cases, scientists can see changes in the brain. For example, certain regions of the brain linked to emotion, insight, and transcendent awareness light up when people have religious or spiritual experiences or think back on them, says Miller. And parts of the brain that appear thin when people are chronically depressed often appear thick when people who say spirituality is important to them engage in spiritual practices during and after recovery, she says, a topic she writes about in “The Awakened Brain: The New Science of Spirituality and our Quest for an Inspired life.” It may be these brain changes themselves buffer against certain mental health problems, Miller says, but the research is not yet clear. What is clear, says Miller, is that simple belief is not enough. It’s important to maintain a spiritual practice to reap the full benefits. (In this way it is similar to other behavioral interventions, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, for which consistent practice is key.) One study looked at people who remained spiritual for 8 years. In that study, those who had a “spiritual awakening” through things like self-reflection, prayer, meditation, or service and maintained the practice were less likely to get depressed down the road, she says.', 'What’s God Got to Do With It? Your spirituality doesn’t have to be overtly religious, says Miller. It can simply be a connection to “a higher power” or to “the transcendent.” Some people think of it simply as “something greater than yourself.” This can range from a traditional conception of God to connection with the universe, artworks, nature, or even other people, according to studies. Brandon Vaidyanathan, PhD “This natural spiritual awareness has a universal neural pathway,” Miller says. “So, it doesn’t matter if I’m spiritual but not religious or if I’m Christian, Catholic, Muslim, Jewish, Hindu. We all have the same spiritual brains, which is beautiful.” It could just mean, “I’m not a robot and I have deep emotions, and I care about humanity and the planet,” says Brandon Vaidyanathan, PhD, associate professor and chair of sociology at The Catholic University of America in Washington D.C. Formal beliefs and practices aren’t required. You can practice gratitude and compassion, volunteer in your community, or spend time in nature. If you’re moved by music, poetry, or watching a sunset, then do more of that, he says.', 'Or tap into the spirituality of scientists and marvel at the beauty and wonder in the natural world around you. “Astronomers might be the first people to see the light of a particular star, and that is a profoundly important moment that can be a spiritual experience,” Vaidyanathan says. “Just as somebody watching a protein under a microscope might be in awe of this phenomenon of life that they’re seeing unfolding in front of them.”', 'The Effect of Community “Some of the language around spirituality can be very individualistic,” Vaidyanathan says. “But we are social creatures. We need other people. We need a place to belong.” That may be why religiousness seems to have a more robust effect on well-being compared to spirituality alone. At least that’s what Vaidyanathan and his colleagues found when they surveyed a group of scientists about their mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. “When you go to a temple or a mosque or a church and you’re together with people, there’s a sense of belonging, which is kind of the antidote to loneliness,” Vaidyanathan says. “And just sitting and meditating in a room by yourself isn’t going to give you that.”', 'Joining a meditation group or other non-religious spiritual community might accomplish the same thing, though more research is needed to be sure, he says. It\'s important to note that not everyone’s experience with religious or spiritual community is positive. Studies show you may have more anxiety, depression, or overall stress and distress if you feel guilty, abandoned, or punished by your God or your community. “And if you’re in a religious community where there’s a lot of politics, a lot of tension, and a lot of infighting and backbiting,” Vaidyanathan says, ""I guarantee you’ll find higher levels of stress and anxiety in those populations.”', ""Integrating Spiritual and Medical Practice Anna Yusim, MD Some practitioners already fold individual religious or spiritual practice into cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Studies show this can be an\xa0effective way to manage a variety of mental health problems, particularly addiction, chronic depression, and trauma. But It's not always easy to find this kind of treatment. “There’s definitely an unmet need, especially when it comes to things like depression and mental health,” says psychiatrist Anna Yusim, MD, a clinical assistant professor at Yale School of Medicine. Yusim is helping develop the forthcoming Center for Mental Health and Spirituality, which will be “a bridge between Yale Medical School and Yale Divinity School,” she says."", 'Yusim integrates various religious and spiritual practices in her treatment protocols for patients. If it’s part of their core beliefs, she’ll integrate prayer, sacred texts, or religious services into treatment. For those without a particular religious conviction, she uses other approaches such as meditation, yoga, and breath work, which have proven “very powerful and transformative” in her practice, Yusim says. “Spiritual needs are a very core and integral part of one’s being,” Yusim says. “And that part has to be engaged in order for the person to feel whole and complete. It’s not the only thing that needs to be there, but it certainly is one of those things.”']"
56,Amyloidosis,"['Amyloidosis is when an abnormal protein called amyloid builds up in your tissues and organs. When it does, it affects their shape and how they work. Amyloidosis is a serious health problem that can lead to life-threatening organ failure.', 'Causes and Types of Amyloidosis Many different proteins can lead to amyloid deposits, but only a few have been linked to major health problems. The type of protein and where it collects tells the type of amyloidosis you have. Amyloid deposits may collect throughout your body or in just one area. The different types of amyloidosis include: AL amyloidosis (immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis). This is the most common type and used to be called primary amyloidosis. AL stands for “amyloid light chains,” which is the type of protein responsible for the condition. There’s no known cause, but it happens when your bone marrow makes abnormal antibodies that can’t be broken down. It’s linked with a blood cancer called multiple myeloma. It can affect your kidneys, heart, liver, intestines, and nerves.', ""AA amyloidosis. Previously known as secondary amyloidosis, this condition is the result of another chronic infectious or inflammatory disease such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn’s disease, or ulcerative colitis. It mostly affects your kidneys, but it can also affect your digestive tract, liver, and heart. AA means the amyloid type A protein causes this type. Dialysis-related amyloidosis (DRA). This is more common in older adults and people who have been on dialysis for more than 5 years. This form of amyloidosis is caused by deposits of beta-2 microglobulin that build up in the blood. Deposits can build up in many different tissues, but it most commonly affects bones, joints, and tendons. Familial, or hereditary, amyloidosis. This is a rare form passed down through families. It often affects the liver, nerves, heart, and kidneys. Many genetic defects are linked to a higher chance of amyloid disease. For example, an abnormal protein like transthyretin (TTR) is usually the cause. Age-related (senile) systemic amyloidosis. This is caused by deposits of normal TTR in the heart and other tissues. It happens most commonly in older men. Organ-specific amyloidosis. This causes deposits of amyloid protein in single organs, including the skin (cutaneous amyloidosis). Though some types of amyloid deposits have been linked to Alzheimer's disease, the brain is rarely affected by amyloidosis that happens throughout your body."", 'Risk Factors for Amyloidosis Men get amyloidosis more often than women. Your risk for amyloidosis goes up as you grow older. Amyloidosis affects 15% of patients with a form of cancer called multiple myeloma. Amyloidosis may also happen in people with end-stage kidney disease who are on dialysis for a long time (see ""Dialysis-related amyloidosis"" above).', 'Symptoms of Amyloidosis Symptoms of amyloidosis are often subtle. They can also vary greatly depending on where the amyloid protein is collecting in the body. It is important to note that the symptoms described below may be due to a variety of health problems. Only your doctor can make a diagnosis of amyloidosis. General symptoms of amyloidosis may include: Changes in skin color Severe fatigue Feeling of fullness Joint pain Low red blood cell count (anemia) Shortness of breath Swelling of the tongue Tingling and numbness in legs and feet Weak hand grip Severe weakness Sudden weight loss', 'Cardiac Amyloidosis (Stiff Heart Syndrome) This condition can cause less blood to flow to your heart muscle. Eventually, your heart will no longer be able to pump normally.', ""Some doctors also call cardiac amyloidosis “stiff heart syndrome.” Others say a stiff heart is actually a symptom of cardiac amyloidosis. Either way, amyloid deposits in your heart can make the muscular walls of your heart stiff. They can also make your heart muscle weaker and affect the electrical rhythm of the heart. Stiff heart syndrome can be serious. It may lead to congestive heart failure if it's not successfully treated. Who’s at risk? Cardiac amyloidosis is more common in men than in women. It’s also more likely to affect older people. People under 40 rarely get the condition. You can inherit stiff heart syndrome. Other things that raise your chances of getting it are: Having untreated high blood pressure Being obese Being over 60 Having gone through menopause What are the symptoms? If amyloidosis affects your heart, some symptoms you might notice are: Shortness of breath when you're doing light activity or lying down An irregular heartbeat Signs of heart failure, including swelling of the feet and ankles, weakness, fatigue, and nausea, among others"", ""These can be signs of other health conditions, too. So see your doctor to figure out what’s going on. How is it diagnosed? Your doctor will ask you about your symptoms and whether anyone in your family has cardiac amyloidosis or other heart conditions. They’ll give you a physical exam, too. The doctor may do several tests to diagnose or rule out cardiac amyloidosis, like: Blood and urine tests Imaging tests to see inside your body, like ultrasound, echocardiogram, electrocardiogram, MRI, or CT scan Biopsy Genetic testing, if cardiac amyloidosis runs in your family What are the treatments? There’s more than one type of cardiac amyloidosis. Your treatment will depend on the type you have. Among the options your doctor might recommend are: Medications, including chemotherapy and immunotherapy A pacemaker A stem cell transplant While some of these treatments, like chemo and immunotherapy, are also used to treat cancer, cardiac amyloidosis isn't cancer. It's a disease that affects the heart muscle. There's no cure, but there are treatments for most types of cardiac amyloidosis. Getting an early diagnosis is important since treatment can prevent permanent damage."", 'Renal (Kidney) Amyloidosis Your kidneys filter waste and toxins from your blood. Amyloid deposits in the kidneys make it hard for them to do this job. When your kidneys do not work properly, water and dangerous toxins build up in your body. If amyloidosis affects the kidneys, you may have: Signs of kidney failure, including swelling of the feet and ankles and puffiness around the eyes High levels of protein in your urine', 'Gastrointestinal Amyloidosis Amyloid deposits along your gastrointestinal (GI) tract slow down the movement of food through your intestines. This interferes with digestion. If amyloidosis affects your GI tract, you may have: Less appetite Diarrhea Nausea Stomach pain Weight loss If your liver is affected, that can cause liver enlargement and fluid buildup in the body.', ""Amyloid Neuropathy Amyloid deposits can damage the nerves outside your brain and spinal cord, called the peripheral nerves. The peripheral nerves carry information between your brain and spinal cord and the rest of your body. For example, they make your brain perceive pain if you burn your hand or stub your toes. If amyloidosis affects your nerves, you may have: Balance problems Problems controlling your bladder and bowel Sweating problems Tingling and weakness Lightheadedness when standing due to a problem with your body's ability to control blood pressure"", ""Diagnosing Amyloidosis A thorough physical exam and a detailed and accurate account of your medical history are crucial in helping your doctor diagnose amyloidosis. Blood and urine tests can spot abnormal proteins. Depending on your symptoms, your doctor may also check your thyroid and liver. Your doctor will do a biopsy to confirm a diagnosis of amyloidosis and know the specific type of protein you have. The tissue sample for the biopsy may be taken from your belly fat (the abdominal fat pad), bone marrow, or sometimes your mouth, rectum, or other organs. It's not always necessary to biopsy the part of the body damaged by the amyloid deposits. Imaging tests can also help. They show the amount of damage to organs like your heart, liver, or spleen. Your doctor will do a genetic test if they think you have a type that is passed down through families. Treatment for hereditary amyloidosis is different from treatment for other types of the disease. Once you’re diagnosed, your doctor might check your heart with an echocardiogram or your liver and spleen with imaging tests."", 'Amyloidosis Treatment There is no cure for amyloidosis. Your doctor will prescribe treatments to slow the development of the amyloid protein and manage your symptoms. If amyloidosis is related to another condition, then treatment will include targeting that underlying condition. Specific treatment depends on what type of amyloidosis you have and how many organs are affected. High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant can help remove the substance that leads to amyloid formation in some people with primary AL amyloidosis. Chemotherapy medicines alone may be used to treat other patients with primary AL amyloidosis. Secondary (AA) amyloidosis is treated by controlling the underlying disorder and with powerful anti-inflammatory medicines called steroids, which fight inflammation. A liver transplant may treat\xa0the disease if you have certain types of hereditary amyloidosis. New therapies can slow the production of the abnormal protein TTR. Your doctor might also recommend a kidney transplant. Other treatments to help with symptoms include: Diuretic medicine to remove extra water from your body Thickeners to add to fluids to prevent choking if you have trouble swallowing Compression stockings to relieve swelling in your legs or feet Changes to what you eat, especially if you have gastrointestinal amyloidosis', 'What to Expect Amyloidosis can be deadly, especially if it affects your heart or kidneys. Early diagnosis and treatment are important and can help improve survival. Researchers continue to question why some types of amyloid make people sick and how the formation of amyloid can be stopped. Studies to find new treatments are ongoing. If you have amyloidosis, consider asking your doctor if there are any clinical trials you can join, or search for one by visiting www.clinicaltrials.gov and typing in the search term ""amyloidosis.""']"
57,Precocious (Early) Puberty,"[""What Is Precocious Puberty? Precocious puberty , also known as early puberty, is when a child's body starts to go through the change into an adult body too soon. Puberty starts on average in girls between ages 8 and 13 and in boys between ages 9 and 14. Girls who show clear signs of puberty and its progression before age 8 and boys before age 9 are considered precocious. It affects about 1 out of 5,000 children. Many experts say that on average, puberty is starting earlier in the U.S. than it did in the past. The average age when girls get their first period has stayed roughly the same. But studies suggest that early signs—like breast development—are happening a year earlier than they did decades ago."", ""Precocious Puberty Types There are two types of precocious puberty: Central precocious puberty This type is more common. It's just like normal puberty, but it happens early. The pituitary gland starts making hormones called gonadotropins. These hormones cause the testicles or ovaries to make other hormones: testosterone or estrogen . These sex hormones cause the changes of puberty, like breast development in girls."", ""Peripheral precocious puberty This is also called precocious pseudopuberty and is less common. The hormones estrogen and testosterone trigger the symptoms. But the brain and pituitary gland aren't involved. It's usually a local problem with the ovaries, testicles, or adrenal glands."", ""Precocious Puberty Symptoms The signs of early puberty and puberty are usually the same. It's the timing that's different. Signs include: Girls: Breasts start to grow (often the first sign) Menstruation (typically not until 2-3 years after the earlier symptoms start) Boys: Facial hair begins to appear Testicles, penis, and scrotum start to grow Voice deepening (this is usually a late sign of puberty) May have spontaneous erections or ejaculation Girls and boys Rapid height growth Acne Adult body odor Underarm and pubic hair There are other conditions that might look like early puberty to parents—and sometimes even to pediatricians—but aren't: Premature thelarche is when a girl's breasts start to grow at a young age. It often affects girls who are just a few years old. While troubling for parents, it gets better on its own and isn't early puberty. It doesn't require treatment, but you should still take your child to a doctor to get their input. Premature pubarche is when pubic or underarm hair starts to grow at an early age. It can result from premature adrenarche, when the adrenal glands start releasing hormones early. Again, while it might seem alarming, it generally isn't a problem. It's also not an early sign of puberty. But because it may represent the first sign of an unusual and heavy release of adrenal hormones, your child should see a doctor."", ""Precocious Puberty Causes There are a number of reasons why kids may go through early puberty, which differ depending on the type. Central precocious puberty causes Most of the time, experts don't know what causes central precocious puberty, particularly in girls. Rarely, it can be triggered by another medical problem, such as: Tumors and other growths, which are often noncancerous (benign) Brain injury, either from surgery or a blow to the head, that affects hormonal balances Genetic conditions Seriously underactive thyroid Peripheral precocious puberty causes Usually, an underlying medical condition brings on puberty symptoms in these cases. Possibilities include: Tumors in the adrenal glands, ovaries, or testes Genetic conditions Exposure to products containing estrogen or testosterone"", ""Precocious Puberty Risk Factors While they aren't necessarily causes, a number of things are linked to early puberty. They include: Gender. Girls are 10 times as likely to have central precocious puberty as boys. Genetics. If precocious puberty is caused by a genetic problem, a child's parent or sibling may have it also. Race. Researchers don't know why, but on average, Black girls seem to start puberty about a year earlier than White girls. International adoption. One study showed that kids who are adopted outside the U.S. are 10-20 times more likely to develop precocious puberty. Experts aren't sure why, but the uncertainty of the exact ages of the adopted children might affect the study results. Obesity . A number of studies have shown a link between obesity in young girls and an increased risk of precocious puberty. But researchers don't know how direct the tie is. Obesity doesn't seem to be connected to early puberty in boys."", ""Precocious Puberty Diagnosis To figure out if your child has precocious puberty, your doctor may: Go over their medical history Do a physical exam Do a blood test to check their hormone levels X-ray their hands and wrists to look at bone age; this tells them if the bones are growing too quickly If the doctor sees signs of precocious puberty, they'll also run a test to see what kind it is. It's called a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) stimulation test. The doctor gives your child a shot of these hormones, then takes a series of blood samples over a period to check their hormone response. If other hormones rise, that's a sign of central precocious puberty. If levels of other hormones stay the same, that's a sign of peripheral precocious puberty."", ""Your kid may get more tests to see what may be causing their condition. That can include: An MRI to look for brain issues Blood tests for thyroid function An ultrasound to look for a tumor Questions for the doctor You'll need to work with your child's doctor to decide what to do next. These questions can help get the conversation started. Which tests will you use to determine if my child has precocious puberty? Do you see any signs to suggest this is caused by a tumor or some other medical condition? What options are available to treat this condition? What are the side effects of treatment? How long do you recommend my child stay on this treatment? How will I know if the treatment is working or not working? What local services are available to help me support my child's emotional well-being? What if we don't treat it?"", ""Precocious Puberty Treatment Your child may be referred to a specialist called a pediatric endocrinologist for treatment. The treatment approach will depend on what's causing your child's precocious puberty. Watchful waiting. In many cases, your doctor won't be able to find a cause. They may suggest watching your kid for a few months. GnRH analogue therapy. If your child has central precocious puberty and no other conditions, the doctor may suggest GnRH analogue therapy. This is a medication your child gets once a month in a shot, until they reach the normal age for puberty. It stops sexual development while they take it. Histrelin implant ( Vantas ). Your child would need a minor surgery to get this implant. The doctor puts it under the skin of the inside part of their upper arm. It also delays development but doesn't require monthly shots. The implant lasts a year. Treatment of another condition. If your kid has a condition that's causing precocious puberty, treating that will usually stop it."", ""Precocious Puberty Complications For kids, early puberty can cause physical and emotional problems. They include: Short stature. While kids with precocious puberty are often tall for their age, some wind up short as adults. Why? Once puberty is over, growth stops. Because precocious puberty ends earlier than normal puberty, these kids stop growing at an earlier age. The result may be a shorter height than they would have otherwise had. Behavior problems. Some studies show a link between early puberty and behavior problems, particularly in kids with developmental delays . But other experts say the proof is weak. Stress . Even when it's happening to average 12-year-olds, puberty can be a confusing time. It can be all the more stressful for younger kids with early puberty. Other risks. Some studies show a link between early puberty in girls and a slightly increased risk of breast cancer later in life. But the evidence isn't clear. Keep an eye out for signs your child is struggling emotionally. This can include things like: A drop in their grades Other problems at school Avoiding social situations Loss of interest in things they usually enjoy"", ""Tips for Parents As a parent, it's easy to worry about early puberty. While you should take any signs seriously, keep in mind: Symptoms that might seem like early puberty are often unrelated and clear up on their own. When treatment is necessary, it usually works well. Most kids with signs of early puberty do fine, medically, psychologically, and socially."", ""How to Support Your Child Most kids want to fit in. Developing early could make your child feel self-conscious. Other people may expect more maturity because they think your kid is older than they are. These challenges plus the emotional changes from extra hormones can be a lot for them to deal with. How can you help? Explain what's happening in their body in simple terms. Keep the lines of communication open. Encourage them to talk freely about their feelings. Treat them appropriately for their age. Watch out for teasing. Do what you can to boost their self-esteem. Focus your praise on grades or activities rather than appearance. Counseling or a support group may also help. Ask your child's doctor for a referral or other resources.""]"
58,Premature Ejaculation,"[""What Is Premature Ejaculation? Premature ejaculation (PE) is when you have an orgasm before intercourse or sooner than you'd like during sex. It can be frustrating and even embarrassing, but PE is a common issue for anyone with a penis. About 30%-40% of those assigned male at birth have it at some point in their life. So, keep in mind that it’s not something to worry about if it happens only occasionally. Premature ejaculation (PE) can happen from time to time. If it occurs regularly for you or your partner, there are ways to get help. (Photo Credit: Stone/Getty Images) Premature ejaculation time There is no set time when you should ejaculate during sex, but if you ejaculate and lose your erection early, you and your partner may feel there’s not enough time to enjoy it. If you ejaculate within 1-3 minutes of penetration on a regular basis, or are unable to delay ejaculation during sexual situations such as masturbation, you may want to talk to your doctor about treatment options."", ""Premature Ejaculation Causes The cause of PE isn't really known, but your brain chemistry could be at least partly the reason. People with low levels of the chemical serotonin in their brains tend to take a shorter time to ejaculate. Psychological causes that can play a role include: Stress Depression Anxiety Guilt Relationship problems Lack of confidence or poor body image Concern over your sexual performance Negative feelings about the idea of sex (sexual repression) Early sexual experiences Sexual abuse"", 'Premature Ejaculation Risk Factors Some physical conditions may also cause PE. You may be at risk for PE if you have any of the following conditions: Unusual hormone levels Irregular levels of neurotransmitters (an imbalance of the chemicals in your brain that pass messages or impulses to the rest of your body) Inflammation or an infection in your prostate or urethra (the tube that runs from your bladder and sends pee out of your body) Genetic traits you inherit from your parents Sometimes, PE can be a problem for people with erectile dysfunction (ED). That’s when the penis doesn’t remain firm enough for sex. Those who are worried they could lose their erection may develop a pattern of rushing to ejaculate. It can be a hard habit to break. Treating the erectile dysfunction may make the premature ejaculation go away. There are many medication options, so discuss any concerns with your doctor.', 'Premature Ejaculation Diagnosis To diagnose PE, your doctor may start by asking if you’ve always had the problem or if it’s a new thing. They may ask about your sex life or your relationships . You’ll probably get a physical exam, too. If your doctor thinks emotional issues are causing your PE, they may refer you to a mental health professional who works with people who have trouble with sex. If a physical problem is causing it, they might recommend that you see a doctor called a urologist, who specializes in conditions that affect your urinary system.', 'Premature Ejaculation Treatment Treatment could start with you seeking counseling. A psychologist or psychiatrist can help you work through problems such as depression, anxiety , or stress that may be contributing to your PE. Other ways to treat PE include: Premature ejaculation pills Your doctor may also talk with you about medication. While there aren’t any drugs specifically approved to treat PE, medicines used to treat other things may help in some cases. This is called an off-label use, and not approved by the FDA, so be sure to discuss it with your doctor. These include: Antidepressants. A side effect of some selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) is delayed orgasm. But these medications also have side effects that include nausea and drowsiness. They also can throw a wet blanket on your desire to have sex. So, you may be trading one problem for another. You and your doctor will decide what’s right for you. Tramadol . This is a pain reliever that can delay ejaculation. It may be prescribed if antidepressants don’t help. This medicine is addictive, so it may not be an option for you. Medications for erectile dysfunction. These drugs may also help\xa0you maintain an erection. They include sildenafil citrate ( Viagra ), tadalafil ( Cialis ), or vardenafil HCI ( Levitra ).', 'Anesthetic creams or sprays Instead of pills, you can put an anesthetic cream or spray on the head of your penis to make it less sensitive. Leave it on for about 30 minutes. It must be washed off before sex so you don’t lose your erection or cause loss of sensation for your partner.', 'Premature Ejaculation Home Remedies About 95% of people are estimated to recover from PE with the help of psychological, medical, and behavioral therapies that help control ejaculation. You can try the following behavioral techniques at home: Start-stop. You or your partner can stimulate your penis until you feel like you’re going to have an orgasm. Stop the arousal for about 30 seconds or until the feeling passes. Start the stimulation again and repeat three or four more times before you ejaculate. The squeeze. It works the same way as the start and stop method. But, when you feel like you’re reaching orgasm, you or your partner squeezes the head of your penis until you lose the erection. Repeat this a few times before ejaculating.', 'Some people find that if they think of something else during sex they can last longer. If those don’t work for you, you can try a few other things: Strengthen your muscles. Weak pelvic floor muscles sometimes contribute to PE. Kegel exercises may help strengthen them. Find the right muscles to tighten by stopping your urine in midstream. Hold them tight for 3 seconds and then release them for 3 seconds. Do this 10 times, at least three times a day. Wear a condom. It may desensitize you enough so you can last longer. Get busy before you “get busy.” Some people find that masturbating a few hours before sex helps them stay in control during intercourse. Ayurvedic medicine for premature ejaculation There is limited research on whether Ayurveda , a traditional form of medicine from India, can help treat PE. Ayurvedic treatments can include practicing yoga, taking herbal supplements, and changing your diet.', 'Premature Ejaculation Complications If your relationship is affected by PE, talking about the problem is an important first step. A relationship counselor or sex therapist may be able to help. PE may also make it hard to start a family because the sperm may not reach an egg to fertilize it, or depression related to PE might affect your sex drive or performance. A fertility specialist can talk with you and your partner about some other options.', ""Takeaways Premature ejaculation can happen to anyone with a penis, but if you feel it's happening regularly, there are ways to address it. Talk to your doctor to see if counseling, medication, or behavioral techniques can help you last longer. Whether you have goals to start a family or just want to have more satisfying sex, you can get support from a variety of health care professionals."", ""Premature Ejaculation FAQs What is the main cause of premature ejaculation? There isn't one main cause of PE.

59,What Is Premature Ovarian Failure?,"['Primary ovarian insufficiency used to be called premature ovarian failure. It’s a condition that affects women well before they should reach menopause . A healthy woman ’s ovaries produce estrogen . This hormone controls menstrual periods and makes you fertile (able to get pregnant ). With age, your ovaries eventually stop making estrogen . Sometimes, the ovaries stop working long before menopause is expected. (The average age for menopause is 51.) If you’re younger than 40 and your ovaries no longer make eggs and your periods have stopped, it may be primary ovarian insufficiency.', 'Causes Inside the ovaries are small sacs, called follicles. They hold eggs as they grow and mature. Girls are usually born with about 2 million “seeds” that turn into these follicles, which last through menopause. If you have primary ovarian insufficiency, your follicles either run out (your doctor may call this depletion) or don’t work properly (also called dysfunction). Doctors aren’t sure why this happens. This condition may be more likely if your mother or sister had it. Other things that may make it more likely include: Autoimmune disorders Chemotherapy and radiation therapy Genetic and chromosomal disorders, including Fragile X syndrome and Turner syndrome Viral infections', 'Symptoms You may not know your ovaries aren’t working normally. Some women with premature ovarian failure still have periods and may even get pregnant . But many who have this condition have trouble getting pregnant . That’s usually what prompts a visit to the doctor. The most common symptoms of premature ovarian failure are missed or infrequent periods. Periods may start and stop again for many years. Other symptoms can seem like those of menopause and may include: Hot flashes Night sweats Anxiety , depression , or mood swings Concentration or memory problems Your sex drive isn’t what it used to be Trouble sleeping Vaginal dryness , which can make sex uncomfortable', 'Diagnosis If your periods have stopped or are infrequent, your doctor will do blood tests to check your hormone levels and rule out pregnancy , thyroid disease, and other health conditions. The first blood tests you’ll likely take will measure your blood levels of: FSH (follicle stimulating hormone). Your pituitary gland makes this hormone, which tells the ovaries to release an egg each month. Estradiol . This is a type of estrogen made by your ovaries.', 'Results from these tests help your doctor understand what may be going on with your ovaries. Your doctor may diagnose you with primary ovarian insufficiency if you’re under age 40 and have any of the following: High FSH levels (in the menopause range) on two different tests done at least 1month apart Low estradiol level, which means your ovaries aren’t making enough estrogen No periods or irregular periods (less often than every 35 days) for 3 months in a row Your doctor might also recommend that you get a transvaginal ultrasound . This imaging test shows your ovaries. Women with primary ovarian insufficiency usually have smaller ovaries with few follicles. If you do have this condition, you may get more tests to check on the cause.', 'Health Effects Low levels of estrogen can affect more than just your ability to get pregnant. Estrogen is necessary for a healthy heart and bones, among other things. If your ovaries don’t make enough of this hormone, you may be more likely to have other health conditions, such as: Anxiety and depression Eye disease, including dry eye High cholesterol and heart disease Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid ) Osteoporosis Talk to your doctor about ways to lower your risks. A healthy lifestyle and medication may help prevent some of these conditions.', 'Treatment Although there’s no cure, there are treatments that can ease symptoms and potential complications related to low estrogen levels. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is the most common. This treatment usually combines estrogen and progestin , although your doctor may prescribe other forms. You may take it by mouth, put it on your skin, or place it in your vagina. Make sure that you and your doctor talk about the possible side effects and risks if you’re considering this type of treatment. Doctors usually prescribe calcium and vitamin D supplements to prevent bone loss , which can happen when estrogen levels drop. If you don’t work out, you’ll need to make fitness a habit, since weight-bearing exercises can help keep your bones strong and your heart healthy. If you were hoping to get pregnant but find that you have primary ovarian insufficiency, you may want to talk with a counselor and also work with your doctor to understand what your options may be to start or expand your family.']"
60,Progeria,"[""What Is Progeria? Progeria is also known as Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) or the “Benjamin Button” disease (named after the short story and movie ‘The Curious Case of Benjamin Button’). It’s\xa0 a rare genetic condition that results in\xa0 a child's body aging rapidly. A mutation in the LMNA gene causes progeria. Most kids with progeria don’t live past age 13. The disease affects people of all sexes and races equally. About 1 in every 4 million babies are born with it worldwide. A single mistake in a certain gene causes it to make an abnormal protein. When cells use this protein, called progerin, they break down more easily. This leads kids with progeria to age quickly."", 'Progeria Symptoms There are\xa0usually no symptoms when a baby is born, but they start to show signs of the disease during their first year. They develop physical traits including: Slow height and weight growth A bigger head Large eyes , which they can’t close all the way A small lower jaw A thin nose with a ""beaked"" tip Ears that stick out Veins you can see Slow and abnormal tooth growth A high-pitched voice Loss of body fat and muscle Hair loss , including eyelashes and eyebrows Thin, wrinkled skin that shows spots', ""As children with progeria get older, they get diseases you'd expect to see in people age 50 and older, including bone loss , hardening of the arteries , and heart disease . Children with progeria usually die of heart attacks or strokes. Progeria doesn't affect a child's intelligence or brain development. A child with the condition isn't any more likely to get infections than other kids, either."", 'Progeria Causes and Risk Factors A mutation in the lamin A (LMNA) gene causes progeria. The gene makes a protein that holds together the center of a cell. With progeria, the body makes an abnormal form of lamin A called progerin, which leads to rapid aging. Researchers haven’t found any risk factors for progeria. It isn’t inherited\xa0or passed down in families.', ""Progeria Diagnosis The symptoms are\xa0 noticeable. It's likely that a pediatrician will spot them during a routine checkup."", ""If you see changes in your child that seem like symptoms of progeria, make an appointment with your pediatrician or family doctor. Your doctor will do a physical exam , test hearing and vision , measure pulse and blood pressure , and compare your child's height and weight to other kids the same age. If your pediatrician is concerned, you may need to see a specialist in medical genetics\xa0who can confirm the diagnosis with a blood test. Before the genetic blood tests were availables, doctors could only diagnose progeria with X-rays and observation."", ""Progeria Treatments There's no cure for progeria, but researchers are working on finding one. One clinical trial is looking at a kind of cancer drug, FTIs (farnesyltransferase inhibitors), to see if it can help slow the disease. Treatments can help ease or delay some of the disease's symptoms. Medication and diet changes. Your child's doctor may suggest drugs and changes to your child’s diet to lower cholesterol or prevent blood clots . A low dose of aspirin every day can help prevent heart attacks and stroke . Growth hormone can help build height and weight. The FDA has approved lonafarnib ( Zokinvy )\xa0to prevent the buildup of defective progerin, which can affect the heart. Physical and occupational therapy can help your child keep moving if they have stiff joints or hip problems. Surgery. Some children may have coronary bypass surgery or angioplasty to slow the progression of heart disease . At home. Kids with progeria are more likely to get dehydrated, so they need to drink plenty of water, especially when they're sick or it's hot. Small meals more often can help them eat enough, too. Cushioned shoes or inserts can ease discomfort and encourage your child to play and stay active. Sunscreen. Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 15. Reapply it every 2 hours, or more if your child is sweating or swimming."", 'Progeria Complications Children with progeria usually develop a condition called atherosclerosis, which hardens and slows blood flow from blood vessels that carry nutrients and oxygen to your body. Most children with progeria die of heart attacks and strokes related to atherosclerosis.', 'Similar Conditions Wiedemann-Rautenstrauch syndrome and Werner syndrome , which are similar to progeria, tend to be inherited. Both of these rare syndromes also cause rapid aging and a shortened life span.']"
61,"Caring for Parents, Keeping Them Healthy","[""Sound Body, Sound Mind When caring for an older adult, it's important not to overlook routine care -- stuff that seems obvious but that may not be on your radar. Here is a rundown of what to keep in mind. Everyone needs regular checkups. But some older adults (and young ones, too) reason that since they just saw the doctor last month about that sinus problem, they don't need to go again. A visit to the doctor for a specific problem, however, doesn't take the place of a complete checkup. Make sure your parent is eating a balanced diet. Accompany them to the market to guide shopping choices, teach how to read labels, and discuss the importance of all the food groups, vitamins, fiber, and calcium . ID jewelry with pertinent medical alert and contact information should be worn by all older adults. There is a huge variety of bracelets, pendants, and even watchbands available. One company that sells them is American Medical Identifications ."", 'Know your mother\'s baseline -- what\'s ""normal"" for them. Some older adults have a lower normal body temperature than 98.6 degrees Farenheit, and others have had chronic problems throughout their lives. Be familiar with Mom\'s ""default setting,"" and be aware of changes. Know that baselines change as a person ages. If, for instance, they go\xa0through surgery, chances are they will come out of it with a new baseline. Know your loved one\'s complete medical history and keep a record of it to be taken to doctor\'s appointments and checked often. Just as important is to know your own medical history, in case genetic issues arise or transplants or transfusions become necessary. Unless told otherwise by your doctor, you should each be drinking eight glasses of water a day. Did you know that dehydration is a common cause of many disorders in older adults, including circulation problems? Make sure liquids are available all day long. How about an attractive thermos for the bedside or a water cooler in the living room and on the patio? Get one on casters so it can be moved from room to room.', ""Blood pressure is an issue among most older adults. Get a reliable sphygmomanometer (a blood pressure monitor) and teach your loved one -- and yourself -- to take blood pressure readings . Some pharmacies take blood pressure readings and teach you to do it yourself for free. Local community service organizations such as the Kiwanis or Lions Club often offer free eye exams and eyeglasses to older adults who can't easily afford them. Your Area Agency on Aging will tell you what's available in your area. Free dental care is available from local dental schools, and often, a low income is not even a requirement. Contact the dental college in your area. Keep a diary of your parent's health progress. If your loved one is running a temperature or experiencing any other condition that may require a doctor's care, keep hourly notes and temperature readings for later reference. Wash your hands often when caring for your parents. Remind them to wash theirs, too. Keep plenty of moisturizer around. Dry, chapped hands are especially common in winter. When you visit department stores, ask the people at the cosmetics counters for free samples, and keep these around the house to be used often."", ""Even natural supplements can sometimes be a bad mix with certain medications or cause side effects on their own. Ask your mom if they are taking anything like herbs or other supplements . Check them out with their doctor, no matter how harmless you believe they are. Foot massagers are great for promoting blood circulation and avoiding cracked heals, which can sometimes split. This is especially important in people with diabetes. A digital thermometer is easier to use than a mercury thermometer. Take temperatures using the armpit if your parent has breathing problems or is easily confused. If Mom has breathing problems and uses an inhaler, keep several around your house and hers, in the car, and so forth. Many trips to the bathroom may indicate a urinary tract infection , common among older people who don't always get the fluids they need. Consult a doctor immediately."", ""Consult a podiatrist immediately for corns, calluses , bunions , blisters , sores, and infections, or ingrown, hard, brittle, split, or discolored toenails. If your senior has problem feet, a weekly trip to a salon for a pedicure makes a great outing. Most salons have special discount days for older adults. Don't forget to ask about these."", 'Keep a checklist -- a ""report card"" -- and update it periodically to keep track of how your parent is doing with meal preparation, housework, mobility (in and out of the house), laundry, shopping, money issues, medications, bathing, dressing, and eating. These are key activities of daily living (ADLs), and difficulty with them indicates there may be trouble. If your parent or parents live in a multilevel home but has problems with stairs, consider a chair lift. They are not inexpensive, but they can be cheaper than moving and will help keep your parent independent for a longer time. For someone who sits a lot, an ergonomic chair that offers greater lumbar support and adjustable features (chair height, armrest height, seat depth) can make a huge difference in overall health. Ergonomic chairs come in all kinds of models and varying prices. If an ergonomic chair is not an option, make sure your father\'s chair has an adjustable height feature, the seat depth is approximately two-thirds the length of their thighs and buttocks, the back is at least fourteen inches high, and the armrests are no more than nine inches high.', 'Bad posture can complicate back problems and limit mobility. Is Mom walking as upright as they used to? Is Dad favoring one leg over the other for some reason? Sometimes the answer can be as simple as a new pair of shoes. Osteoporosis is a serious problem for older women, leading to height changes and serious (sometimes deadly) fractures . Schedule your parent for a bone density test , and encourage weight-bearing exercise (walking, light weights, gardening). Make sure Mom gets plenty of calcium (the new "" chocolate chew"" supplements are delicious), and ask their doctor about hormone replacement therapy or other treatments.', ""Make sure Mom has a mammogram annually. If there are precautionary measures that must be remembered, make a checklist and post it in a place where it can't possibly be missed. But change the list and its location from time to time so that it doesn't get taken for granted after a while. If you use a dry erase board or a chalkboard, ask your parent to check off the points as they are followed."", 'The older you get, the more you are affected by alcohol. On the other hand, a glass of wine now and then has been known to be beneficial for the heart . Check with your loved one\'s doctor for a good rule of thumb. In the meantime, locate some ""zero-proof"" recipes and dress them up -- tiny umbrellas and all -- for a special or even not-so-special occasion. Don\'t minimize changes in your parents\' health, even if they seem minor. These changes may be accompanied by fear, which can exacerbate even a minor problem. Address your parents\' fears; be positive about your ability to find a solution. Anemia is very common among older adults, usually resulting from either a loss of blood or a poor diet. Check with the doctor as to whether iron supplements (taken with orange juice or with vitamin C for better absorption) might be in order. Help prevent infections by keeping antibacterial wet wipes handy at all times. Keep boxes of them around the house; individually wrapped ones can go in your purse or wallet and in the car.', 'Avoid foot fungus by keeping feet clean and dry. That means changing socks daily and shoes often. It\'s also a good idea to let feet ""air out"" once a day. Nylon or synthetic socks are more likely to make feet sweat. Cotton is better. If socks are too tight at the tops, they can interfere with circulation. Cut notches into them to make sure they don\'t bind. Teach your loved one to respect pain. If something hurts, there\'s a reason for it. Bedsores -- or pressure sores -- result when there is constant pressure on an area where bones are close to the skin \'s surface. Be on the lookout for problems in these most vulnerable areas: the back of the head, the shoulder blades, the elbows, the base of the spine, the hips, the heels, and the ankles . Consult a doctor if you see red, cracking, or dried skin. In the meantime, encourage Dad to move about when they can, and don\'t leave them sitting or lying on a damp surface. Make sure linens are not irritating, and wash them often. Always wear (disposable) rubber gloves when you suspect you might have any kind of skin disorder, such as a rash , an infection, or a lesion of any type.', 'Eating and the Older Adult It\'s a good idea to accompany your mother to the supermarket occasionally to point out new products and to make sure they are shopping wisely. Encourage them to read labels for salt content, sugar, and other health considerations. If they resist, urge them to at least heed fat content. Generally, none of us should be taking in more than 30% of our daily calorie intake in the form of fat, and of that, no more than 10% should come from saturated fats. Olive oil is a good source of unsaturated fat. Frozen foods, which are processed right after they are harvested, often retain more vitamins than ""fresh"" vegetables, which may sit on shelves for days before getting to the supermarket. When ordering packaged meals from local agencies, ask for extra vegetables. Also, consider supplementing the meal with a homemade side dish. Would a small refrigerator or a mini microwave in the bedroom or family room make it easier for Dad to have nutritious snacks all day long?', ""If shopping is a problem, maybe you can fit an extra freezer in Mom's home somewhere that will allow them to stock up. Does your grandfather need help with cooking? Contact Meals on Wheels of America to find a local program that will deliver free meals to their home. All adults older than sixty are eligible. Note that Meals on Wheels doesn't deliver on weekends, so you'll have to make other arrangements. Can a neighbor help? How about a local church or other religious organization? Or ask a local favorite restaurant to deliver a couple of meals. If your father has vision problems, put liquid in a see-through cup or glass so they can see the liquid. If your mother's on a special diet, write the day's menu on a blackboard and ask them to check each item off as it's consumed. Fax a weekly shopping list to your parent's local market and ask for it to be delivered. You can even pay for it over the phone with your credit card. Find easy recipes that allow your parent to cook with canned and packaged foods -- they combine quickly and are quite tasty. There are a variety of cookbooks in this category. Mom might enjoy Desperation Dinners , by Beverly Mills and Alicia Ross; for Dad, how about A Man, a Can, a Plan , by David Joachim."", 'There are cookbooks available with easy recipes suitable for special diets (diabetes, heart disease), cooking for one, or microwave cooking. Browse the bookstore or search Amazon.com for the one that will suit your parents\' tastes. When you call, casually ask your parent to tell you what they have been eating. ""What did you have for dinner last night?"" is better than ""How\'s your appetite?"" If Mom is passing up making the meals they once loved because ""it\'s just one person,"" get them a small wok and a cooking-for-one cook-book. Schedule visits at mealtimes so they\'ll have an excuse to cook. If asked, the grocer might break up packages to sell smaller quantities to your parent, like a half-dozen eggs, two potatoes, or just a few slices of bread (the grocer can use the rest of the loaf to make sandwiches). Ultra-pasteurized milk that comes in cardboard cartons has a very long shelf life. Just make sure your parent chills it before drinking and refrigerates it after it\'s opened.', 'If your loved one takes a long time to eat, arrange for them to start their meal before everyone else. Be especially patient at mealtimes; older adults often eat much more slowly than what you may be used to. Try to minimize distractions at mealtimes, and don\'t bring up stressful subjects. ""We usually have dinner with my grandmother on Sunday nights. It\'s nice, but sometimes she can go on autopilot, where instead of having a conversation, she just has a long monologue, a riff on everything. You can\'t get a word in edgewise. That can be frustrating, but as my father pointed out, she spends a lot of her week alone, bottling up thoughts and ideas, and so when she gets a chance to unload, she needs to let it all out."" -Ilene Klausner A person who is easily confused might have an easier mealtime if you serve one course at a time and clear each one away before serving the next. A solid-color tablecloth, as opposed to a patterned one, will minimize mealtime distractions.', 'Maybe your parent or grandparent just hates eating in the kitchen. Try moving to the dining room or even a space outdoors. Don\'t ever wrap dentures in napkins, assuming you will retrieve them after the meal. Chances are they\'ll be thrown out. Freeze small containers of your leftovers from home to share with your parent. Label them with the date and contents. Freeze sauces, soups, and bouillon in ice cube trays so that individual servings can be popped out and heated. Make sure that your parent or grandparent has access to lots of healthy, easy-to-eat snacks, such as berries, bagels, pitas, cheese, raisins, crackers, energy bars, or apple, melon, or orange slices. If Mom\'s appetite is lagging, find out if they have a taste or yen for something special. Experiment with old recipes to make them more palatable and ""legal"" (use lactose-free milk, salt and sugar substitutes, ground meat instead of cubed, or yogurt instead of cream, but first consult a doctor about the interaction of these substitutes with any medications). There are tons of books on the subject and most have recipes. Consult them.', 'If your loved one is having trouble gaining or maintaining weight, pack their diet with liquid calories. Fruit juices, milk, and milk alternatives such as soy, rice, and nut milks are high in nutrients and calories and are much less filling than solid foods. Smoothies, yogurt shakes, and protein drinks are a little more filling, but may still make a good meal alternative. Respect your father\'s tastes. If they have\xa0hated yogurt all their life, don\'t start feeding it to them now just because they are less able to resist. A water filter makes a great gift for an older parent or grandparent. Four or five smaller meals during the day can be more manageable than three large ones. This approach has the added benefit of keeping blood sugar levels more even throughout the day. If your parent has vision problems, use the ""clock"" method of serving food: the main dish is right in front of them at ""six o\'clock,"" the starch dish is farthest and directly opposite at ""twelve o\'clock,"" and so on.', 'When family and friends call and ask what gift they can bring, suggest prepared foods. (If your parent gets Meals on Wheels deliveries, save the goodies for the weekend.) Use plastic bibs at mealtime. ""Dad flipped when he saw Mom come at him with a bib! He was furious and refused to wear it. \'I\'m not a baby,\' he screamed. So the next night when we sat down to eat, all of us -- the kids, me, my husband, and his parents -- wore bibs. We all wound up laughing about it, and Dad admitted that it wasn\'t such a big deal after all. We promised never to make him wear it in restaurants, unless, of course, he ordered the lobster."" -Vonda Giraldo It\'s OK to bring a special meal to a restaurant for your parent and ask to have it microwaved for you, just as long as everyone else is ordering off the menu. Waiters and waitresses want to help you; tell them what you need privately, to avoid embarrassment. And a good chef, if they are not too busy, can accommodate anyone. Show your appreciation, and tip accordingly.', ""Dry food can be difficult to swallow. Use sauces generously, but learn to make healthy versions. Use flexible straws. For those who refuse regular meals, keep healthy snacks (fruits, nutritious cookies, cut-up vegetables) available around the house. Finger foods are best. Be creative -- but not overbearing -- in your coaxing efforts. Try using children's non-spill cups with covers or sports drink containers with a straw. Make mealtime more special by using fancy plates and napkins. For some, it's easier to cut food with scissors than a knife and fork. If Mom can't cut their meat any longer, avoid embarrassment by cutting it for them in the kitchen before you serve. Soft and pureed foods don't have to be bland and tasteless. Find out which herbs and spices make an otherwise bland dish interesting. You might also serve the following in colorful combinations: cereal puddings and gelatin cooked and creamed vegetables cheese soups and stews egg salad and tuna and other fish salads tabouli, baba ganoush, and hummus cooked fish sushi pasta stewed fruit egg rolls, cut up chicken nuggets scrambled eggs and omelettes pancakes and French toast rice and risotto yogurt meat loaf"", 'Baby food is great if you need to get a meal together in a hurry. The fruit selections are delicious! Get a copy of The Non-Chew Cookbook , by Randy J. Wilson. No one likes to eat alone. If Mom insists that you partake of their bland, pureed diet, consider bringing along your own snacks at mealtime. Too many items on the table can be confusing. Keep condiments to a minimum. ""My mother hated dinnertime and often refused to settle down for it. So we started a routine of getting a little dressed up for dinner each night -- she wears a nice brooch and one of her many scarves, and she likes to carry a purse -- and now she looks forward to what\'s become her favorite part of our day."" -Michaela Kevis Freely make use of microwaveable prepackaged foods. You can stock up on them and put them in the freezer after marking each with the day of the week when it should be eaten.', 'If your loved one can\'t swallow thin liquids, someone has probably recommended Thick-It, a tasteless powder that thickens hot and cold liquids. The canister is bulky, so keep small supplies of Thick-It in your bag to use on outings. If Dad\'s not supposed to drink unthickened liquid, don\'t cheat, not even ""just this once."" Older adults should always eat sitting up. Take your parent to lunch, even if you\'re at work. Call at lunchtime, and you can eat together -- you at the desk, they at home in the kitchen. But remember that it\'s dangerous for an older person (or anyone else) to talk while chewing. Your parent\'s peak period of digestion (when it\'s easiest to digest food) is midday. Plan the large meal for that time of day, and keep supper light. When feeding your father, only put one teaspoon of food in their mouth at once. Alternate spoonfuls of solids and liquids. Plan your mother\'s weekly menu ahead of time so shopping for all meals can be done at once. Copy their recipes onto cards and write the shopping list for each dish on the backs. Take the cards with you when you go shopping.', ""Older adults who seem to have endless appetites often forget they have just eaten. Put stickers on the clock for mealtimes so they can see how long it is until the next meal. Making small nutritious snacks available throughout the day is also helpful. Your parent should never lie down right after a meal -- that is the most common cause of indigestion. (Eating too fast is the second most common cause.) Make sure Mom sits or stands for at least an hour after they eat. Many medications leave an awful taste in the mouth that is far worse than anything you can imagine. They can make sugar taste like salt, and some favorite foods become completely inedible. Be especially patient during this time as you try new things to see what works. In the meantime, a lollipop may help your loved one after they have\xa0eaten something distasteful. (Don't give sucking candies to anyone who might easily swallow them whole.) You can get someone to come to the house just to feed meals to your parent. Contact your Area Agency on Aging."", 'Even if Mom isn\'t making use of the local senior center, they can attend every day just for meals. If salt is an issue, there are a bunch of flavorful seasoning substitutes on the market. ""I bribed Mom to eat toward the end -- it was the only way I could get her to take anything. I actually gave her a quarter for every meal. The funny thing is, I forgot all about this. Then, after she passed away and we were going through her bedroom, I found jars of quarters under her bed! It all added up to over $150, which we donated to the local food bank, which is exactly where I knew she\'d want it to go. It helped give us closure to know that the money that helped feed our mother would now feed others."" -Brenda Bienvenuti There are tons of special utensils that can make eating a lot easier; a combination fork and knife for one-handed eating, a tilted spoon for someone with hand problems, or a two-handled mug for easier drinking are available from the many suppliers of special-needs items. You can also buy plate guards that keep food from sliding off. B Independent offers a wide range of such products.', ""Jews, Christians, Sikhs, Muslims, and Hindus all incorporate fasting into various rituals and celebrations. If your parent is observant, but you suspect they may not be physically up to the fast, speak to their doctor or spiritual counselor, who can talk to them about reasonable exemptions from fasting. Diet supplements like Ensure are widely used in hospitals and nursing homes. Keep them cooled. Put a few cans on ice in the morning, and make them available all day long. A glass of wine, if it's allowed by your Mom's doctor, can stimulate the appetite."", 'Sleep and Older Adults If Grandma has trouble sleeping (and is not bedridden), encourage them to spend as little ""awake time"" as possible in bed. Reading, watching TV, and so forth, should be done in a favorite chair, while bed is for sleep only. Going to sleep and waking up at about the same time each day will also help train their body for better sleep overall.', ""Older adults should avoid oversleeping in the morning. It leads to having trouble falling asleep later, and the cycle of insomnia begins. If Dad can't fall asleep within fifteen minutes of getting into bed, suggest them to get up for a while and do something calming, and then try again later. Don't take sleep disruption lightly. It can be caused by an improper dose of medication, an illness, or a psychological problem. Talk about it with your loved one's doctor. Many drugs, including Halcion and even the antidepressants that are supposed to make their life better, can cause terrifying nightmares. If your father wakes with night terrors, be reassuring. Show them that there's no danger nearby, but avoid arguing. If they insist\xa0that something (or someone) woke them, let them know that whatever the trouble was, it's gone now. People of any age who have difficulty sleeping should avoid exercise in the late afternoon and evening. Try morning walks instead. Avoid caffeine, not just in the evening but at any time of day. Aside from coffee, tea, and cola, look out for caffeine in chocolate, non-cola soft drinks, and some pain relievers. And while decaffeinated coffee has less caffeine than regular, it's not caffeine-free."", 'Alcohol can make your senior drowsy at first, but it hurts healthy sleep in the long run by disturbing the sleep cycle, making sleep less restful, and making them more likely to wake up during the night. As with practically everything, ""A good laugh and a long sleep are the two best cures."" -Irish proverb Maintain a sleep diary to note sleep patterns. The doctor will find this information useful if you need to consult with her, and you might discover patterns you weren\'t aware of: Is sleeping a problem the night before the family comes to visit? Is this about anxiety or excitement? Visit the National Sleep Foundation for more information. If there are serious issues that require discussion, don\'t bring these up right before bedtime. Avoid arguments. Some people swear by a teaspoon of honey in a cup of hot water before bedtime. Others go for warm milk with a little cinnamon. But if liquids are a problem before bed, find a different solution. A foot bath or massage right before bed can help.', ""Get dark-lined (blackout) shades for people who don't sleep well, and block out disturbing noise with a fan or a white noise machine. Some models have a choice of sounds that mimic ocean waves, the patter of raindrops, and other soothing sounds. Aromatherapy using lavender candles and potpourri can be very relaxing. Try a couple drops of lavender oil in a bath or on the corner of your parent's pillow. You can even buy soft microwavable products that warm up potpourri inside. Change the linens often. Everyone enjoys fresh sheets. You can even buy lavender water to put in the wash. It's sold in a lot of home stores and catalogs these days. Unpleasant odors can interfere with sleep. Use potpourri and make sure the air in the room has a chance to circulate. When Mom's out of the room for a while, open the windows or light a scented candle. Create a sleep ritual before bedtime and follow this every evening. If you live far away, you can still call at bedtime to wish your parents sweet dreams."", ""Cotton pajamas and sheets are less irritating than synthetics.

Does Dad's snoring rock the house? Is Grandma really sleepy in the morning and drowsy during the day? They may have sleep apnea, a disorder in which the person stops breathing at points during sleep. Consistent loud snoring, observed episodes of not breathing, and morning and daytime sleepiness are some of the warning signs. Men, people who are over forty, and people who are overweight are all at higher risk, but anyone can have it, and it's more common than diabetes. Sleep apnea can lead to insomnia, high blood pressure, weight gain, headaches, memory problems, excessive drowsiness, depression, impotence -- the list goes on."", ""Make sure the mattress your father sleeps on is comfortable and right for them. Soft beds are nice, but maybe they need\xa0more support. It's easier to rise from a firm mattress. Some people are just not morning people. If getting your parent up every morning is a problem and you already have enough to do at that hour, let them stay in bed until midmorning, if they like, and get them up after the family has gone off to work and school. While it may be tempting to take naps, they should be avoided if they interfere with getting a good night's sleep. Arrange calming activities before bedtime; this is a time for reading, soft music, and soothing conversation. Have your loved one spend some time in pajamas before settling in to sleep. Saying prayers together before bedtime can be a wonderful ritual. Maybe Mom can't sleep because they have issues they can't talk about. Try to discuss this with them, or suggest they discuss the problem with another member of the family or a professional."", ""Remind your senior to go to the bathroom before going to sleep. If they get\xa0up often at night to go to the bathroom, suggest that they don't drink any liquids for three or four hours before bedtime. On the other hand, don't skimp too much on fluids during the day because you want to cut down on bathroom visits. Older adults often become dehydrated, which leads to painful (but common) urinary tract infections. Learn sleep techniques and teach them to your senior: Listen to your own breath and count breaths. Get comfortable, close your eyes, and begin breathing slowly but normally, then count each exhalation, either starting at one or counting back from one hundred. Practice progressive muscle relaxation by tensing and relaxing one limb at a time. Make a fist and clench your right arm, while keeping the left relaxed; then relax the right arm. Repeat with the left arm, then each leg. Use visualization techniques to picture yourself in a perfect, relaxing place, such as a quiet beach or lakeside. Try a tape or CD that will guide you through a relaxation exercise or visualization. There are many available. You can even make your own. Make up for lost sleep as soon as possible."", 'A baby monitor will alert you to any nighttime problems your parent may be having, and they will feel secure knowing that if they call\xa0in the middle of the night, you will hear them. Show them how the monitor works. If it\'s the bed that\'s keeping your father awake, consider getting a hospital bed. Medicare will pay for it if their doctor recommends it. A foam ""egg crate"" mattress will help prevent bedsores and can be purchased from any medical supply house. Rotate a new mattress once a month the first year and every season (four times a year) after that. A mattress should be replaced every eight to ten years. If they sleep in the same bed but Mom needs a firm mattress and Dad prefers something softer, consider getting two single beds and moving them next to each other. You can use king- or queen-sized bedding, so it looks like one bed. This allows many couples to feel comfortable without giving up intimacy.', 'A clock with brightly illuminated numbers can keep someone awake. Use the dimmer on the clock if it has one, turn the clock to the wall, or get a new clock. Some people have trouble sleeping because their biological clocks are waking them at weird times. To ""reset"" Dad\'s biological clock, have them get up in the morning at the time they are like to awaken each day and spend about ten minutes facing the sun. If your mother grinds their teeth at night -- a common condition called bruxism -- talk to the dentist. Mom might need a mouth guard.

Yoga is a great form of gentle exercise that improves the immune system and promotes well-being, among many other benefits. Weight training, tai chi, swimming, and low-impact aerobics are also generally beneficial to seniors. Make your own exercise video for your mother. They might hate the idea of staring at a nubile twenty-something while they do\xa0their stretching exercises, but what if, instead, they had an image of you or their granddaughter guiding them through the routine? If you own a video camera, don\'t pass up this opportunity to make each day more special for them. Set up an area of your Dad\'s home where they can exercise safely.

What hill?"").', 'If you can\'t go yourself, hire a reliable teen to take your parent for a walk. The outing might be less awkward if you give it a purpose, like a daily trip to the store for bagels and a newspaper. Gardening, housecleaning, and shopping can be considered exercise. Redefine the word exercise as needed. Things change. From time to time, review your loved one\'s exercise routine to make sure it\'s still appropriate. Encourage deep breathing. Most people forget to breathe when they exercise. Check with a doctor or physical therapist before your loved one embarks on any exercise routine. ""I\'ve heard that advice about a million times and was assured by our family doctor that Dad\'s calisthenics were just fine for him. But it never occurred to me to check back after he developed a minor ear infection that left him with a slight balancing problem.

Walking to your seats is enough to get the body moving, and the fresh air will do wonders for them. Bring your older parent to a physical therapist for advice and general guidance. If you can get Dad's doctor to recommend the visit, insurance will pay for it. If not, it'll be a worthy expense, given the possible benefits. All exercise routines, even walking, should start and end with a period of stretching. A stretch needs to be held for at least five seconds to be effective. If your father refuses to exercise, try to get them to at least work on one of the important muscle groups: arms, legs, shoulders, or back. Exercising to music is always more fun, especially if the music is your favorite. Make your loved one a special exercise tape of their favorite tunes. If your parent totally resists the idea of exercise, don't try to bully them into it."", ""The mall opens before the stores do, and in many areas, people have discovered that they're a great place to walk.

Exercise reduces stress. That's probably something you both need. Do it together. Consider a professional personal trainer. Even if it's too expensive to have one regularly, a couple sessions will get Mom started on the right track and allow them to develop an appropriate routine. It's a good idea for someone else to be around when your parent exercises, just in case there are problems. If you or a family member can't be there, this is a potential job for a responsible teen. An hour of brisk walking four times a week can drastically improve the quality of life for an older person -- or anyone else, for that matter."", 'Buy Mom a pedometer so they can measure their distance when they walk. Start a senior exercise class in your dad\'s neighborhood. A small group can pool their resources and hire a teacher just for them, at their convenience. If no one has a basement big enough, ask restaurant owners whether their private rooms, which are rarely used during the daytime, can be made available. Or, perhaps the local school can let them use part of the gym when it\'s not being used. Walking is still the best exercise there is. Learn to enjoy walking slowly with your loved one. ""When I first started taking Gramps out for short walks, I thought I\'d go crazy -- each block took a good half hour, which was often the length of a whole visit.

Also, water exercise classes are available at many swimming facilities. Dancing: it's good exercise, it's a great social activity, the music can be therapeutic, and it's a wonderful way to meet people. Find out what classes are available locally, and don't ignore those classes that are aimed at kids. Instructors at those classes might be willing to start offering adult classes if enough students can be gathered. Look into special exercise programs for older adults in the neighborhood. Visit the classes on your own before you suggest your parent joins. There are some good ones out there, but some can be depressing to those who are fairly vital. Squeezing balls of clay is good exercise for arthritic hands, as are therapeutic squeeze balls made just for that purpose. They're available at most drugstores. Older adults have found that weight lifting using relatively light weights strengthens the body, helps bone density, increases flexibility, and reassures them of their abilities. Always check with a doctor before your loved one embarks on any exercise program.""]"
62,The Brain and Essential Tremor,"['Essential tremor is a nerve disorder that causes shaking that you can’t control in different parts and on different sides of your body. It often affects areas like your hands, arms, head, larynx (voice box), tongue , and chin. The lower body is rarely involved. ET is not life-threatening unless it keeps someone from caring for themselves. Most people are able to live regular lives with this condition, although they may find it hard to do everyday things like eating, dressing, or writing. It’s only when the tremors become severe that they actually cause disability.', 'What Causes Essential Tremor? Doctors don’t understand the true cause of essential tremor, but it’s thought that the unusual electrical brain activity that causes it is processed through the thalamus. The thalamus is a structure deep in the brain that coordinates and controls muscle activity. Genes cause ET in half of all people with the condition. Someone who has ET will have up to a 50% chance of passing down the responsible gene to their child, but the child may never have symptoms. Although ET is more common in older people -- and symptoms become more serious with age -- it is not a part of the natural aging process.', 'Who Gets Essential Tremor? Essential tremor is the most common movement disorder, affecting up to 10 million people in the U.S. ET can happen at any age, but it most often appears during adolescence or in middle age (between ages 40 and 50).', ""What Are the Symptoms of Essential Tremor? The main symptoms of essential tremor include: Shaking for brief periods of time that you can’t control Shaking voice Nodding head Tremors that get worse during emotional stress Tremors that get worse when you move on purpose Tremors that lessen with rest Balance problems (in rare cases) Many other factors or diseases can also cause tremors, including Parkinson's disease , multiple sclerosis , fatigue after exercise , extreme emotional distress, brain tumors , some prescription drugs , metabolic problems, and alcohol or drug withdrawal."", ""Can Essential Tremor Increase the Risk for Other Illnesses? Essential tremor is linked to other illnesses. Other movement disorders, such as Parkinson's disease , have been associated with ET. Some reports have linked ET with migraine headaches . People with ET may also be at high risk of having dementia (particularly Alzheimer’s disease)."", ""Drugs that treat essential tremor may also make you more likely to become depressed. Some experts think there’s no increased risk for Parkinson's disease for people with ET. Instead, some people diagnosed with ET may be incorrectly diagnosed at first and later turn out to have Parkinson's."", 'How Is Essential Tremor Diagnosed? A neurologist or movement disorder specialist can usually diagnose essential tremor based on your symptoms and a complete neurological exam. There is no specific blood , urine, or other test used to diagnose ET. As part of the exam, your doctor may consider other causes of tremor, such as thyroid disease, too much caffeine , or medication side effects.', 'How Is Essential Tremor Treated? Mild essential tremor may not need treatment. But if ET causes problems in your everyday life or if you find it socially unacceptable, treatments may improve symptoms. These can include medications or surgery. Medications. Drugs that you take by mouth can make essential tremor less severe. They include gabapentin ( Neurontin ), primidone ( Mysoline ), propranolol ( Hemangeol , Inderal , Inderal XL , InnoPran XL ), and topiramate ( Topamax ). Other drug options include the benzodiazepines alprazolam ( Xanax ), clonazepam ( Klonopin ), diazepam ( Valium ), and lorazepam ( Ativan ). Botox shots may also be a treatment option. This treatment has been effective for vocal and head tremors. Adaptive devices. These are external devices that can help change or control how severe your tremors are. They may help anyone with ET, but people who have disabling tremors are generally not considered good candidates. The devices include neuromodulation devices that you wear and control yourself, and tremor cancellation devices that control hand tremors, allowing you to eat or write. Deep brain stimulation (DBS). People who have severe tremor despite medical therapy can get help from this surgical treatment. Your doctor implants an electrode in your thalamus and attaches it to a pacemaker-type device under the skin of your chest. The device causes tiny, painless shocks that disrupt faulty electrical messages in the brain. DBS offers moderate relief in about 90% of people who get it. It doesn’t destroy brain tissue, and it can be removed or adjusted. But you need brain surgery to put it in place, and some people have symptoms when it delivers a shock. MRI-guided focused high-intensity ultrasound . This uses magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to focus ultrasound to destroy tissue in the thalamus. The procedure is painless, with no cutting or drilling into the brain. You don’t need anesthesia, and you’re awake and responsive the whole time. But it doesn’t work for everyone, and any improvement in your tremors can fade over time. Thalamotomy. Less often, someone with ET may have surgery to destroy part of the thalamus. It’s usually done on only one side of your brain, to lower the risk of complications. Tremors will get better on the opposite side of your body. Biomechanical loading. External force is applied to a limb or muscle to control the tremor. Studies show that a repeat of this therapy can ease tremors.', 'Can Essential Tremor Be Prevented? Because we don’t know the exact cause of essential tremor, there is no way to prevent it. But knowing that ET has a genetic link gives researchers clues as they look for treatments and prevention.', 'Can Essential Tremor Be Cured? There is no cure for essential tremor, but treatments that ease symptoms may improve your quality of life. These include drugs and surgery that ease tremor. But not every treatment or procedure is effective for every person with ET. Your doctor will recommend a personal treatment plan, including lifestyle changes that may help reduce your tremors.']"
63,"Pressure Sores: Treatment, Stages, and Symptoms","['What Are Pressure Sores? You may know pressure sores by their more common name: bedsores. Also sometimes called pressure ulcers, they happen when you lie or sit in one position too long and the weight of your body against the surface of the bed or chair cuts off blood supply. You might get them if you\'re on bed rest or in a wheelchair. Your doctor may talk about the ""stage"" of your pressure sores. The stages are based on how deep the sores are, which can affect how they\'re treated. If found early, there\'s a good chance these sores will heal in a few days, with little fuss or pain . Without treatment, they can get worse.', 'Pressure Sores Causes Pressure sores happen when your skin is pressed against a surface (like a mattress or a cushion) for a long period. This makes it hard for blood flow to reach that area of skin. As a result, skin cells begin to die, and the area becomes sensitive. Pressure sores can show up in a few days or even just a few hours.', ""A few things contribute to pressure sores: Pressure. Even if it doesn't feel like you're putting a lot of weight on a certain body part, over time, the force adds up. The pressure squeezes your skin, making it hard for blood to flow through that area. Without proper blood flow, your skin can't get enough oxygen or nutrients. This weakens the skin and causes cells to die. Rubbing. Rubbing, even from blankets or clothing, can damage sensitive skin. This could be especially harmful if the skin is moist from sweat. Stretched skin. When two surfaces slide against each other, it can cause your skin to pull or stretch. For instance, you might slide down a raised bed, aggravating the skin on your tailbone. Common areas of pressure ulcers Pressure sores tend to form in bony parts of your body, like the skin covering your spine and tailbone. These places don't have a lot of fat or muscle padding. The places where you get them depend on your position."", ""If you spend most of your time in bed, you're most likely to find them on your: Head (where it rests against the pillow) Shoulder blades Hips Tailbone and butt Back of the knees Ankles Heels If you stay in a wheelchair for long periods, you might get them on your: Shoulder blades Spine Arms or legs (where they touch the chair) You also can get pressure sores from devices that press against your skin for long periods. For example, wearing an oxygen mask can lead to pressure sores on your nose, your ears, or the back of your head. Oral devices (like poor-fitting dentures) can cause sores in your mouth."", ""Pressure Sores Risk Factors Some people are more likely to get pressure sores than others. Things that can raise your risk of pressure sores include: Immobility. This is when you have difficulty moving. You might spend a lot of time in a position that puts pressure on a certain body part. Incontinence. This is when you can't control your bladder or bowels. Moisture from pee and poop could irritate your skin, especially if you're not able to clean up right away. Poor nutrition and hydration. Your skin (and the rest of your body) needs a healthy diet with plenty of nutrients and water. Without these, it will get weak and fragile. Loss of physical feeling. Pain, discomfort, and other sensations tell your body when it's time to shift position. Some health conditions, like spinal cord injuries, can dull your ability to feel. As a result, you might not realize when pressure builds up on a certain body part. Blood flow problems. Some conditions, like diabetes and vascular disease, make it hard for blood to travel throughout your body. This raises the risk that certain positions might cut off your blood flow, causing pressure sores. Thin or weakened skin. Wearing a cast or prosthetic device could cause your skin to weaken. This makes your skin more vulnerable to pressure and irritation."", 'What health conditions raise your risk of bedsores? Certain diseases make it hard to move or get out of bed. They might cause immobility, blood flow problems, and other things that raise your risk of pressure sores. These conditions include: Cancer Cerebral palsy Coma Dementia Diabetes Heart failure Kidney failure Malnutrition Paralysis Spinal cord injury or spina bifida Vascular problems', ""Pressure Sores Stages and Symptoms There are four stages of pressure sores from mild to severe: Stage I This is the mildest stage. These pressure sores only affect the upper layer of your skin. Symptoms: Pain, burning, or itching are common symptoms. The spot may also feel different from the surrounding skin: firmer or softer, warmer or cooler. You may notice a red area on your skin. If you have darker skin, the discolored area may be harder to see. The spot doesn't get lighter when you press on it or even 10-30 minutes after you stop pressing. This means less blood is getting to the area."", ""Stage II This happens when the sore digs deeper below the surface of your skin. Symptoms: Your skin is broken, has an open wound, or looks like a pus-filled blister. The skin around it may be discolored. The area is swollen, warm, and/or red. The sore may ooze clear fluid or pus. And it's painful. Stage III These sores have gone through the second layer of skin into the fat tissue. Symptoms: The sore looks like a crater and may have a bad odor. It may show signs of infection: red edges, pus, odor, heat, and/or drainage. The tissue in or around the sore is black if it has died. Stage IV These sores are the most serious. Some may even go so deep they affect your muscles, ligaments, and bones. Symptoms: The sore is deep and big. Skin has turned black and shows signs of infection—red edges, pus, odor, heat, and/or drainage. You may be able to see tendons, muscles, and bone."", ""Other stages In addition to the four main stages for bed sores, there are two others: Unstageable is when you can't see the bottom of the sore because it's covered in a layer of dead skin. Your doctor can only stage it once it's cleaned out. Suspected deep tissue injury is when the surface of the skin looks like a stage I or II sore, but underneath the surface, it's a stage III or IV sore."", ""Pressure Sores Diagnosis To diagnose a pressure sore, your doctor will examine your skin. They might ask questions like: When did the sore appear? Does it hurt? How often do you change positions? Have you ever had a pressure sore before? Your doctor will consider your symptoms. Then they'll determine whether you have a pressure sore, and if so, what stage it's in. They might take a picture to record its healing progress. If your doctor is worried you might have an infection, they might do: Blood tests Biopsies to take a sample of tissue for testing Imaging, such as an X-ray or MRI, to get a picture of what's happening under your skin"", 'Pressure Sores Complications When left untreated, pressure sores can lead to other problems such as: Skin infections. Open wounds can let bacteria in and lead to bacterial infections like cellulitis or septicemia. You might notice the area becoming warm, swollen, and inflamed. Sepsis. If left untreated, infections can lead to sepsis, when your body starts to attack its own tissues instead of fighting the bacteria causing the infection. Amputation. Sepsis can be so bad that you have to have a limb removed. Bacteria in your bloodstream. This can lead to serious problems like bacterial meningitis or endocarditis . These diseases affect the brain and heart. Bone and joint infections. Pressure sores can allow infections to enter nearby bones or joints. These kinds of infections can damage tissues and affect your ability to move. Cancer. Rarely, wounds that take a very long time to heal can turn into a type of skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma. Signs of an infected bedsore Infection can cause: Fluid leaking from the sore Fever Bad smell Warm skin near the wound Changes in skin color Swelling Pain', ""Pressure Sores Treatment How you treat a pressure sore depends on what stage it's in. Stage I The first and most important thing to do with any pressure sore is to stop the pressure. Change your position or use foam pads, pillows, or mattresses. If you spend a lot of time in bed, try to move at least once every 2 hours. If you're sitting, move every 15 minutes. You may need someone to help you."", 'Wash the sore with mild soap and water and dry it gently. It may help to eat a diet high in protein, vitamins A and C, and the minerals iron and zinc. These are all good for your skin. Also, drink plenty of water. Stage II Clean the wound with a saline (saltwater) solution and dry it gently. Keep the sore covered with a bandage. Ask your doctor what type is best—films, gauze, gel, foam, or medicated. If you see signs of an infection, such as pus, fever, or redness, tell your doctor.', ""Stage III Stage III sores will need more care, so you should see your doctor. They may remove any dead tissue. This is called debridement. They'll numb the surrounding skin first, then use a scalpel to remove the dead skin or special ointments to dissolve it. Your doctor also might prescribe antibiotics to fight infection. You may also be able to get a special bed or mattress through your insurance. Stage IV Tell your doctor right away. These wounds need immediate attention, and you may need surgery. Pressure sore medications Pressure sores can be painful. To help with the pain, you can try nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen (Advil) and naproxen sodium (Aleve). Take them before changing positions or cleaning your wound. Your doctor could also prescribe pain relievers in the form of a cream or ointment. If your bedsore becomes infected, you might need prescription antibiotics. Pressure sore surgical treatments If you have a large pressure sore that doesn't go away, you might need a surgery called a skin graft. The surgeon takes muscle or skin from a different part of your body and uses it to cover the sore. This closes the wound and cushions it."", ""Pressure Sores Prevention There are some easy ways to prevent pressure sores. The most important one is to regularly change positions. Here are some tips: Reposition yourself often. Move around every 15 minutes (if you're in a wheelchair) or every hour (if you're in bed). Don't be afraid to ask for help."", ""Get a specialized wheelchair. Look for chairs that you can tilt back, allowing you to shift your weight more easily. Use cushions. Cushions and specialized mattresses can help distribute your weight, relieving pressure. They also can support your body in comfortable positions. But don't use doughnut cushions—these actually build pressure on the surrounding area. Keep\xa0the head of your bed low. Don't raise the head of your bed (or tilt your pillows) to more than a 30° angle. This prevents you from sliding down the bed, which could strain the skin surrounding the tailbone. If possible, lift yourself. If you're in a wheelchair and have enough upper body strength, you can do wheelchair pushups. This is when you press your forearms against the arms of the chair to lift your body from the seat."", ""Other ways to prevent pressure sores include: Stay clean and dry. Even if you can't bathe regularly, use a daily cleansing towel to wipe away sweat, dirt, and other buildup. Pat dry when done. If you have incontinence, apply a moisture barrier ointment. This will protect your skin from pee and poop. Avoid irritating the skin. Look for buttons, zippers, bumps in the fabric, and other things that could cause rubbing. Wash your blankets and clothes frequently. Eat a healthy diet and drink plenty of water. Staying well-nourished and hydrated will help your skin stay strong. Keep an eye on your skin. Check yourself (or ask someone else to check) for signs of bedsores. The earlier you treat them, the quicker they will go away."", ""Pressure Sores Prognosis How quickly bedsores heal depends on how serious they are. In general, healing can take a few weeks or months. Usually, bedsores get better after treatment and don't cause any long-term problems, although your skin might be a little weaker in that area. But some severe sores might need surgery."", ""Takeaways Bedsores form when you lie or sit in one position for a long time. They can be mild to severe, depending on how long you've had them. To avoid them, change positions often (you might need someone to help you). Talk with your doctor about preventing and treating infected sores."", ""Pressure Sores FAQs How do you get rid of pressure sores? How you treat a pressure sore depends on its severity. Generally, you'll need to avoid putting pressure on that area and clean it regularly. More serious bedsores might need antibiotics (if they're infected) or surgery. What does a stage I pressure sore look like? During this early stage, your skin in the area of the sore may be red. It may also feel different to the touch than the rest of your skin—firmer or softer, or cooler or warmer. What does a stage II pressure sore look like? These pressure sores might cause broken skin, blistering, and pus. What is the cause of pressure sores? Pressure sores develop when an area of your skin experiences pressure, rubbing, or stretching for a long period.""]"
64,9 Things You Can Do to Prevent Carpal Tunnel Syndrome,"['If your job or favorite hobby puts strain on your hands and wrists, you might wonder if you have carpal tunnel syndrome . Maybe you’ve got some symptoms, like tingling or numbness in your fingers, and you want to make sure it doesn’t get worse. The good news is that there’s a lot you can do to protect yourself and prevent your symptoms from getting worse. Carpal tunnel syndrome is caused by pressure on your median nerve. This nerve gives you feeling in your thumb and all your fingers except your pinky. When the median nerve goes through your wrist, it passes through a narrow path -- the carpal tunnel -- that’s made of bone and ligament. If you get any swelling in your wrist, this tunnel gets squeezed and pinches your median nerve, which causes your symptoms. There’s no one, surefire way to prevent carpal tunnel syndrome. But if you reduce stress and strain on your hands and wrists as much as you can, you may keep it from getting worse.', '1. Try a Softer Touch Often in our daily routines, we get so used to doing things a certain way that we don’t even think about it. Many times, you may use more force than you need to get the job done. For instance, you might grip your tools too tightly when a firm hold is plenty. Or you may pound your computer keyboard when gentle keystrokes will do. As you go through your day, keep an eye on how tense your hands are and how much pressure you put on them. If you can back off even a little, your hands and wrists will thank you.', '2. Give Yourself a Break Step away from your work to bend or stretch your hands. A 10- to 15-minute break every hour is ideal. This is especially important if you use tools that vibrate or make you apply a lot of force.', '3. Stretch Often When you take those breaks (or any time throughout the day), try this simple stretch: Make a fist Slide your fingers up until they point straight out Repeat 5-10 times Or this one: Make a fist Release your fingers and fan them out. Stretch them as far as you can. Repeat 5-10 times', '4. Stay Neutral If you can, avoid bending your wrist all the way up or down. When you keep your wrist in a straight, neutral position, it takes the pressure off your median nerve. Wearing a wrist brace when you sleep can help you do this. It might also help to wear it during activities that trigger your symptoms.', '5. Switch It Up Try to avoid doing the same hand and wrist motions over and over again. For example, if you have a task that you always do with your right hand, do it with your left instead. Or, mix up your tasks as much as you can to give your muscles a break.', '6. Watch Your Posture While it’s natural to focus on your wrist and hands, how you hold the rest of your body can also make a difference. Poor posture may cause you to roll your shoulders forward. This sets off a chain reaction that shortens your neck and shoulder muscles, crunches the nerves in your neck, and makes wrist problems worse.', '7. Stay Warm It sounds simple, but it makes a difference. When you’re cold, pain and stiffness get worse. Even gloves with no fingers can be helpful because they keep your hands and wrists warm and loose.', '8. Talk to Your Supervisor If your work triggers your symptoms, ask you manager about changing up your work space. You may be able to alter anything from your workstation setup to tool handles to how tasks get done to see if it helps your symptoms. You might also be able to trade off with co-workers so you can avoid the same task over and over. If you work at a computer, try these things: Adjust your keyboard position so you don’t have to bend your wrists when you type. Keep your elbows close to your side as you type.', '9. See an Occupational Therapist This medical professional may be able to: Show you exercises to help stretch and strengthen your hand and wrist muscles Show you how to change your routine motions in a way that eases stress on your hands and wrists']"
65,"Caring for Parents, Keeping Them Healthy","[""Sound Body, Sound Mind When caring for an older adult, it's important not to overlook routine care -- stuff that seems obvious but that may not be on your radar. Here is a rundown of what to keep in mind. Everyone needs regular checkups. But some older adults (and young ones, too) reason that since they just saw the doctor last month about that sinus problem, they don't need to go again. A visit to the doctor for a specific problem, however, doesn't take the place of a complete checkup. Make sure your parent is eating a balanced diet. Accompany them to the market to guide shopping choices, teach how to read labels, and discuss the importance of all the food groups, vitamins, fiber, and calcium . ID jewelry with pertinent medical alert and contact information should be worn by all older adults. There is a huge variety of bracelets, pendants, and even watchbands available. One company that sells them is American Medical Identifications ."", 'Know your mother\'s baseline -- what\'s ""normal"" for them. Some older adults have a lower normal body temperature than 98.6 degrees Farenheit, and others have had chronic problems throughout their lives. Be familiar with Mom\'s ""default setting,"" and be aware of changes. Know that baselines change as a person ages. If, for instance, they go\xa0through surgery, chances are they will come out of it with a new baseline. Know your loved one\'s complete medical history and keep a record of it to be taken to doctor\'s appointments and checked often. Just as important is to know your own medical history, in case genetic issues arise or transplants or transfusions become necessary. Unless told otherwise by your doctor, you should each be drinking eight glasses of water a day. Did you know that dehydration is a common cause of many disorders in older adults, including circulation problems? Make sure liquids are available all day long. How about an attractive thermos for the bedside or a water cooler in the living room and on the patio? Get one on casters so it can be moved from room to room.', ""Blood pressure is an issue among most older adults. Get a reliable sphygmomanometer (a blood pressure monitor) and teach your loved one -- and yourself -- to take blood pressure readings . Some pharmacies take blood pressure readings and teach you to do it yourself for free. Local community service organizations such as the Kiwanis or Lions Club often offer free eye exams and eyeglasses to older adults who can't easily afford them. Your Area Agency on Aging will tell you what's available in your area. Free dental care is available from local dental schools, and often, a low income is not even a requirement. Contact the dental college in your area. Keep a diary of your parent's health progress. If your loved one is running a temperature or experiencing any other condition that may require a doctor's care, keep hourly notes and temperature readings for later reference. Wash your hands often when caring for your parents. Remind them to wash theirs, too. Keep plenty of moisturizer around. Dry, chapped hands are especially common in winter. When you visit department stores, ask the people at the cosmetics counters for free samples, and keep these around the house to be used often."", ""Even natural supplements can sometimes be a bad mix with certain medications or cause side effects on their own. Ask your mom if they are taking anything like herbs or other supplements . Check them out with their doctor, no matter how harmless you believe they are. Foot massagers are great for promoting blood circulation and avoiding cracked heals, which can sometimes split. This is especially important in people with diabetes. A digital thermometer is easier to use than a mercury thermometer. Take temperatures using the armpit if your parent has breathing problems or is easily confused. If Mom has breathing problems and uses an inhaler, keep several around your house and hers, in the car, and so forth. Many trips to the bathroom may indicate a urinary tract infection , common among older people who don't always get the fluids they need. Consult a doctor immediately."", ""Consult a podiatrist immediately for corns, calluses , bunions , blisters , sores, and infections, or ingrown, hard, brittle, split, or discolored toenails. If your senior has problem feet, a weekly trip to a salon for a pedicure makes a great outing. Most salons have special discount days for older adults. Don't forget to ask about these."", 'Keep a checklist -- a ""report card"" -- and update it periodically to keep track of how your parent is doing with meal preparation, housework, mobility (in and out of the house), laundry, shopping, money issues, medications, bathing, dressing, and eating. These are key activities of daily living (ADLs), and difficulty with them indicates there may be trouble. If your parent or parents live in a multilevel home but has problems with stairs, consider a chair lift. They are not inexpensive, but they can be cheaper than moving and will help keep your parent independent for a longer time. For someone who sits a lot, an ergonomic chair that offers greater lumbar support and adjustable features (chair height, armrest height, seat depth) can make a huge difference in overall health. Ergonomic chairs come in all kinds of models and varying prices. If an ergonomic chair is not an option, make sure your father\'s chair has an adjustable height feature, the seat depth is approximately two-thirds the length of their thighs and buttocks, the back is at least fourteen inches high, and the armrests are no more than nine inches high.', 'Bad posture can complicate back problems and limit mobility. Is Mom walking as upright as they used to? Is Dad favoring one leg over the other for some reason? Sometimes the answer can be as simple as a new pair of shoes. Osteoporosis is a serious problem for older women, leading to height changes and serious (sometimes deadly) fractures . Schedule your parent for a bone density test , and encourage weight-bearing exercise (walking, light weights, gardening). Make sure Mom gets plenty of calcium (the new "" chocolate chew"" supplements are delicious), and ask their doctor about hormone replacement therapy or other treatments.', ""Make sure Mom has a mammogram annually. If there are precautionary measures that must be remembered, make a checklist and post it in a place where it can't possibly be missed. But change the list and its location from time to time so that it doesn't get taken for granted after a while. If you use a dry erase board or a chalkboard, ask your parent to check off the points as they are followed."", 'The older you get, the more you are affected by alcohol. On the other hand, a glass of wine now and then has been known to be beneficial for the heart . Check with your loved one\'s doctor for a good rule of thumb. In the meantime, locate some ""zero-proof"" recipes and dress them up -- tiny umbrellas and all -- for a special or even not-so-special occasion. Don\'t minimize changes in your parents\' health, even if they seem minor. These changes may be accompanied by fear, which can exacerbate even a minor problem. Address your parents\' fears; be positive about your ability to find a solution. Anemia is very common among older adults, usually resulting from either a loss of blood or a poor diet. Check with the doctor as to whether iron supplements (taken with orange juice or with vitamin C for better absorption) might be in order. Help prevent infections by keeping antibacterial wet wipes handy at all times. Keep boxes of them around the house; individually wrapped ones can go in your purse or wallet and in the car.', 'Avoid foot fungus by keeping feet clean and dry. That means changing socks daily and shoes often. It\'s also a good idea to let feet ""air out"" once a day. Nylon or synthetic socks are more likely to make feet sweat. Cotton is better. If socks are too tight at the tops, they can interfere with circulation. Cut notches into them to make sure they don\'t bind. Teach your loved one to respect pain. If something hurts, there\'s a reason for it. Bedsores -- or pressure sores -- result when there is constant pressure on an area where bones are close to the skin \'s surface. Be on the lookout for problems in these most vulnerable areas: the back of the head, the shoulder blades, the elbows, the base of the spine, the hips, the heels, and the ankles . Consult a doctor if you see red, cracking, or dried skin. In the meantime, encourage Dad to move about when they can, and don\'t leave them sitting or lying on a damp surface. Make sure linens are not irritating, and wash them often. Always wear (disposable) rubber gloves when you suspect you might have any kind of skin disorder, such as a rash , an infection, or a lesion of any type.', 'Eating and the Older Adult It\'s a good idea to accompany your mother to the supermarket occasionally to point out new products and to make sure they are shopping wisely. Encourage them to read labels for salt content, sugar, and other health considerations. If they resist, urge them to at least heed fat content. Generally, none of us should be taking in more than 30% of our daily calorie intake in the form of fat, and of that, no more than 10% should come from saturated fats. Olive oil is a good source of unsaturated fat. Frozen foods, which are processed right after they are harvested, often retain more vitamins than ""fresh"" vegetables, which may sit on shelves for days before getting to the supermarket. When ordering packaged meals from local agencies, ask for extra vegetables. Also, consider supplementing the meal with a homemade side dish. Would a small refrigerator or a mini microwave in the bedroom or family room make it easier for Dad to have nutritious snacks all day long?', ""If shopping is a problem, maybe you can fit an extra freezer in Mom's home somewhere that will allow them to stock up. Does your grandfather need help with cooking? Contact Meals on Wheels of America to find a local program that will deliver free meals to their home. All adults older than sixty are eligible. Note that Meals on Wheels doesn't deliver on weekends, so you'll have to make other arrangements. Can a neighbor help? How about a local church or other religious organization? Or ask a local favorite restaurant to deliver a couple of meals. If your father has vision problems, put liquid in a see-through cup or glass so they can see the liquid. If your mother's on a special diet, write the day's menu on a blackboard and ask them to check each item off as it's consumed. Fax a weekly shopping list to your parent's local market and ask for it to be delivered. You can even pay for it over the phone with your credit card. Find easy recipes that allow your parent to cook with canned and packaged foods -- they combine quickly and are quite tasty. There are a variety of cookbooks in this category. Mom might enjoy Desperation Dinners , by Beverly Mills and Alicia Ross; for Dad, how about A Man, a Can, a Plan , by David Joachim."", 'There are cookbooks available with easy recipes suitable for special diets (diabetes, heart disease), cooking for one, or microwave cooking. Browse the bookstore or search Amazon.com for the one that will suit your parents\' tastes. When you call, casually ask your parent to tell you what they have been eating. ""What did you have for dinner last night?"" is better than ""How\'s your appetite?"" If Mom is passing up making the meals they once loved because ""it\'s just one person,"" get them a small wok and a cooking-for-one cook-book. Schedule visits at mealtimes so they\'ll have an excuse to cook. If asked, the grocer might break up packages to sell smaller quantities to your parent, like a half-dozen eggs, two potatoes, or just a few slices of bread (the grocer can use the rest of the loaf to make sandwiches). Ultra-pasteurized milk that comes in cardboard cartons has a very long shelf life. Just make sure your parent chills it before drinking and refrigerates it after it\'s opened.', 'If your loved one takes a long time to eat, arrange for them to start their meal before everyone else. Be especially patient at mealtimes; older adults often eat much more slowly than what you may be used to. Try to minimize distractions at mealtimes, and don\'t bring up stressful subjects. ""We usually have dinner with my grandmother on Sunday nights. It\'s nice, but sometimes she can go on autopilot, where instead of having a conversation, she just has a long monologue, a riff on everything. You can\'t get a word in edgewise. That can be frustrating, but as my father pointed out, she spends a lot of her week alone, bottling up thoughts and ideas, and so when she gets a chance to unload, she needs to let it all out."" -Ilene Klausner A person who is easily confused might have an easier mealtime if you serve one course at a time and clear each one away before serving the next. A solid-color tablecloth, as opposed to a patterned one, will minimize mealtime distractions.', 'Maybe your parent or grandparent just hates eating in the kitchen. Try moving to the dining room or even a space outdoors. Don\'t ever wrap dentures in napkins, assuming you will retrieve them after the meal. Chances are they\'ll be thrown out. Freeze small containers of your leftovers from home to share with your parent. Label them with the date and contents. Freeze sauces, soups, and bouillon in ice cube trays so that individual servings can be popped out and heated. Make sure that your parent or grandparent has access to lots of healthy, easy-to-eat snacks, such as berries, bagels, pitas, cheese, raisins, crackers, energy bars, or apple, melon, or orange slices. If Mom\'s appetite is lagging, find out if they have a taste or yen for something special. Experiment with old recipes to make them more palatable and ""legal"" (use lactose-free milk, salt and sugar substitutes, ground meat instead of cubed, or yogurt instead of cream, but first consult a doctor about the interaction of these substitutes with any medications). There are tons of books on the subject and most have recipes. Consult them.', 'If your loved one is having trouble gaining or maintaining weight, pack their diet with liquid calories. Fruit juices, milk, and milk alternatives such as soy, rice, and nut milks are high in nutrients and calories and are much less filling than solid foods. Smoothies, yogurt shakes, and protein drinks are a little more filling, but may still make a good meal alternative. Respect your father\'s tastes. If they have\xa0hated yogurt all their life, don\'t start feeding it to them now just because they are less able to resist. A water filter makes a great gift for an older parent or grandparent. Four or five smaller meals during the day can be more manageable than three large ones. This approach has the added benefit of keeping blood sugar levels more even throughout the day. If your parent has vision problems, use the ""clock"" method of serving food: the main dish is right in front of them at ""six o\'clock,"" the starch dish is farthest and directly opposite at ""twelve o\'clock,"" and so on.', 'When family and friends call and ask what gift they can bring, suggest prepared foods. (If your parent gets Meals on Wheels deliveries, save the goodies for the weekend.) Use plastic bibs at mealtime. ""Dad flipped when he saw Mom come at him with a bib! He was furious and refused to wear it. \'I\'m not a baby,\' he screamed. So the next night when we sat down to eat, all of us -- the kids, me, my husband, and his parents -- wore bibs. We all wound up laughing about it, and Dad admitted that it wasn\'t such a big deal after all. We promised never to make him wear it in restaurants, unless, of course, he ordered the lobster."" -Vonda Giraldo It\'s OK to bring a special meal to a restaurant for your parent and ask to have it microwaved for you, just as long as everyone else is ordering off the menu. Waiters and waitresses want to help you; tell them what you need privately, to avoid embarrassment. And a good chef, if they are not too busy, can accommodate anyone. Show your appreciation, and tip accordingly.', ""Dry food can be difficult to swallow. Use sauces generously, but learn to make healthy versions. Use flexible straws. For those who refuse regular meals, keep healthy snacks (fruits, nutritious cookies, cut-up vegetables) available around the house. Finger foods are best. Be creative -- but not overbearing -- in your coaxing efforts. Try using children's non-spill cups with covers or sports drink containers with a straw. Make mealtime more special by using fancy plates and napkins. For some, it's easier to cut food with scissors than a knife and fork. If Mom can't cut their meat any longer, avoid embarrassment by cutting it for them in the kitchen before you serve. Soft and pureed foods don't have to be bland and tasteless. Find out which herbs and spices make an otherwise bland dish interesting. You might also serve the following in colorful combinations: cereal puddings and gelatin cooked and creamed vegetables cheese soups and stews egg salad and tuna and other fish salads tabouli, baba ganoush, and hummus cooked fish sushi pasta stewed fruit egg rolls, cut up chicken nuggets scrambled eggs and omelettes pancakes and French toast rice and risotto yogurt meat loaf"", 'Baby food is great if you need to get a meal together in a hurry. The fruit selections are delicious! Get a copy of The Non-Chew Cookbook , by Randy J. Wilson. No one likes to eat alone. If Mom insists that you partake of their bland, pureed diet, consider bringing along your own snacks at mealtime. Too many items on the table can be confusing. Keep condiments to a minimum. ""My mother hated dinnertime and often refused to settle down for it. So we started a routine of getting a little dressed up for dinner each night -- she wears a nice brooch and one of her many scarves, and she likes to carry a purse -- and now she looks forward to what\'s become her favorite part of our day."" -Michaela Kevis Freely make use of microwaveable prepackaged foods. You can stock up on them and put them in the freezer after marking each with the day of the week when it should be eaten.', 'If your loved one can\'t swallow thin liquids, someone has probably recommended Thick-It, a tasteless powder that thickens hot and cold liquids. The canister is bulky, so keep small supplies of Thick-It in your bag to use on outings. If Dad\'s not supposed to drink unthickened liquid, don\'t cheat, not even ""just this once."" Older adults should always eat sitting up. Take your parent to lunch, even if you\'re at work. Call at lunchtime, and you can eat together -- you at the desk, they at home in the kitchen. But remember that it\'s dangerous for an older person (or anyone else) to talk while chewing. Your parent\'s peak period of digestion (when it\'s easiest to digest food) is midday. Plan the large meal for that time of day, and keep supper light. When feeding your father, only put one teaspoon of food in their mouth at once. Alternate spoonfuls of solids and liquids. Plan your mother\'s weekly menu ahead of time so shopping for all meals can be done at once. Copy their recipes onto cards and write the shopping list for each dish on the backs. Take the cards with you when you go shopping.', ""Older adults who seem to have endless appetites often forget they have just eaten. Put stickers on the clock for mealtimes so they can see how long it is until the next meal. Making small nutritious snacks available throughout the day is also helpful. Your parent should never lie down right after a meal -- that is the most common cause of indigestion. (Eating too fast is the second most common cause.) Make sure Mom sits or stands for at least an hour after they eat. Many medications leave an awful taste in the mouth that is far worse than anything you can imagine. They can make sugar taste like salt, and some favorite foods become completely inedible. Be especially patient during this time as you try new things to see what works. In the meantime, a lollipop may help your loved one after they have\xa0eaten something distasteful. (Don't give sucking candies to anyone who might easily swallow them whole.) You can get someone to come to the house just to feed meals to your parent. Contact your Area Agency on Aging."", 'Even if Mom isn\'t making use of the local senior center, they can attend every day just for meals. If salt is an issue, there are a bunch of flavorful seasoning substitutes on the market. ""I bribed Mom to eat toward the end -- it was the only way I could get her to take anything. I actually gave her a quarter for every meal. The funny thing is, I forgot all about this. Then, after she passed away and we were going through her bedroom, I found jars of quarters under her bed! It all added up to over $150, which we donated to the local food bank, which is exactly where I knew she\'d want it to go. It helped give us closure to know that the money that helped feed our mother would now feed others."" -Brenda Bienvenuti There are tons of special utensils that can make eating a lot easier; a combination fork and knife for one-handed eating, a tilted spoon for someone with hand problems, or a two-handled mug for easier drinking are available from the many suppliers of special-needs items. You can also buy plate guards that keep food from sliding off. B Independent offers a wide range of such products.', ""Jews, Christians, Sikhs, Muslims, and Hindus all incorporate fasting into various rituals and celebrations. If your parent is observant, but you suspect they may not be physically up to the fast, speak to their doctor or spiritual counselor, who can talk to them about reasonable exemptions from fasting. Diet supplements like Ensure are widely used in hospitals and nursing homes. Keep them cooled. Put a few cans on ice in the morning, and make them available all day long. A glass of wine, if it's allowed by your Mom's doctor, can stimulate the appetite."", 'Sleep and Older Adults If Grandma has trouble sleeping (and is not bedridden), encourage them to spend as little ""awake time"" as possible in bed. Reading, watching TV, and so forth, should be done in a favorite chair, while bed is for sleep only. Going to sleep and waking up at about the same time each day will also help train their body for better sleep overall.', ""Older adults should avoid oversleeping in the morning. It leads to having trouble falling asleep later, and the cycle of insomnia begins. If Dad can't fall asleep within fifteen minutes of getting into bed, suggest them to get up for a while and do something calming, and then try again later. Don't take sleep disruption lightly. It can be caused by an improper dose of medication, an illness, or a psychological problem. Talk about it with your loved one's doctor. Many drugs, including Halcion and even the antidepressants that are supposed to make their life better, can cause terrifying nightmares. If your father wakes with night terrors, be reassuring. Show them that there's no danger nearby, but avoid arguing. If they insist\xa0that something (or someone) woke them, let them know that whatever the trouble was, it's gone now. People of any age who have difficulty sleeping should avoid exercise in the late afternoon and evening. Try morning walks instead. Avoid caffeine, not just in the evening but at any time of day. Aside from coffee, tea, and cola, look out for caffeine in chocolate, non-cola soft drinks, and some pain relievers. And while decaffeinated coffee has less caffeine than regular, it's not caffeine-free."", 'Alcohol can make your senior drowsy at first, but it hurts healthy sleep in the long run by disturbing the sleep cycle, making sleep less restful, and making them more likely to wake up during the night. As with practically everything, ""A good laugh and a long sleep are the two best cures."" -Irish proverb Maintain a sleep diary to note sleep patterns. The doctor will find this information useful if you need to consult with her, and you might discover patterns you weren\'t aware of: Is sleeping a problem the night before the family comes to visit? Is this about anxiety or excitement? Visit the National Sleep Foundation for more information. If there are serious issues that require discussion, don\'t bring these up right before bedtime. Avoid arguments. Some people swear by a teaspoon of honey in a cup of hot water before bedtime. Others go for warm milk with a little cinnamon. But if liquids are a problem before bed, find a different solution. A foot bath or massage right before bed can help.', ""Get dark-lined (blackout) shades for people who don't sleep well, and block out disturbing noise with a fan or a white noise machine. Some models have a choice of sounds that mimic ocean waves, the patter of raindrops, and other soothing sounds. Aromatherapy using lavender candles and potpourri can be very relaxing. Try a couple drops of lavender oil in a bath or on the corner of your parent's pillow. You can even buy soft microwavable products that warm up potpourri inside. Change the linens often. Everyone enjoys fresh sheets. You can even buy lavender water to put in the wash. It's sold in a lot of home stores and catalogs these days. Unpleasant odors can interfere with sleep. Use potpourri and make sure the air in the room has a chance to circulate. When Mom's out of the room for a while, open the windows or light a scented candle. Create a sleep ritual before bedtime and follow this every evening. If you live far away, you can still call at bedtime to wish your parents sweet dreams."", ""Cotton pajamas and sheets are less irritating than synthetics.

It's a fairly common condition that can often be treated with medication, iron supplements, and exercise. Is this what's keeping your loved one awake? Find out more online and talk to your doctor. Does Dad's snoring rock the house? Is Grandma really sleepy in the morning and drowsy during the day? They may have sleep apnea, a disorder in which the person stops breathing at points during sleep. Consistent loud snoring, observed episodes of not breathing, and morning and daytime sleepiness are some of the warning signs. Men, people who are over forty, and people who are overweight are all at higher risk, but anyone can have it, and it's more common than diabetes. Sleep apnea can lead to insomnia, high blood pressure, weight gain, headaches, memory problems, excessive drowsiness, depression, impotence -- the list goes on."", ""Make sure the mattress your father sleeps on is comfortable and right for them. Soft beds are nice, but maybe they need\xa0more support. It's easier to rise from a firm mattress. Some people are just not morning people. If getting your parent up every morning is a problem and you already have enough to do at that hour, let them stay in bed until midmorning, if they like, and get them up after the family has gone off to work and school. While it may be tempting to take naps, they should be avoided if they interfere with getting a good night's sleep. Arrange calming activities before bedtime; this is a time for reading, soft music, and soothing conversation. Have your loved one spend some time in pajamas before settling in to sleep. Saying prayers together before bedtime can be a wonderful ritual. Maybe Mom can't sleep because they have issues they can't talk about. Try to discuss this with them, or suggest they discuss the problem with another member of the family or a professional."", ""Remind your senior to go to the bathroom before going to sleep. If they get\xa0up often at night to go to the bathroom, suggest that they don't drink any liquids for three or four hours before bedtime. On the other hand, don't skimp too much on fluids during the day because you want to cut down on bathroom visits. Older adults often become dehydrated, which leads to painful (but common) urinary tract infections. Learn sleep techniques and teach them to your senior: Listen to your own breath and count breaths. Get comfortable, close your eyes, and begin breathing slowly but normally, then count each exhalation, either starting at one or counting back from one hundred. Practice progressive muscle relaxation by tensing and relaxing one limb at a time. Make a fist and clench your right arm, while keeping the left relaxed; then relax the right arm. Repeat with the left arm, then each leg. Use visualization techniques to picture yourself in a perfect, relaxing place, such as a quiet beach or lakeside. Try a tape or CD that will guide you through a relaxation exercise or visualization. There are many available. You can even make your own. Make up for lost sleep as soon as possible."", 'A baby monitor will alert you to any nighttime problems your parent may be having, and they will feel secure knowing that if they call\xa0in the middle of the night, you will hear them. Show them how the monitor works. If it\'s the bed that\'s keeping your father awake, consider getting a hospital bed. Medicare will pay for it if their doctor recommends it. A foam ""egg crate"" mattress will help prevent bedsores and can be purchased from any medical supply house. Rotate a new mattress once a month the first year and every season (four times a year) after that. A mattress should be replaced every eight to ten years. If they sleep in the same bed but Mom needs a firm mattress and Dad prefers something softer, consider getting two single beds and moving them next to each other. You can use king- or queen-sized bedding, so it looks like one bed. This allows many couples to feel comfortable without giving up intimacy.', 'A clock with brightly illuminated numbers can keep someone awake. Use the dimmer on the clock if it has one, turn the clock to the wall, or get a new clock. Some people have trouble sleeping because their biological clocks are waking them at weird times. To ""reset"" Dad\'s biological clock, have them get up in the morning at the time they are like to awaken each day and spend about ten minutes facing the sun. If your mother grinds their teeth at night -- a common condition called bruxism -- talk to the dentist. Mom might need a mouth guard. Keep familiar, favorite photos at the bedside to calm Mom in case they wake\xa0up confused about where they are. If they travel\xa0or have to spend some time in the hospital, keep these same items at their bedside there for continuity.', 'Exercise and Older Adults Nowhere is the saying, ""use it or lose it,"" more meaningful than among older adults. Aside from its cardiovascular benefits, exercise combats depression and osteoporosis, reduces the risk of falling, cuts down on healing time when there are injuries and illnesses, and generally improves lifestyle. Encourage your grandmother to stick to a routine.', 'Ask your older relative to keep an exercise log and consult it often. Compliment their progress and celebrate breakthroughs. Yoga is a great form of gentle exercise that improves the immune system and promotes well-being, among many other benefits. Weight training, tai chi, swimming, and low-impact aerobics are also generally beneficial to seniors. Make your own exercise video for your mother. They might hate the idea of staring at a nubile twenty-something while they do\xa0their stretching exercises, but what if, instead, they had an image of you or their granddaughter guiding them through the routine? If you own a video camera, don\'t pass up this opportunity to make each day more special for them. Set up an area of your Dad\'s home where they can exercise safely. Make it special: get an attractive exercise mat and maybe even hang up an inspirational poster. Get them colorful workout wear or a funny T-shirt (""Over the hill? What hill?"").', 'If you can\'t go yourself, hire a reliable teen to take your parent for a walk. The outing might be less awkward if you give it a purpose, like a daily trip to the store for bagels and a newspaper. Gardening, housecleaning, and shopping can be considered exercise. Redefine the word exercise as needed. Things change. From time to time, review your loved one\'s exercise routine to make sure it\'s still appropriate. Encourage deep breathing. Most people forget to breathe when they exercise. Check with a doctor or physical therapist before your loved one embarks on any exercise routine. ""I\'ve heard that advice about a million times and was assured by our family doctor that Dad\'s calisthenics were just fine for him. But it never occurred to me to check back after he developed a minor ear infection that left him with a slight balancing problem. It turned out that even some of the neck rolls he was doing were affecting his ability to stand up without getting dizzy."" -Bari Meyer', ""If your grandfather isn't motivated to exercise, take them\xa0to a ball game to remind them of what it was like to have the wind blow through their hair (when they had hair). Walking to your seats is enough to get the body moving, and the fresh air will do wonders for them. Bring your older parent to a physical therapist for advice and general guidance. If you can get Dad's doctor to recommend the visit, insurance will pay for it. If not, it'll be a worthy expense, given the possible benefits. All exercise routines, even walking, should start and end with a period of stretching. A stretch needs to be held for at least five seconds to be effective. If your father refuses to exercise, try to get them to at least work on one of the important muscle groups: arms, legs, shoulders, or back. Exercising to music is always more fun, especially if the music is your favorite. Make your loved one a special exercise tape of their favorite tunes. If your parent totally resists the idea of exercise, don't try to bully them into it."", ""The mall opens before the stores do, and in many areas, people have discovered that they're a great place to walk. Aisles are nice and wide, and it's temperature-controlled.It's also a great way to meet people. Make sure security has arrived on duty by the time your parent or grandparent gets there. Exercise reduces stress. That's probably something you both need. Do it together. Consider a professional personal trainer. Even if it's too expensive to have one regularly, a couple sessions will get Mom started on the right track and allow them to develop an appropriate routine. It's a good idea for someone else to be around when your parent exercises, just in case there are problems. If you or a family member can't be there, this is a potential job for a responsible teen. An hour of brisk walking four times a week can drastically improve the quality of life for an older person -- or anyone else, for that matter."", 'Buy Mom a pedometer so they can measure their distance when they walk. Start a senior exercise class in your dad\'s neighborhood. A small group can pool their resources and hire a teacher just for them, at their convenience. If no one has a basement big enough, ask restaurant owners whether their private rooms, which are rarely used during the daytime, can be made available. Or, perhaps the local school can let them use part of the gym when it\'s not being used. Walking is still the best exercise there is. Learn to enjoy walking slowly with your loved one. ""When I first started taking Gramps out for short walks, I thought I\'d go crazy -- each block took a good half hour, which was often the length of a whole visit. I soon learned to appreciate the value of slowing down my day this way, and seeing the world this way brought us closer together."" -Steve Fein Yoga classes can be beneficial to both you and your loved one. Consider taking classes together. If your parent hates the idea of walking, ask them to help you by running certain errands for you (""Dad, could you return this to the library for me?"").', ""Swimming is often an option for older adults who have lost mobility. Also, water exercise classes are available at many swimming facilities. Dancing: it's good exercise, it's a great social activity, the music can be therapeutic, and it's a wonderful way to meet people. Find out what classes are available locally, and don't ignore those classes that are aimed at kids. Instructors at those classes might be willing to start offering adult classes if enough students can be gathered. Look into special exercise programs for older adults in the neighborhood. Visit the classes on your own before you suggest your parent joins. There are some good ones out there, but some can be depressing to those who are fairly vital. Squeezing balls of clay is good exercise for arthritic hands, as are therapeutic squeeze balls made just for that purpose. They're available at most drugstores. Older adults have found that weight lifting using relatively light weights strengthens the body, helps bone density, increases flexibility, and reassures them of their abilities. Always check with a doctor before your loved one embarks on any exercise program.""]"
66,What Are Common Causes of Poisoning in Children?,"['Poisoning at Home Children are endlessly curious and want to explore, touch, and taste everything they find. Common causes of poisoning in children are in daily use in most households. Recognizing the signs of child poisoning, knowing how to contact the poison control center, and knowing about child poisoning prevention in your home can prevent tragedies. Out of reach and out of sight are both necessary to prevent child poisoning. Poisoning in children usually happens at home and is accidental. Some common causes include medicine, cleaning products, and alcohol, which can be toxic in children as their bodies are not as developed as those of adults and they have less defense against the effects of the poison. (Photo credit: Redpepper1982/Dreamstime)', 'Symptoms of Poisoning Learn the signs of potential poisoning in children, which can include: A hard time breathing A hard time\xa0speaking Dizziness Unconsciousness Foaming or burning of the mouth Cramps Nausea Vomiting', 'Causes of Poisoning Poisoning in children usually happens at home, when they take in a poisonous substance, breathe it in, or their skin is exposed to it. The poisoning is usually accidental and involves children under the age of 5. Some common causes of poisoning in children include medicine, cleaning products, and alcohol. These substances can be toxic in children as their bodies are not as developed as those of adults and they have less defense against the effects of the poison.', ""Medicine Poisoning Medicines are the most common cause of poisoning in children. Several medicines you or a family member are taking can be dangerous to children. Opioids and barbiturates are well-known dangers, but medicines for high blood pressure, mental health, and diabetes are also hazardous. A single tablet can be fatal for a small child. Many medicines prescribed to your child could be harmful at higher doses. Your pediatrician will weigh your child and prescribe a safe and effective dose. Always check the label before giving a dose to ensure you're getting it right. Never use a household spoon for liquid medicines. Use the marked dropper, measuring cup, or other dosing device supplied with the medicine. Store your child's medicines securely. Liquid medicines are often sweet, and a child getting hold of the bottle might consume a large amount. If more than one adult is giving medicines to your child, good communication is essential to avoid double dosing."", ""Medicine safety These guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics will keep children safe: Keep all medicines in their original containers, which usually have child safety caps. Nothing is childproof. Store medicines high up, where children cannot reach or see. For dangerous medicines, consider locks on the cabinet. Children who crawl eat anything they find on the floor. If you drop a pill, don't stop looking until you find it. Get rid of unused medicines, using safe disposal methods. Know basic first aid and have the poison control center number available. If medication is dropped or spilled, sweep and/or vacuum the area to be sure no medicine was left out."", 'Pesticide Poisoning After medicines, pesticides are the most common cause of child poisoning in some parts of the world.\xa0In the U.S., pesticide poisoning is believed to be rare, perhaps because only insecticides are considered. Fumigants, rodenticides, herbicides, fungicides, and other products are all pesticides. You might be using some to control weeds in your garden or spray in your home. Most pesticides contain compounds from the chemical classes carbamates, organophosphates, pyrethrins, and pyrethroids, or organochlorine compounds. The symptoms of each are different, but these are all very dangerous. If you suspect your child has consumed a pesticide, you should rush them to an emergency room.', ""Cleaning Product Poisoning Most cleaning agents contain caustic agents, which are chemicals that can burn people's eyes, skin, and linings of the nose, throat, mouth, and lungs. Poisoning from these strong bases can also hurt your child's digestive tract and cause other serious injuries, even in small amounts.\xa0Many sanitizers contain benzalkonium or sodium hypochlorite, compounds that can be very toxic if inhaled. Keep them in a locked cabinet, and use them when children aren't around."", 'Alcohol Poisoning Children may find alcoholic drinks and consume them. Sanitizers, perfumes, over-the-counter cold medicines, and mouthwash also contain alcohol. At young ages, alcohol ingestion causes low blood glucose levels, seizures, and coma.', 'Drugs of Abuse Children consuming illegal drugs may have seizures, respiratory depression, changes in being responsive or alert, and unconsciousness. Keep them locked up or out of the house completely.', ""Carbon Monoxide Poisoning Carbon monoxide is an odorless, colorless gas. Poisoning happens when hydrocarbons are burned in a closed space without proper ventilation. Common devices that cause carbon monoxide poisoning are generators, heating systems, charcoal grills, engine-driven tools, camp stoves and lanterns, gas ovens and ranges, and gas water heaters. Carbon monoxide poisoning makes children (and adults) dizzy, nauseated, and sleepy, after which they slip into a coma. Death may happen if carbon monoxide poisoning isn't treated in time. All devices producing carbon monoxide should be installed in the open, or in a well-ventilated place. Install carbon dioxide detectors in the home, and test them regularly. Never leave a car running in a garage attached to the house."", 'Plants That Are Poisonous to Kids Garden plants add beauty to your home and garden, but some are dangerous because they have toxins that can affect many parts of the body, including the stomach, heart, liver, and skin. They can make your child sick if eaten. Among them are daffodils, dumb cane, foxglove, hydrangea, lilies, oleanders, rhododendrons, and wisteria. Oleanders, for example, contain glycosides that damage the heart and can be fatal if consumed. You should know the name of each plant in your garden. Consider removing those known to be dangerous.', 'Hydrocarbon Poisoning Gasoline (petrol), kerosene, lamp oil, lighter fluid, motor oil, and paint thinners and removers are hydrocarbons. Exposure by ingestion or inhaling can affect the brain and respiratory and central nervous systems.', 'Liquid Nicotine Poisoning Used in e-cigarettes, liquid nicotine is a very concentrated and dangerous substance. Even a small amount consumed or spilled on the skin of a young child can cause death. Other harmful nicotine products include cigars, chewing tobacco, nicotine gum, cigarettes, and patches. They can be poisonous if taken in by your child.', ""Child Poisoning Treatment If a child has swallowed something extremely toxic and fast-acting, you may need to do first aid right away and call for emergency medical help. Then follow these steps: Swallowed poison. Take the substance from the child, and get them to spit out any in their mouth. Don't force them to vomit without medical advice. Touched poison. If poison touches the skin, immediately wash the area with soap and warm water for 10-30 minutes. If there is blistering, take the victim to the emergency room right away. Inhaled poison. Take your child out in the open air, away from the poisonous place. You may need to give cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) until help arrives."", ""Other treatments for poison exposure include: If a toxic substance gets in the eyes, flush eyes continuously with warm water for 10 minutes. If the victim has stopped breathing or doesn't have a heartbeat, perform CPR and call 911 right away. If the victim is unconscious or breathing is difficult or labored, call 911.

Safely throw away – into a sealed outdoor trash receptacle – all household products and medications that are old or aren't used regularly. Never mix products; dangerous fumes could result. Vitamins and supplements also should be out of reach of children. Be especially alert at Grandma's house. Older people with hand arthritis may get medication bottles that don't have child safety lids. They're also more likely to leave medicine out in the open. Keep indoor plants out of reach; some may be poisonous. Stay away from areas that have been sprayed recently with pesticides or fertilizer.""]"
67,What Is Primary Biliary Cholangitis?,"[""Primary biliary cholangitis is a disease that damages the bile ducts in your liver. Your doctor may also call it PBC. It used to be called primary biliary cirrhosis. These ducts have an important job. They carry a fluid called bile, which plays a key role in digestion, away from your liver. Bile is what helps your body absorb fats, cholesterol, and even some vitamins. It also helps get rid of worn-out red blood cells and other things your body doesn't need. When bile ducts don’t work the way they should, those substances stay in your liver. The bile backs up, and your liver gets inflamed and maybe even scarred. Over time, the scar tissue replaces healthy liver tissue, and the organ doesn’t work the way it should. This is usually a slow and gradual process. Your liver does OK for a while. And you’ll take medications to help it work better and manage your symptoms. But the disease can worsen over a few months or many years. One day, you may need a liver transplant ."", ""What Causes It? Doctors aren't totally sure. It isn’t passed down from parents to children, but there does seem to be a family link. It’s more common if you have a parent, brother, or sister who has it. Most people who get it are women, and most are in their 40s and 50s. The disease may be linked to immune system problems like thyroid trouble, pernicious anemia, or scleroderma . Things from outside your body -- smoking, chemicals, or infections -- can also trigger the disease."", 'What Are the Symptoms? Early on, you might not notice any at all. You can live for many years without problems. Later, you might feel tired or have itchy skin or dry eyes and mouth. As the disease gets worse, you might notice: Yellow skin and eyes ( jaundice ) Swollen feet and ankles Pain and swelling in your abdomen Bone, muscle, or joint pain Darkened skin', 'How Is It Diagnosed? If you have any of these symptoms, your doctor might suggest blood tests. They’ll tell them\xa0how well your liver works and if you have any immune system issues. They\xa0may also want you to have imaging tests like an ultrasound , CT scan , MRI, or endoscopy (ERCP). These provide a more detailed look at your liver and the area around it. They\xa0may also suggest a liver biopsy. They’ll remove a small piece of liver tissue and examine it in the lab to look for damage or disease.', ""How Is It Treated? There's no cure, but medications can slow down the disease. The most common drug is ursodiol (ursodeoxycholic acid), which helps move bile through your liver. Another drug, obeticholic acid ( Ocaliva ), can be used with ursodiol or alone to treat PBC. There are also newer drugs to treat symptoms like itching and fatigue. Your doctor may suggest you make some changes in your daily life. If you drink alcohol, stop. It puts a strain on your liver. Choose low-sodium foods and exercise regularly to ease your symptoms. When medications no longer help, a liver transplant may be an option.""]"
68,What Is Pudendal Neuralgia?,"['Pudendal neuralgia is a condition that causes pain, discomfort, or numbness in your pelvis or genitals. It happens when a major nerve in the lower body is damaged or irritated, and it can make it hard to use the bathroom, have sex, or sit down. The pain comes and goes. It’s not clear exactly how many people have this condition, but experts believe it’s rare. The pudendal nerve runs from the back of the pelvis to near the base of your penis or vagina, where it branches off into other nerves. It sends messages to the brain from your genitals, anus, and other nearby body parts. It controls the sphincter muscles that open and close when you use the bathroom.', 'Causes There are several things that can damage your pudendal nerve. It can happen when you’re injured, have surgery, or give birth. A tumor or an infection can squeeze or irritate it. And sometimes, certain types of exercise, like spending a lot of time on a bicycle, can cause the problem.', 'Symptoms You usually feel pudendal neuralgia symptoms in your lower body, genitals, or perineum (the area between your genitals and anus). These may include: A sharp or burning pain More sensitivity Numbness or a pins-and-needles feeling, like when your leg falls asleep A swollen feeling These feelings might be worse when you sit down. Or you may have symptoms on both sides of your body, and they might go into your belly, buttocks, or legs. You also may have problems such as: A sudden or frequent need to go to the bathroom Trouble or pain during sex For men, problems getting an erection', 'Diagnosis If you have pelvic pain, tell your doctor. At your appointment, you’ll answer questions about your symptoms and get a physical examination . Your doctor will put a finger into your vagina or rectum and put pressure on the nerve to check on it. You might also get an imaging test with an MRI machine. It uses powerful magnets and radio waves to take a picture of your body’s internal organs. Your doctor may also give you a pudendal nerve block . This is a shot you get in your pelvis to numb the nerve and see if your symptoms go away.', 'Treatment Most people with pudendal neuralgia get treatment with a combination of physical therapy, lifestyle changes, and medicines. Sit up straight or stand more often to help with nerve pain. This can take pressure off the pudendal nerve. Don’t do squats or cycle. Certain exercises can make pudendal neuralgia worse. Go for physical therapy. It relaxes and stretches the muscles at the lower end of your pelvis, known as the pelvic floor. This can ease pressure that may irritate the pudendal nerve. If pudendal neuralgia makes it hard to control your bladder or bowels, physical therapy can help with that, too. Try prescription medication . Muscle relaxants may help relieve symptoms of pudendal neuralgia. Drugs used to treat other conditions, like depression or epilepsy , might also help. If these don’t work, your doctor may give you a shot of medications that numb the nerve or lower inflammation, which lessens pressure. These may take several weeks to fully take effect. In rare cases, your doctor may recommend surgery to remove anything that presses on the nerve. You may also get a small electrical device put under your skin to stimulate the nerve and interrupt the pain signals it sends to the brain.']"
69,What Is a Pulmonary Embolism?,"['Your blood goes from your heart to your lungs through your pulmonary artery . In the lungs, the blood is supplied with oxygen, and then it goes back to the heart, which pumps the oxygen-rich blood to the rest of your body. When a blood clot gets caught in one of the arteries that go from the heart to the lungs, it’s called a pulmonary embolism (PE). The clot blocks the normal flow of blood. This blockage can cause serious problems, like damage to your lungs and low oxygen levels in your blood. The lack of oxygen can harm other organs in your body, too. If the clot is big or the artery is clogged by many smaller clots, a pulmonary embolism can be deadly. Pulmonary embolisms usually travel to the lungs from a deep vein in the legs. Doctors call this deep vein thrombosis (DVT). These clots develop when the blood can’t flow freely through the legs because your body is still for a long time, say during a long flight or drive. It might also happen if you’re on bed rest after surgery or illness.', 'What Else Could Raise My Chances of Having a PE? The risk factors are the same as those for DVT . Doctors refer to these as Virchow’s triad. They are: Not moving for a long time or having changes in normal blood flow. This often happens if you’ve been in the hospital or on bed rest for a long period of time. It could also happen during a long flight or vehicle ride. Blood that’s more likely to clot. Doctors call this hypercoagulability. It could be caused by medications , like birth control pills . Smoking , cancer , recent surgery, or pregnancy can also put you at risk. Damage to a blood vessel wall. Injury to your lower leg can lead to this. In rare cases, an artery in the lung can be blocked by something other than a clot, like an air bubble or part of a tumor. If you break a big bone , fat from the bone marrow can sometimes come through the blood and cause blockage.', 'How Can I Prevent a Pulmonary Embolism? The best way to prevent a PE is to try to stop blood clots from forming deep in your veins. This can be challenging if you’ve been on bed rest after a surgery or illness, or if you just took a long flight. If you’re at risk, here are a few things that may help lower your chances of getting these dangerous blood clots: Blood thinners Doctors call these anticoagulants . They keep your blood from forming clots. Your doctor may prescribe them to you while you’re in the hospital for surgery. They might also suggest that you keep taking them for some time after you go home. Your doctor might also recommend blood thinners if you’ve been hospitalized after a stroke or heart attack , or if you have complications from cancer. Compression stockings These are long socks that squeeze your legs. The extra pressure helps blood move through your veins and leg muscles. Your doctor may recommend that you wear them for a while after surgery.', 'Exercise Get out of bed and walk when you’re getting over a long stay in the hospital or an illness that’s kept you in bed for too long. It’ll keep the blood in your legs flowing so it doesn’t have a chance to pool. Stretching during trips If you’re on a long flight, try to walk around every few hours. If you can’t stand up, flex your ankles by pulling your toes toward you. Here’s another stretch you can try to do while seated: Pull your leg up toward your chest with one hand . Hold the bottom of that leg with the other hand. Keep this pose for 15 seconds, and then try it with the other leg. Do this up to 10 times per hour. If you’re driving a long distance, stop every hour and stretch your legs. Also, be sure to drink extra fluids to help you stay hydrated. Lifestyle changes', 'Other steps you can take include: Maintain a healthy weight . If you plan to take hormones, like birth control or replacement therapy, talk to your doctor about your risk for blood clots. If you have other health issues, like diabetes or heart failure , take your meds, watch what you eat, and talk to your doctor about any changes. Also talk to your doctor if you have a history of kidney disease or certain autoimmune diseases , or a family history of blood clots If you smoke, quit. In life-threatening cases of pulmonary embolism, your doctor may decide to give you drugs called thrombolytics to break up the clot. It may even need to be taken out or broken up with surgery, though this is rare.']"
70,LAM Lung Disease (Lymphangioleiomyomatosis),"[""LAM lung disease ( lymphangioleiomyomatosis ) is a rare lung disease that tends to affect women of childbearing age. In LAM lung disease, muscle cells that line the lungs ' airways and blood vessels begin to multiply abnormally. These muscle cells spread into areas of the lung where they don't belong. The air sacs in the lung also swell and form small pockets called cysts . As the cysts develop throughout the lungs, LAM causes breathing problems similar to emphysema . The muscle cells can spread outside the lung, forming noncancerous tumors on organs in the abdomen and pelvis."", ""What Causes LAM Lung Disease? No one knows what causes pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis. Estrogen seems to be involved, because women rarely develop LAM before puberty or after menopause . Fewer than 10 men are known to have ever developed LAM lung disease. Smoking isn't known to cause LAM: more than half of people with LAM lung disease have never smoked. LAM is so rare that it's unknown how often it really occurs. For example, during a three-year study by researchers, fewer than 250 people with LAM were identified in the U.S. Fewer than 2,000 women are known to have LAM today. LAM is not cancer , but appears similar to other conditions in which benign tumors grow uncontrollably. LAM lung disease shares some features with a different condition called tuberous sclerosis ."", ""Symptoms of LAM Lung Disease Most people with LAM lung disease experience shortness of breath. Other symptoms include wheezing and cough , which may be bloody. Often, people with LAM develop a sudden pneumothorax (collapsed lung). This occurs when one of the cysts near the lung's edge ruptures, allowing inhaled air to compress the lung. A pneumothorax usually causes pain and shortness of breath. If muscle cells migrate to areas outside the lungs, LAM can cause other symptoms: Chylous ascites: The flow of lymph is blocked by errant muscle cells. Chyle (milky lymph fluid) builds up in the belly. Angiomyolipomas: Noncancerous tumors may grow in the liver or kidneys . These can cause pain , bleeding, or kidney failure . In a few people with LAM, discovery of these benign tumors outside the lungs is the first sign of LAM lung disease."", ""Diagnosis of LAM Lung Disease Most people with LAM see their doctor because of shortness of breath. Because LAM is so rare, it's often misdiagnosed at first as asthma or emphysema ."", ""Generally, LAM is finally discovered after a long workup for shortness of breath. Tests frequently performed include: Chest X-ray : In LAM, a chest X-ray may show fine lines in the lungs, where muscle cells have multiplied. In the early stages of LAM lung disease, the chest X-ray film may look normal. Pulmonary function tests measure lung capacity and the ability to get oxygen from the air into the blood . These tests are usually abnormal in people with LAM. Computed tomography ( CT scan ): Chest CT scans are almost always abnormal in LAM lung disease. Cysts are usually visible. High-resolution CT (HRCT) may show the changes of LAM even more clearly. It's possible to diagnose LAM lung disease based on a woman's history and findings on high-resolution CT scan . But doctors often recommend collecting a sample of lung tissue ( biopsy ) to confirm the diagnosis. Lung biopsies can be collected in different ways: Bronchoscopy : An endoscope (flexible tube with a camera on its end) is passed into the windpipe and lower airways. Tools passed through the endoscope can collect a lung biopsy . Thoracoscopy : An endoscope is passed through a small incision into the chest to collect lung tissue. Open lung biopsy : Traditional surgery in which a surgeon works through a larger incision in the chest and takes a sample of lung tissue. A physician (pathologist) then examines lung biopsy tissue, helping make the diagnosis of LAM lung disease with greater certainty."", ""Treatment of LAM Lung Disease The drug sirolimus ( Rapamune ) is the first drug approved to treat lymphangioleiomyomatosis. The drug has been found to help improve the lung capacity in patients, allowing them to breathe easier. In addition, inhaled bronchodilators ( albuterol , ipratropium ) can help open the airways, reducing shortness of breath in some people. Patients with LAM lung disease should avoid smoking cigarettes as well as second hand smoke. Because hormones like estrogen seem to be involved in LAM lung disease, treatments that manipulate hormone levels could help some people with LAM. A number of hormone-related treatments have been tested in women with LAM lung disease: Progesterone Tamoxifen ( Nolvadex, Soltamox ) Synthetic luteinizing hormone -releasing hormones ( Leuprolide , Lupron ) In clinical trials that tested these therapies, some women were helped, but others were not. People who experience pneumothorax generally must undergo procedures to reinflate the collapsed lung and prevent its recurrence. If pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis progresses and becomes disabling, lung transplantation may be an option. Though it's a drastic treatment, most people undergoing lung transplants for LAM lung disease gain improved lung function and quality of life after surgery."", 'What to Expect With LAM Lung Disease Pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis is progressive, and so far there is no cure. Most women with LAM experience a steady decline in lung function, with increased shortness of breath over time. However, women vary widely in their experience of living with LAM lung disease. Some rapidly progress while others progress slowly: in some studies, nearly 90% of women were alive 10 years after diagnosis with LAM. However, surviving as long as 20 years after diagnosis is rare. Researchers are working to identify how muscle cells go awry in LAM. Clinical trials of experimental drugs to treat LAM lung disease are also under way.']"
71,Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS),"['What Is Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome? Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a condition that causes fluid to build up in your lungs so oxygen can’t get to your organs. Fluid leaks from small blood vessels and collects in tiny air sacs in your lungs so they can’t fill with enough air. Because of this, your blood can’t pick up the oxygen it needs to carry to the rest of your body. Organs such as your kidneys or brain might not work the way they should or might shut down. ARDS is sometimes life-threatening and can get worse quickly. But it’s generally treatable, and most people recover. Fast diagnosis and treatment are important.', 'ARDS Causes and Risk Factors ARDS is usually triggered by another health problem, so most people who have it are already in the hospital for something else. Causes of ARDS include: Sepsis . This is when you get an infection in your bloodstream and your immune system goes into overdrive, causing inflammation , small blood clots , and bleeding.', 'Accidents. Injuries from a car wreck or a fall can damage your lungs or the part of your brain that controls breathing . Breathing in harmful things. Dense smoke or chemical fumes can trigger ARDS. Other possible causes of ARDS include: Pneumonia Bleeding that makes you need a transfusion Inflamed pancreas Drug overdose Near- drowning Burns Reactions to medications Breathing food into your lungs ( aspiration ) Doctors don’t know why some people get ARDS and others don’t. Risk factors include: A problem in your genes Heavy alcohol use Smoking tobacco Using oxygen for a lung condition Recent high-risk surgery or chemotherapy Obesity', 'ARDS Symptoms ARDS puts a lot of strain on your lungs. Symptoms include: Shortness of breath Low blood pressure Unusually fast breathing Fast heartbeat Cough Fever Chest pain , especially when breathing deeply Confusion and exhaustion Blue-tinted lips or nails from lack of oxygen in your blood Dizziness', 'ARDS Diagnosis and Tests No single test can identify ARDS. It’s more of a puzzle that your doctor pieces together. They’ll want to rule out conditions that can have similar symptoms.', 'Your doctor will ask about your medical history, do a physical exam , and listen to your breathing and your heartbeat. They may also look for: Signs of extra fluid in your body Bluish color on your lips or skin Tests to help with diagnosis include: Imaging tests. A chest X-ray is crucial and probably the first test your doctor will order. You might also have a CT scan . These can give your doctor an idea of how much fluid is in your lungs and where it is. Blood tests. These check your oxygen level. They can also look for signs of infection or anemia , a lack of red blood cells. Heart tests . These can rule out conditions such as heart failure (when your heart doesn’t pump blood through your body the way it should).', 'ARDS Treatment Treatment aims to get the oxygen levels in your blood up to where they should be, so your organs get what they need. In some cases, your doctor might give you an air mask and later go to a breathing tube and ventilator (a machine that helps you breathe).', 'Your doctor will also treat other conditions that might be causing ARDS. Treatments include: Nutrition and medicine through fluids injected into your blood Medication to prevent bleeding and blood clots Medication to keep you calm and comfortable Most ARDS treatment is done in a hospital’s intensive care unit. Many people have a full recovery with no long-term problems.', 'ARDS Complications The condition or its treatment can lead to other problems, including: Collapse of part of your lung because it can’t inflate the way it should ( atelectasis ) or because of air between your lung and your chest wall (pneumothorax) Organ damage or failure Confusion High blood pressure in the artery that goes from your heart to your lungs ( pulmonary hypertension ) Scarred lung tissue (pulmonary fibrosis) Blood clots Infection', 'ARDS Outlook If you’ve recently had ARDS, improve your recovery by: Not smoking Not drinking alcohol Getting a flu shot every year and a pneumonia vaccine as directed by your doctor You might need to be on a ventilator for a while. ARDS can leave you weak, so you may go to physical therapy to get stronger. ARDS can be emotionally and physically tough on patients and families. A support group may help with anxiety , stress , or depression .']"
72,What Is Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis?,"['You may know that white blood cells are your body’s infection fighters. But if your body makes too much of a type of immune cell called histiocytes, they can cause tumors, lesions, and other tissue damage. One of these rare disorders -- which resembles some types of cancer -- is called Langerhans cell histiocytosis, or LCH. It most commonly appears in toddlers and very young children, but you can have it as an adult, too.', 'Symptoms LCH can show up on many places on your body, but most often on your skin and bones. It can affect any organ, including your lungs , liver , brain , spleen , or lymph nodes . In about 8 out of 10 people, LCH leads to tumors called granulomas in the skull and in other bones. That can cause pain and swelling, and sometimes it can fracture your arms or legs. LCH symptoms can range from mild to more serious. Some people are born with it, and the disease eventually goes away on its own. But others have a severe and long-lasting type that affects multiple parts of the body.', 'Along with your bones, it can affect your: Skin. Red, scaly bumps in skin folds are common. Infants with LCH can get red, scaly scalps, which is often mistaken for cradle cap , a common skin condition. Liver . Usually, only severe cases of LCH affect the liver. Your skin might appear jaundiced, or yellow, and your blood can take longer to clot. Lymph nodes. These glands, which are behind the ears , in the neck, and in other places, can swell up. You also might have trouble breathing or have coughs .', 'Diagnosis Your doctor will know if you have LCH after a tissue biopsy . That’s when a specialist called a pathologist views the sample under a microscope for specific proteins and other markers of the disease. In addition to the physical exam , your doctors may order other tests based on your symptoms: X-rays of your lungs and bones Bone marrow biopsy to look for signs of LCH Blood chemistry test to check your kidneys , liver , thyroid , and immune system MRIs and PET and CT scans to get detailed images of your body Urinalysis to check levels of red and white cells, protein, and sugar in your pee', 'Causes We don’t know all the reasons why some people get LCH. About half of the people with the disorder have a faulty gene that makes the Langerhans immune cells grow out of control. That genetic mutation happens after birth, which means you usually won’t get LCH from your parents. Researchers suspect that other things may also play a role: Smoking Parents who were exposed to environmental toxins, like benzene or wood dust Infections as a newborn Family history of thyroid disease', 'Treatments As with some types of cancer , doctors sometimes treat LCH with chemotherapy . Many people with the disorder get care from cancer specialists like oncologists and hematologists. But unlike most cancers, limited forms of LCH sometimes spontaneously go away on their own. Beside chemotherapy, options for treatment include: Low-dose radiation to targeted part of the body Surgery to remove LCH lesions Steroids like prednisone or anti-inflammatory drugs Ultraviolet light therapy for skin conditions Stem cell transplant Bone marrow, liver, or lung transplants in very serious cases A great majority of people with LCH recover with treatment. If the disease is in your spleen, liver, or bone marrow, it’s called a high-risk LCH. About 80% of people with that type survive.']"
73,Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura,"['Background Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), also known as primary immune thrombocytopenic purpura and autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura, is defined as isolated thrombocytopenia with normal bone marrow and in the absence of other causes of thrombocytopenia. ITP has two distinct clinical syndromes, manifesting as an acute condition in children and a chronic condition in adults.', 'Pathophysiology ITP is primarily a disease of increased peripheral platelet destruction, with most patients having antibodies to specific platelet membrane glycoproteins. Relative marrow failure may contribute to this condition, since studies show that most patients have either normal or diminished platelet production. Acute ITP often follows an acute infection and has a spontaneous resolution within 2 months. Chronic ITP persists longer than 6 months without a specific cause.', 'Epidemiology Frequency United States Incidence rates are as follows: The incidence of ITP in adults is approximately 66 cases per 1,000,000 per year. An average estimate of the incidence in children is 50 cases per 1,000,000 per year. New cases of chronic refractory ITP comprise approximately 10 cases per 1,000,000 per year.', 'International According to studies in Denmark and England, childhood ITP occurs in approximately 10-40 cases per 1,000,000 per year. A prospective, population-based study in Norway indicated an incidence of 53 per 1,000,000 in children younger than 15 years.\xa0A study in Kuwait reported a higher incidence of 125 cases per 1,000,000 per year. Mortality/Morbidity Hemorrhage represents the most serious complication; intracranial hemorrhage is the most significant. The mortality rate from hemorrhage is approximately 1% in children and 5% in adults. In patients with severe thrombocytopenia, predicted 5-year mortality rates from bleeding are significantly raised in patients older than age 60 and those under age 40 --\xa047.8% versus 2.2%, respectively. Older age and previous history of hemorrhage increase the risk of severe bleeding in adult ITP. Spontaneous remission occurs in more than 80% of cases in children. However, it is uncommon in adults. Age See the list below: Peak prevalence occurs in adults ages\xa020-50. Peak prevalence occurs in children ages\xa02-4. Approximately 40% of all patients are younger than age 10.', 'Sex- and Age-related Demographics In chronic ITP (adults), the female-to-male ratio is 2.6:1. More than 72% of patients older than age 10 are female. In acute ITP (children), distribution is equal between males (52%) and females (48%). In adults, the peak prevalence is from ages 20 to 50.\xa0In children, peak prevalence is from ages 2 to 4.\xa0Approximately 40% of all patients are younger than age 10.

74,Thrombocytopenia (Low Platelet Count),"['What Is Thrombocytopenia? Thrombocytopenia is the condition when you don’t have enough platelets in your blood. Platelets are small blood cells that clot your blood after you get any cut or scrape that bleeds or a bigger injury.These cells stick together, which stops bleeding. You need platelets for your blood to clot. When your platelet counts are low, you may be at risk for bleeding.(Photo credit: Skypixel/Dreamstime) If you\'re wondering what the long name means, here\'s how it breaks down: ""Thrombocytes"" is another name for your platelets, and ""penia"" means you don\'t have enough of something. Put those terms together, and you get ""thrombocytopenia."" A healthy person usually has a platelet count of 150,000 to 450,000 in every microliter of blood. (A single drop of blood has about 35 microliters.) You have low platelets and thrombocytopenia if your lab values fall under 150,000.', ""Thrombocytopenia Symptoms Usually, you won't feel anything when you have thrombocytopenia. The condition often has no symptoms. But when you do have symptoms, they can include: Bleeding. This happens most often from your gums or nose. Thrombocytopenia also can cause heavier or longer periods or breakthrough bleeding if you have a menstrual cycle. You may also see blood in your pee or poop. Blotches and bruises . You might have large areas of bleeding under the skin that don't turn white when you press on them. You also might see what looks like the bruises you get from a bump or after being hit. They could be blue or purple and change to yellow or green over time. These are caused from the inside by the sudden leaking from tiny blood vessels. The medical name for these is purpura. Red, flat spots on your skin. You'll see these spots the size of a pinhead mostly on your legs and feet, and they may appear in clumps. Your doctor may call them petechiae. Petechiae don't turn white when you put pressure on them. Fatigue. Low platelets by itself won't make you feel run down and tired. But other conditions that cause low platelets can leave you feeling fatigued. Enlarged spleen. You'll have this if your spleen is trapping platelets, which may be one reason for your low counts."", ""Thrombocytopenia Causes Thrombocytopenia has many possible causes. Sometimes it runs in families, but it's rare. Low platelet counts are more often related to one of many medical conditions or medicines you take for another condition. If your low platelet counts are caused by another condition, treating the underlying problem may help. In general, anything that makes your body make less platelets than it needs will cause low platelet counts. You also can have low counts if your body is breaking platelets down or using them up faster than it's making new ones. Your platelet counts also can be low if your spleen or another part of your body is trapping platelets more than it should. Conditions or things that can cause your body to make too few platelets include: Leukemia or other cancer types Certain anemias (when your blood doesn't have enough red blood cells) Viral infections, including hepatitis C or HIV Certain medicines or treatments, including chemotherapy or radiation Drinking too much alcohol Toxins, including pesticides or arsenic"", ""Conditions or things that can cause your body to break platelets down too fast include: Pregnancy Autoimmune diseases, including lupus or rheumatoid arthritis Bacterial or viral infections Medicines that make your immune system destroy platelets Certain rare conditions, including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura or hemolytic uremic syndrome Conditions or things that can cause too many of your platelets to get lost or trapped include: Alcohol abuse or alcohol use disorder Bleeding or hemorrhage Pregnancy Liver disease Blood clots in your lungs (pulmonary embolism) High blood pressure in your lungs (pulmonary hypertension) What are the most common low platelet count causes? The most common reason for low platelet counts is another health condition or a medicine you're taking for another health condition. Some other risk factors for low platelets include: Family history Genetics Age"", 'Types of Thrombocytopenia You can have different types of thrombocytopenia depending on what\'s causing your low platelet counts: Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) One of the most common causes of low platelets is a condition called immune thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP). You may hear it called by its old name, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. ""Purpura"" means that your skin looks purple like it\'s bruised. Although doctors don\'t know why ITP happens, the problem is that your immune system isn\'t working right. Your antibodies, which should attack infections, destroy your platelets by mistake.', ""ITP comes in two types: acute and chronic. Acute ITP usually happens in kids after a virus like chickenpox. It comes on fast and goes away in weeks or months. You probably won't need any treatment, and it usually won't come back. Chronic ITP means you'll have it for 6 months or more. Chronic ITP is more common in adults than it is in kids. But teens also can get it. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) TTP doesn't happen a lot, but it's dangerous when it does. When you have TTP, you'll get many blood clots throughout your body. These clots can make your organs not work right or damage them. The reason you'll have low platelet counts in your blood is that they're being used up in all the clots. TTP usually lasts for days, weeks, or even months. Without treatment, it can lead to brain damage, stroke, or death. Drug-induced thrombocytopenia (DIT) Medicines can cause low platelet count. This happens a lot, but doctors don't always realize a drug is why you have low platelet counts. More than 300 drugs can cause low platelets."", ""Usually you'll have this type of thrombocytopenia 1-2 weeks after you start a new drug. But certain drugs may cause it after you take it the first time. If a drug is causing your low platelet count, it usually will go away after you stop taking it. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) This type happens when you take a drug called heparin. Doctors use heparin to protect against blood clots when you're at risk for a dangerous clot due to surgery or another condition. It can happen when the drug makes your platelets clump up instead of staying in your blood. It usually happens 2-3 days after you take heparin the first time. Sometimes your immune system also plays a role. HIT is the most common type of DIT. It happens most often when you're in the hospital. Gestational thrombocytopenia This type is the most common cause of low platelets when you're pregnant. It's not clear why pregnancy causes low platelet counts. It happens most often late in pregnancy. It usually goes away after birth. But if you've had gestational thrombocytopenia with one pregnancy, it may come back if you get pregnant again."", ""Usually this type of thrombocytopenia doesn't lead to bleeding. But your doctor may want to order tests to make sure there isn't some other reason for your low platelet counts. Dilutional thrombocytopenia You can have low platelets after a major blood transfusion to replace more than all the blood you have in 24 hours. It happens when you've lost blood and platelets and then your blood is replaced with lots of red cells. If you have this, a doctor will decide if you need more platelets to get your count back up. Distributional thrombocytopenia This is the name for low platelet counts when your platelets get trapped in your spleen. Your spleen usually will have about 30% of your platelets in it. When your spleen is bigger than it should be, it can have up to 90% of your platelets. Pseudothrombocytopenia This type isn't thrombocytopenia at all. It happens when a problem with a blood test makes it look like your platelets are low when they really aren't. It usually isn't a problem, but it could be if you get more testing or treatment you don't need."", 'Thrombocytopenia Diagnosis Thrombocytopenia is often found by chance when your doctor does a routine blood test. They might ask you questions to find out why your platelet counts are low and what type of thrombocytopenia you have. Some questions your doctor may ask include: What symptoms (including bleeding) have you noticed? When did you first see them? Does anything make them better? Or worse? What medications and supplements are you taking? Have you had any shots in the last month, a blood transfusion, or used drugs with a needle? Does anyone in your family have a problem with their immune system, bleeding, or bruising? What have you eaten recently? Some tests check for low platelet counts or other things that may lead to low platelets: Blood test. A complete blood count (CBC) looks at the amount of red and white blood cells and platelets in your blood. Blood smear . This shows how your platelets look under a microscope. Bone marrow test . Your bone marrow is where new blood cells get made. Your doctor uses a very fine needle to draw a small amount of liquid bone marrow and check it for cells that may not be working right. Or you may get a biopsy, using a different kind of needle, so your doctor can check the types and numbers of cells in the bone marrow. Blood clot test. This test measures how long it takes your blood to clot. It tells you how your platelets are working. Platelet antibody test. This test will see if antibodies in your blood are attacking your platelets. If you have platelet antibodies in your blood, it means your low platelets are caused by ITP. Your doctor may do a physical exam to check you for signs of internal bleeding and feel if your spleen seems big. They may order an abdominal ultrasound to look for changes in your liver, spleen, or lymph nodes. You may also need genetic or other tests to help your doctor figure out why your platelets are low.', ""How Serious Is Thrombocytopenia? For most people, having a low platelet count isn't a big problem. But if you have a severe form, you can bleed even when you aren't hurt in your eyes, gums, or bladder. You also could bleed too much when you’re hurt. You could bleed even with no injury at all.Trombocytopenia can be fatal, especially if you bleed a lot or bleed in your brain. Thrombocytopenia Complications Life-threatening hemorrhage or internal bleeding. You'll get this when you have a platelet lab value under 20,000. When your platelets are this low, it can cause sudden bleeds, including brain hemorrhage, even when you don't have an injury. Strokes. If your blood clots too much despite your low platelets, you may have a stroke. Heart attack. You can have a heart attack if low platelets causes less blood to flow to your heart. If you have low platelets and don't follow your doctors advice, the condition can be life-threatening."", ""Questions for Your Doctor What's causing the problem? Do I need treatment? What are my treatment options? Which do you recommend? Do these treatments have side effects? What can I do about them? How will we know if the treatment is working? When will I start to feel better? What do you expect in my case? Does this condition put me at risk for other health problems? Do I need to see a specialist? How will I be monitored? How do I know if my platelets drop at home or I'm bleeding internally?"", ""Thrombocytopenia Treatment There are many treatment options for thrombocytopenia. If it's mild, you might not need any treatment. You'll need to work with your doctor to weigh the pros and cons of each and find a therapy that's right for you. The treatment will depend on what type of thrombocytopenia you have and what's causing it. If your thrombocytopenia is drug-induced, stopping your medicine may help. If you have ITP and the trouble is with your immune system, your treatment depends on how severe a case you have. If it's mild, you may only need to get regular checks of your platelet levels."", ""When you do need treatment, the goal is to get your platelet count up enough to prevent serious bleeding in your gut or brain. You may need a platelet transfusion if there is immediate life-threatening bleeding. You may only get treatment when you have symptoms. But it's possible your doctor could suggest treatment even when you feel fine. That's more likely if you're at high risk for bleeding or other complications. Some treatment options for low platelets include: Blood or platelet transfusions. Your doctor can give you more blood or platelets to replace those you've lost. Medicines. You may need medication for thrombocytopenia if the problem is with your immune system. Steroids or other medicines that target your immune system may help to keep your antibodies from attacking your platelets. Surgery. If other options don't work, your doctor might suggest surgery to take out your spleen (splenectomy). Plasma exchange. If your low platelet counts are from TTP, plasma exchange can filter out the abnormal parts of your blood to help keep you from getting clots."", ""Taking Care of Yourself You can still do most things, but you may need to make some changes to your lifestyle to avoid getting hurt or cut. These include: Avoid activities that make injury likely. Ask your doctor about steps you should take. For instance, it may be best for you to avoid contact sports such as boxing, martial arts, or football. Be thoughtful about which medicines you take. You probably shouldn't take medicines that make bleeding easier, such as aspirin and ibuprofen , or other NSAIDS like naproxen or Aleve . Don't drink too much alcohol. Check with your doctor to see how much it's OK to drink. It's always better to drink in moderation. Alcohol can make your body produce platelets more slowly."", ""What to Expect Your case may be different from someone else's. Your doctor will watch you to see how you're doing. If your thrombocytopenia is mild, you may not need any treatment. But even people who do need treatment can lead full lives. Find out as much as you can about your condition and its causes so you can best manage it."", 'Getting Support The Platelet Disorder Support Association has information about immune thrombocytopenia and other platelet disorders. They can help you connect to doctors, support groups, and other resources.', ""Takeaways If you have thrombocytopenia, it means your platelets are lower than they should be. Low platelet counts can happen for many reasons, and your treatment will depend on what's causing your condition and how severe it is. Most people with thrombocytopenia won't have any symptoms or serious health risks. See your doctor or a blood disorder specialist (hematologist) to find out what's causing your low platelet counts and what steps you can take to protect your health."", ""FAQs What is thrombocytopenia caused by? Anything that leads you to have fewer platelets than you need can cause thrombocytopenia. Your immune system can cause it by attacking platelets. It's also caused a lot by medicines you're taking. What is a major symptom of thrombocytopenia? Most people with low platelet counts won't feel any different. But when your platelets are too low, you may bleed more than you should when you cut yourself. If you have a more severe case, ask your doctor what symptoms you should watch for. What happens if you have thrombocytopenia? Most people with low platelet counts will be OK even without treatment. Your thrombocytopenia may go away by itself, depending on what's causing it. Ask your doctor what tests you should get to see how severe your condition is, what's causing it, and whether treatment is needed.""]"
75,Septic Arthritis,"[""Septic arthritis is also known as infectious arthritis , and is usually caused by bacteria. It can also be caused by a virus\xa0or fungus. The condition is an inflammation of a joint that's caused by infection. Typically, septic arthritis affects one large joint in the body, such as the knee or hip. Less frequently, septic arthritis can affect multiple joints."", 'What Causes Septic Arthritis? Septic arthritis usually is caused by bacteria that spread through the blood stream from another area of the body. It can also be caused by a bacterial infection from an open wound or an opening from a surgical procedure, such as knee surgery. In adults and children, common bacteria that cause acute septic arthritis include staphylococcus\xa0and streptococcus. Among young, sexually active adults, neisseria gonorrhoeae is the most common pathogen for the condition. These\xa0foreign invaders enter the bloodstream and infect the joint, causing inflammation and pain. Other infections, such as those caused by viruses and fungi, can also cause arthritis. Viruses include: Hepatitis A, B, and C Parvovirus B19 HIV (AIDS virus) HTLV-1 Adenovirus Coxsackie viruses Mumps Alphaviruses Flaviviruses Fungi that can cause arthritis include histoplasma, coccidioides, and blastomyces. These infections are usually slower to develop than bacterial infections .', ""Who's at Risk for Septic Arthritis? Young children and elderly adults are most likely to develop septic arthritis. People with open wounds are also at a higher risk for septic arthritis. In addition, people with a weakened immune system and those with pre-existing conditions such as cancer , diabetes, intravenous drug abuse, and immune deficiency disorders have a higher risk of septic arthritis. In addition, previously damaged joints have an increased likelihood of becoming infected."", 'What Are the Symptoms of Septic Arthritis? Symptoms of septic arthritis usually come on rapidly with intense pain, joint swelling , and fever. Septic arthritis symptoms may include: Chills Fatigue and generalized weakness Fever Inability to move the limb with the infected joint Severe pain in the affected joint, especially with movement Swelling (increased fluid within the joint) Warmth (the joint is red and warm to touch because of increased blood flow)', 'How Is Septic Arthritis Diagnosed? A procedure called arthrocentesis is commonly used to make an accurate diagnosis of septic arthritis. This procedure involves a surgical puncture of the joint to draw a sample of the joint fluid, known as synovial fluid. Normally, this fluid is sterile and acts as a lubricant.', 'During arthrocentesis, a needle is inserted into the affected joint to collect fluid from the joint. The fluid sample is sent to a lab for evaluation. The lab will perform a white cell count on the fluid, which will usually be very high. The lab will also try to culture bacteria or other organisms. This will help the doctor determine if an infection is present and which organism is causing it. X-rays are typically done to look for joint damage . Blood tests can also be used to monitor inflammation. MRI scanning is sensitive in evaluating joint destruction but is less useful in the early stages. Blood tests can also be taken to detect and monitor inflammation.', ""What's the Treatment for Septic Arthritis? Septic arthritis treatments include using a combination of powerful antibiotics as well as draining the infected synovial fluid from the joint. It's likely that antibiotics will be administered immediately to avoid the spread of the infection. Intravenous (IV) antibiotics are given, usually requiring admission to the hospital for initial treatment. The treatment, however, may be continued on an outpatient basis at home with the assistance of a home health nursing service. Initially, empiric antibiotics are chosen to cover a wide range of infections. If the bacteria can be identified, antibiotics specific to that organism are used. It may take four to six weeks of treatment with antibiotics to ensure complete eradication of the infectious agents."", 'Is the Infected Fluid Drained? Drainage of the infected area is critical for rapid clearing of the infection. Drainage is performed by removing the fluid with a needle and syringe. Often the draining occurs daily or with multiple surgical procedures. The exact method depends on the location of the joint. Using arthroscopy , your doctor can irrigate the joint and remove the infected tissue. If drainage cannot be accomplished with joint aspirations or arthroscopy, open joint surgery is often necessary to drain the joint. If the fluid buildup is significant, the drains are left in place to remove excess fluid that may build up after the surgery.']"
76,What Is Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD)?,"['Peripheral artery disease , sometimes called peripheral arterial disease or PAD, is a condition in which your arteries are narrowed and can’t carry as much blood to the outer parts of your body, like your arms and legs. It’s a form of peripheral vascular disease . Cramps that start when you’re moving and go away with rest are one of the warning signs of PAD. You will usually feel it in your legs, but it can be in other parts of your body, too. You can get PAD in your arms, head, stomach, and kidneys. You may also hear PAD called: Hardening of the arteries Peripheral arterial disease Peripheral vascular disease Poor circulation If you don’t get treatment, you could be more likely to have a heart attack or stroke . It can also lead to you needing to have a limb removed ( amputation ).', 'What Causes PAD? The most common cause of PAD is a blockage in the arteries, the vessels that carry blood away from the heart . This condition is called atherosclerosis . It happens when things in your bloodstream like fat and cholesterol form plaques that build up in your arteries.', 'Plaques are made up mostly of fat and are waxy at first. They collect slowly, so you don’t even know they’re there. Over time, plaque buildup makes your arteries harder and narrower. It’s a lot like old plumbing in a house. When there’s gunk in the pipes, water drains slowly, and the pipes start to clog. With plaque in your arteries, your blood flow slows, and your body doesn’t get the oxygen it needs. Doctors don’t know exactly why plaque builds up in the first place. They think it’s a slow-growing disease that could have its start in childhood. What are some less common PAD causes? If you don’t have atherosclerosis, your doctor may start to look for: Infection or inflammation of a blood vessel Injury to your arms or legs Irregular shape of your muscles or ligaments (the tissue that connects your bones or joints together) Exposure to radiation', 'What Are the Risk Factors for PAD? If you have heart disease , you have a 1-in-3 chance of having PAD. Other things that raise your chance of having PAD include: Age (older than 50) Diabetes High cholesterol High blood pressure Obesity Not being active Smoking', 'How Does Smoking Affect PAD? Smoking is the single biggest PAD risk factor that is in your control. It raises your risk for PAD by 400% compared with nonsmokers. And in people who get PAD, smokers tend to get symptoms 10 years earlier than nonsmokers. In addition, smokers with PAD do less well after certain types of heart bypass surgery, are twice as likely to require limb amputation and die more often of stroke or heart attack. Talk to your doctor about medications and therapies that can help you quit smoking.', 'What Are the Symptoms of PAD? You may have muscle pain or cramping because there’s less blood flow to your legs. This type of pain is called claudication. You usually feel it when you walk or climb stairs, but it stops when you rest.', 'It can affect different muscle groups, including: Buttock and hip Calf (most common) Foot (less common) Thigh What about symptoms in advanced PAD? Some people have a sense of burning or numbness. If you have an advanced form of PAD, your toes or feet might hurt even while you’re resting. Other signs and symptoms might\xa0include: Changes in the color of your legs Erectile dysfunction , most often in men with diabetes Leg weakness Fatigue while walking, especially in legs Legs that are cooler than your arms One leg that feels colder than the other Loss of hair on your legs Fainter pulse in your feet Shiny skin on your legs Skin that looks pale or kind of blue Slow toenail growth Wounds or sores on your toes or feet that don’t heal well If you have PAD in your arms, you’ll have similar symptoms to the ones in your legs. You may feel pain, cramps, or heaviness during activities, but it goes away when you rest.', 'You may notice that your hands are cold or numb and that your fingers look blue or pale. And you may also have sores on your arms and hands that don’t seem to heal. You can also have severe blockages with no pain at all. This usually is because your body grows blood vessels around the blockages. When should you talk to your doctor? If you have leg pain when you walk or any other PAD symptoms, talk to your doctor about it. Smoking is the main cause of this condition, but age and diabetes also play a role. Even if you don’t have symptoms, ask your doctor about PAD if you’re 70 or older. You should also ask about it if you’re 50 or older and you have diabetes or have ever been a smoker. If you have diabetes before age 50, talk to your doctor about PAD if any of the following are also true: You have a family history of PAD, heart attack, or stroke You have high blood pressure You have high cholesterol You smoke now or you have in the past You’re African American You’re very overweight', 'How Do Doctors Diagnose PAD? Your doctor will start with a physical exam to look for signs of PAD. They might check blood flow in your legs and feet and listen for a whooshing sound in your leg arteries. You might get other tests, including: Angiogram , in which your doctor uses a needle to put dye into your bloodstream before taking an X-ray to find blocked arteries Ankle-brachial index , which compares blood pressure in your lower leg and your upper arm Blood tests to check for risk factors like diabetes or high cholesterol Ultrasound to check blood flow and find blocked arteries If you have PAD, your doctor can tell you about the best treatment for you. It could mean changes to your lifestyle, new medicine, or for more advanced cases, surgery.', 'How Do Doctors Treat PAD? There are some simple things your doctor might recommend to help manage your symptoms and keep your PAD from getting worse. These include: Control your cholesterol and blood pressure Control blood sugar levels , especially with diabetes Eat a healthy diet Exercise Don’t smoke You also might need medical treatments including: Angioplasty . This procedure uses a catheter, a thin tube, to put a tiny balloon into your artery. When it’s inflated, the balloon pushes plaque out to widen the artery and restore blood flow. Your doctor might also put a mesh tube called a stent into your artery to keep it open. Medications . The drug cilostazol eases symptoms in many people. Pentoxifylline is another medication that can help with poor circulation. Doctors may also prescribe aspirin or other anti-clotting drugs. You also might take medicines to lower your cholesterol, blood pressure, or blood sugar . Surgery. If needed, your doctor can route your blood flow around a blocked artery with a procedure called a bypass graft.', 'Can PAD Lead to Other Problems? PAD can be a warning sign because if you have plaque in your legs, you probably have it in other places, too. You may have build-up in the arteries of your heart. This is called coronary artery disease. You may also have it in the ones that go to your kidneys. This is known as renal artery disease. This can also happen in the carotid arteries, which carry blood to the brain, leading to a stroke. If you have PAD and diabetes, you have a higher chance of getting what’s called critical limb ischemia. This starts with a sore or infection, usually in your foot or leg. But it doesn’t heal or go away. In some cases, you may need to have your foot or part of your leg removed.', 'What Could Help Prevent PAD? Healthy lifestyle choices are the first step to helping to prevent PAD. The single biggest effect you can have is to stop smoking. Or don’t start. That means: Regular exercise: Shoot for 30 minutes on most days of the week to start. Check with your doctor first if it’s been a while since you exercised. Healthy eating: Try proven approaches like the DASH diet or ask your doctor about the best diet for you. Stress control: Careful planning of your day can help keep stress down. Meditation, yoga, and regular downtime can help you unwind. Manage conditions: Treat or help prevent conditions that raise your PAD risk like high blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol. Remember that it’s often hard to detect symptoms of PAD, especially in the initial stages. Regular checkups can help with early diagnosis and treatment that can keep the worst symptoms and complications of PAD at bay.']"
