0,Fabry Disease,"What Is Fabry Disease? Fabry disease runs in families. It can have lots of different symptoms, including pain in the hands and feet and a specific kind of rash. When you have Fabry disease, a certain type of fatty substance builds up in the cells of your body. It narrows your blood vessels, which can hurt your skin, kidneys, heart, brain, and nervous system. Your doctor may call Fabry disease a ""storage disorder."" It usually starts in childhood and is much more common in men than women. Fabry disease is seen in all ethnic, racial, and demographic groups. There are treatments that can make a difference in how you feel, day to day. Getting support from your family and friends is key, too. Causes You get Fabry disease from your parents. It's passed down through genes. The problem is that your body can't make an enzyme called alpha-galactosidase A, which you need to break down fatty substances like oils, waxes, and fatty acids. When you have Fabry disease, you either were born without that enzyme or it doesn’t work right. Symptoms You may notice things like: Pain and burning in your hands and feet that get worse with exercise, fever, hot weather, or when you’re tired Small, dark red spots usually found between your bellybutton and knees Cloudy vision Hearing loss Ringing in the ears Sweating less than normal Stomach pain, bowel movements right after eating Fabry disease can lead to more serious problems, especially in men. Yet females that have the gene for Fabry,  or carriers of the gene, can also have symptoms of Fabry that show up differently. Women with the disease have a significant risk of serious complications from Fabry, as well as organ damage, and should be seen regularly by their doctor or health care provider Problems can include: Higher chance of a heart attack or stroke Serious kidney problems, including kidney failure High blood pressure Heart failure Enlarged heart Osteoporosis Getting a Diagnosis It can take a long time to get diagnosed with Fabry disease. That's because the symptoms of Fabry are common to many illnesses and can affect so many different parts of the body. Many people who have Fabry disease don't get diagnosed until years after they first have symptoms. They’ve often seen several different doctors for various symptoms and sometimes get the wrong diagnosis. If your family history suggests you could be at risk for Fabry disease, you may want to ask your doctor about getting genetic testing. When you see the doctor, they’ll do a physical exam and ask you questions like: How are you feeling? What's concerning you? What symptoms have you noticed? When did those symptoms start? What medical conditions run in your family? Have you seen other doctors about this problem? What did they tell you? If your doctor thinks it might be Fabry disease, they’ll ask you to either take a blood test so they can measure the level of alpha-galactosidase A, or take a DNA test. Questions for Your Doctor When the doctor says you have Fabry disease, it may be the first time you've heard of it. You probably have a lot of questions, especially if you've been trying to figure out what's causing your symptoms for a long time. You may want to start by asking your doctor questions like these: How did you diagnose Fabry disease? How has it affected my body? How many people with Fabry disease have you treated? Are there other doctors you would recommend that I see? What treatment do you recommend? How will we know if the treatment is working? What are the side effects? Do other people in my family need to get genetic testing to see if they have it? Are my children likely to get Fabry disease? Treatment There are two drug treatments. The most common is enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). These are given as infusions and replaces the enzyme that’s missing or isn’t working correctly. This allows your body to break down fatty acid substances the way it should. It’ll also help ease the pain and other symptoms that Fabry disease causes. You will probably visit an outpatient center every few weeks to get the enzyme injected into a vein. A newer option is the oral medication migalastat (Galafold). It differs from ERT in that it works to stabilize the enzymes that aren’t working. This also helps ease the effects of the disease on your organs. Because this disease affects the entire body and can damage many organs, your doctor may also recommend: Drugs to relieve pain (prescription or nonprescription), often time due to nerve damage Medicine for stomach problems, such as gastroparesis Blood thinners or other drugs for an irregular heartbeat or other heart problems Blood pressure medicine, which also helps protect your kidneys You may need dialysis or a kidney transplant if Fabry disease has caused serious kidney damage. You can also expect to get regular tests to keep track of how you're doing. These may include: Blood, urine, and thyroid tests EKG (electrocardiogram). A nurse or other medical professional will attach soft, sticky patches to different parts of your body. These patches measure electrical signals from your heart and can tell how fast your heart is beating and if it has a healthy rhythm. Echocardiogram. This is an ultrasound of your heart. It can show if all the parts of your heart are healthy and if it’s pumping well. Brain MRI. An MRI, or magnetic resonance imaging, makes pictures of organs and structures inside your body. CT of your head. CT, or computed tomography, is a powerful X-ray that makes detailed pictures of the inside of your body. Hearing and eye exams Lung function test to see how much air you breathe in and out, and how much oxygen is getting to your blood Taking Care of Yourself Be good to yourself. Do things that you enjoy, spend time with people who are good company, and save your energy for the things that really matter to you. Part of that may involve saying ""no"" more often, and letting people know what would help you. Your family and friends may not know much about Fabry disease. Help them understand what's going on with you. Sometimes, when people have serious health conditions, they get depressed or anxious because the condition is a lot to handle. Your doctor should check on how you're feeling, but you may want to bring it up and ask for a referral to a counselor. Talking to someone can help. What to Expect Although there’s no cure for Fabry disease, treatment can bring your symptoms under control. Even though you may not feel sick or seem to be having any problems, it's important that you follow up with treatments and tests as your doctor suggests. Getting Support You can find others living with Fabry disease and their caregivers through the Fabry Support & Information Group."
1,Muscular Dystrophy,"What Is Muscular Dystrophy? Muscular dystrophy (MD) is a group of inherited diseases in which the muscles that control movement (called voluntary muscles) progressively weaken. In some forms of this disease, the heart and other organs are also affected. There are nine major forms of muscular dystrophy: Myotonic Duchenne Becker Limb-girdle Facioscapulohumeral Congenital Oculopharyngeal Distal Emery-Dreifuss Muscular dystrophy can appear in infancy up to middle age or later, and its form and severity are determined in part by the age at which it occurs. Some types of muscular dystrophy typicallyaffect only males; some people with MD enjoy a normal life span with mild symptoms that progress very slowly; others experience swift and severe muscle weakness and wasting, dying in their late teens to early 20s. The various types of MD affect more than 50,000 Americans. Through advances in medical care, children with muscular dystrophy are living longer than ever before. Muscular Dystrophy Symptoms by Type Myotonic (also called MMD or Steinert's disease). The most common form of muscular dystrophy in adults, myotonic muscular dystrophy affects both men and women, and it usually appears any time from early childhood to adulthood. In rare cases, it appears in newborns (congenital MMD). The name refers to a symptom, myotonia -- prolonged spasm or stiffening of muscles after use. This symptom is usually worse in cold temperatures. The disease causes muscle weakness and also affects the central nervous system , heart , gastrointestinal tract, eyes , and hormone-producing glands. In most cases, daily living isn't restricted for many years. Those with myotonic MD have a decreased life expectancy. Duchenne. The most common form of muscular dystrophy in children, Duchenne muscular dystrophy typically affects only males. It appears between the ages of 2 and 6. The muscles decrease in size and grow weaker over time yet may appear larger. Disease progression varies, but many people with Duchenne (1 in 3,500 boys) need a wheelchair by the age of 12. In most cases, the arms, legs, and spine become progressively deformed, and there may be some cognitive impairment. Severe breathing and heart problems mark the later stages of the disease. Those with Duchenne MD usually die in their late teens or early 20s. Becker. This form is similar to Duchenne muscular dystrophy, but the disease is much milder: symptoms appear later and progress more slowly. It usually appears between the ages of 2 and 16 but can appear as late as age 25. Like Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Becker muscular dystrophy typically affects only males (1 in 30,000) and causes heart problems. Disease severity varies. Those with Becker can usually walk into their 30s and live further into adulthood. Limb-girdle. This appears in the teens to early adulthood and affects males and females. In its most common form, Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy causes progressive weakness that begins in the hips and moves to the shoulders, arms, and legs and the heart may be affected. Within 20 years, walking becomes difficult or impossible. Sufferers typically live to middle age to late adulthood. Facioscapulohumeral. Facioscapulohumeral refers to the muscles that move the face, shoulder blade, and upper arm bone . This form of muscular dystrophy appears in the teens to early adulthood and affects males and females. It progresses slowly, with short periods of rapid muscle deterioration and weakness. Severity ranges from very mild to completely disabling. Walking, chewing, swallowing, and speaking problems can occur. About 50% of those with facioscapulohumeral MD can walk throughout their lives, and most live a normal life span. It may also bee associated with seizures, mental health problems, and can involve the heart Congenital. Congenital means present at birth. Congenital muscular dystrophies progress slowly and affect males and females. The two forms that have been identified -- Fukuyama and congenital muscular dystrophy with myosin deficiency -- cause muscle weakness at birth or in the first few months of life, along with severe and early contractures (shortening or shrinking of muscles that causes joint problems). Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy causes abnormalities in the brain and often seizures . Oculopharyngeal. Oculopharyngeal means eye and throat. This form of muscular dystrophy appears in men and women in their 40s, 50s, and 60s. It progresses slowly, causing weakness in the eye and face muscles, which may lead to difficulty swallowing. Weakness in pelvic and shoulder muscles may occur later. Choking and recurrent pneumonia may occur. Distal. This group of rare diseases affects adult men and women. It causes weakness and wasting of the distal muscles (those farthest from the center) of the forearms, hands, lower legs, and feet . It is generally less severe, progresses more slowly, and affects fewer muscles than other forms of muscular dystrophy. Emery-Dreifuss. This rare form of muscular dystrophy appears from childhood to the early teens and affects mainly males. In very rare cases, females can be affected. For that to happen, both of a girls X chromosomes (the one they get from their mother and the one from their father) would have to have the defective gene. It causes muscle weakness and wasting in the shoulders, upper arms, and lower legs. Life-threatening heart problems are common and can also affect carriers -- those who have the genetic information for the disease but do not develop the full-blown version (including mothers and sisters of those with Emery-Dreifuss MD). Muscle shortening (contractures) occurs early in the disease. Weakness can spread to chest and pelvic muscles. The disease progresses slowly and causes less severe muscle weakness than some other forms of muscular dystrophy. Muscular Dystrophy Causes and Risk Factors Muscular dystrophy is caused by defects in certain genes, with type determined by the abnormal gene. In 1986, researchers discovered the gene that, when defective or flawed, causes Duchenne muscular dystrophy. In 1987, the muscle protein associated with this gene was named dystrophin. Duchenne muscular dystrophy occurs when that gene fails to make dystrophin. Becker muscular dystrophy occurs when a different mutation in the same gene results in some dystrophin, but it's either not enough or it's poor in quality. Scientists have discovered and continue to search for the genetic defects that cause other forms of muscular dystrophy. Most of the muscular dystrophies are a form of inherited disease called X-linked disorders or genetic diseases that mothers can transmit to their sons even though the mothers themselves are unaffected by the disease. Men carry one X chromosome and one Y chromosome. Females carry two X chromosomes. Thus, in order for a girl to become affected by muscular dystrophy, both their X chromosomes would have to carry the defective gene -- an extremely rare occurrence, since their mother would have to be a carrier (one defective X chromosome) and their father would have to have muscular dystrophy (since men carry just one X chromosome, the other is a Y chromosome). A female who carries the defective X chromosome can pass the disease to their son (whose other chromosome is a Y, from the father). A few muscular dystrophies aren't inherited at all and occur because of a new gene abnormality or mutation. Muscular Dystrophy Diagnosis To start, your doctor will examine your child and ask questions about medical and family health history. Muscular dystrophy is diagnosed using several different tests. These may include: Muscle biopsy . A small piece of muscle tissue is removed and examined to confirm the diagnosis or rule out another muscle disease. Genetic ( DNA ) testing. Genes passed down through families can cause some forms of muscular dystrophy. A blood test can determine if you or your child has the gene. Neurological tests. Various tests are done to check nervous system function, reflexes, and coordination. One example is a nerve conduction study, also called a nerve function test, or electromyography (EMG). Enzyme tests. These are blood tests that check for proteins, or enzymes, linked to muscle weakness. People with muscular dystrophy have high levels of the enzyme creatine kinase. It’s made when muscles are damaged. They also have higher levels of serum aldolase, which is made when your body breaks down sugar into energy. Heart monitoring. An electrocardiogram may be done to check for an abnormal heartbeat . Some types of muscular dystrophy cause irregular heartbeats. MRI or ultrasound . These imaging tests give the doctor a look at muscle quality and can reveal if fat is replacing muscle tissue. Muscular Dystrophy Treatment There is no cure for muscular dystrophy, but treatments can help manage symptoms and improve quality of life. Medications Prescription drugs are available to control muscular dystrophy symptoms or slow their progression. Medications for muscular dystrophy include: Steroids . Corticosteroids, such as prednisone and deflazacort (Emflaza), are the standard of care for muscular dystrophy. They help improve muscle strength and breathing and decrease weakness. Side effects include high blood pressure and weight gain . People who use steroids for a long time are at risk for brittle bones. Medicines targeting gene mutations. Eteplirsen (Exondys 51) and golodirsen (Vyondys 53) increase the level of the gene dystrophin. They’re approved to specifically treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Anticonvulsants. Often used to treat epilepsy , these antiseizure drugs may also help reduce muscle spasms . Immunosuppressants. These powerful medicines are often used to treat lupus and other autoimmune diseases . When given to people with muscular dystrophy, they may help prevent some muscle cell damage. Antibiotics. The doctor may prescribe an antibiotic to treat a lung infection, which is common in people with muscular dystrophy. Physical therapy Physical therapy helps keep joints and muscles flexible. It’s an important part of a muscular dystrophy treatment plan. The goal of physical therapy is to improve strength in the large muscle groups and prevent scoliosis and contractures. Physical therapy for muscular dystrophy may involve: Range of motion exercises Stretching Low-impact workouts, such as swimming or water exercise (aquatic therapy) Respiratory care Muscle weakness can affect the lungs, making breathing difficult. A respiratory therapist can teach you and your child how to properly use a mask, nose device, or mouthpiece. Mobility and positioning aids Braces, walkers, or wheelchairs help provide mobility and independence to people with muscular dystrophy. Standing with a walker, even for just a little bit each day, boosts blood flow and helps build better bones. Speech therapy Muscle weakness in the face and throat can make speaking difficult. Learning how to properly pace breathing and talking can be helpful. A speech therapist can also show you how to use speech communication devices. Surgery Surgery may be recommended to manage or correct complications of muscular dystrophy. For example, cataract surgery may be done to replace a cloudy eye lens. Or a person with muscular dystrophy may need spinal fusion surgery to treat scoliosis, or heart surgery to implant a pacemaker . Muscular Dystrophy Complications The complications of muscular dystrophy depend on the type. Some types are mild, while others are serious and get worse very fast. Worsening muscle weakness can affect the ability to walk, breathe, swallow, and speak. Complications of muscular dystrophy can include: Breathing problems . Progressive weakness in the breathing muscles (diaphragm) makes it hard to take a breath. That raises the risk for lung infections such as pneumonia. Curving of the spine (scoliosis). Weakness in the muscles supporting the backbone causes the spine to become curved. Most people with Duchenne muscular dystrophy need scoliosis surgery. Heart problems. Some types of muscular dystrophy cause abnormal and dangerous changes in the heartbeat. You need a pacemaker to regulate it. Muscular dystrophy can also cause the heart muscle to become weak ( cardiomyopathy ). That leads to heart failure . Swallowing difficulty. Weakness affects the muscles in the esophagus , and causes problems with chewing and swallowing. This can lead to choking. Some people with muscular dystrophy will need a feeding tube . Shortening of the tendons or muscles around the joints (contractures). Bracing and tendon release surgery can help prevent some contractures. Vision problems. Some types of muscular dystrophy cause clouding of the eye lens ( cataracts ). Need for a wheelchair. Weakness in the large muscles of the legs makes it difficult to walk, stand, kneel, or climb. Some people with muscular dystrophy eventually need to use a wheelchair."
2,Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy,"Munchausen syndrome by proxy (MSP) -- or Munchausen by proxy -- is a psychological disorder marked by attention-seeking behavior by a caregiver through those who are in their care. MSP is a relatively rare behavioral disorder. It affects a primary caretaker, often the mother. The person with MSP gains attention by seeking medical help for exaggerated or made-up symptoms of a child in their care. As health care providers strive to identify what's causing the child's symptoms, the deliberate actions of the parent or caretaker can often make the symptoms worse. The person with MSP does not seem to be motivated by a desire for any type of material gain. While health care providers are often unable to identify the specific cause of the child's illness, they may not suspect the parent or caretaker of doing anything to harm the child. In fact the caregiver often appears to be very loving and caring and extremely distraught over their child's illness. People with MSP may create or exaggerate a child's symptoms in several ways. They may simply lie about symptoms, alter tests (such as contaminating a urine sample), falsify medical records, or they may actually induce symptoms through various means, such as poisoning, suffocating, starving, and causing infection. What Are the Symptoms of Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy? Certain characteristics are common in a person with MSP, including: Is a parent or caregiver, usually a mother May be a health care professional Is very friendly and cooperative with the health care providers Appears quite concerned (some may seem overly concerned) about their child May suffer from Munchausen syndrome (a related disorder in which a person repeatedly acts as if they have a physical or mental illness when they are not really sick) Other possible warning signs of MSP include: The child has a history of many hospitalizations, often with a strange set of symptoms. Worsening of the child's symptoms generally is reported by the parent and is not witnessed by the hospital staff. The child's reported condition and symptoms do not agree with the results of tests. There may be more than one unusual illness or death of children in the family. The child's condition improves in the hospital, but symptoms recur when the child returns home. Blood in lab samples may not match the blood of the child. There may be signs of chemicals in the child's blood, stool, or urine. What Causes Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy? The exact cause of MSP is not known, but researchers are looking at the roles of biological and psychological factors in its development. Some theories suggest that a history of abuse or neglect as a child, or the early loss of a parent may be factors in its development. Some evidence suggests that major stress, such as marital problems, can trigger MSP. How Common Is Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy? There are no reliable statistics regarding the number of people in the U.S. who suffer from MSP, and it is difficult to assess how common the disorder is because many cases go undetected. How Is Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy Diagnosed? Diagnosing MSP is very difficult because of the dishonesty that is involved. Doctors must rule out any possible physical illness as the cause of the child's symptoms before a diagnosis of MSP can be made. If a physical cause of the symptoms is not found, a thorough review of the child's medical history, as well as a review of the family history and the parent's medical history (many have Munchausen syndrome themselves) may provide clues to suggest MSP. Remember, it is the adult, not the child, who is diagnosed with MSP. How Is Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy Treated? The first concern in MSP is to ensure the safety and protection of any real or potential victims. This may require that the child be placed in the care of another. In fact, managing a case involving MSP often requires a team that includes a social worker, foster care organizations, and law enforcement, as well as doctors. Successful treatment of people with MSP is difficult because those with the disorder often deny there is a problem. In addition, treatment success is dependent on the person telling the truth, and people with MSP tend to be such accomplished liars that they begin to have trouble telling fact from fiction. Psychotherapy (a type of counseling) generally focuses on changing the thinking and behavior of the individual with the disorder (cognitive-behavioral therapy). The goal of therapy for MSP is to help the person identify the thoughts and feelings that are contributing to the behavior, and to learn to form relationships that are not associated with being ill. What Is the Outlook for Victims of People With Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy? This disorder can lead to serious short- and long-term complications, including continued abuse, multiple hospitalizations, and the death of the victim. (Research suggests that the death rate for victims of MSP is about 10%.) In some situations, a child victim of MSP learns to relate getting attention to being sick and develops Munchausen syndrome themselves. What Is the Outlook for People With Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy? In general, MSP is a very difficult disorder to treat and often requires years of therapy and support. In addition, MSP is considered a form of child abuse, which is a criminal offense. Can Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy Be Prevented? There is no known way to prevent this disorder."
3,What Is Basal Ganglia Calcification?,"Basal ganglia calcification is a very rare condition that happens when calcium builds up in your brain , usually in the basal ganglia, the part of your brain that helps control movement. Other parts of your brain can be affected as well. You're most likely to get basal ganglia calcification between the ages of 30 and 60, though it can happen at any time. Most people who develop it are in good health before they find out they have it. It should not be confused with familial idiopathic basal ganglia calcification or primary familial brain calcification, also called Fahr’s disease or Fahr’s syndrome. As the name suggests, this form of basal ganglia calcification is inherited, but it is also rare and more serious. It is a progressive disease with no known cure. Calcification can occur in many parts of the brain and is most commonly benign with no symptoms and not associated with Fahr's disease. Causes Basal ganglia calcification sometimes happens when you age. Calcium build-up in your basal ganglia can also happen because of infection, problems with your parathyroid gland, and for other reasons. Symptoms In most cases, you may have no symptoms at all. But if you do, there are usually two types: either movement-related or psychiatric. The exact symptoms depend on which part of your brain is affected. Movement symptoms: Clumsiness Walking unsteadily Talking more slowly than usual, or slurring your words Difficulty swallowing Involuntary movement of arms or legs Cramped muscles Stiff arms and legs (called spasticity) Tremors, muscle stiffness, lack of facial expression Psychiatric symptoms: Poor concentration Lapses in memory Mood changes Psychosis , or being out of touch with reality Dementia Other symptoms: Tiredness Migraines Seizures Vertigo , or dizziness Not being able to control when you urinate (called urinary incontinence ) Impotence Diagnosis Your doctors usually start with symptoms and family history. A CT scan , which combines many X-rays to make detailed pictures of parts of your body, is the most common imaging test used to detect it. But if there is calcification, they can’t always tell if it's because of the condition or something else. Imaging tests like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and X-rays might also show if there’s any calcium build-up in your brain. Your doctor might do special urine and blood tests to help rule out other problems. Testing of your genes is also possible if other things point to the illness. Treatment There is no cure, but there is treatment for the symptoms. For example, if you are anxious or depressed, see your doctor. There are medicines to help with mood issues. If you have seizures, certain anti-epileptic medicines can help. Or if you have migraines, you can take medicine to both prevent and treat them. If you have this condition, it’s a good idea to see your doctor or specialist every year to see if it’s changed or advanced."
4,Understanding Fainting: The Basics,"What Is Fainting? Fainting, also called syncope (pronounced SIN-ko-pee), is a sudden, brief loss of consciousness and posture caused by decreased blood flow to the brain. Many different conditions can cause fainting. These include heart problems such as irregular heartbeats,  low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), anemia (a deficiency in healthy oxygen-carrying cells), and problems with how the nervous system regulates blood pressure. Some types of fainting seem to run in families. While fainting may happen because of a particular medical condition, sometimes it may occur in an otherwise healthy person. Fainting is a particular problem for the elderly, who may suffer serious injuries from falls when they faint. Most episodes are very brief. In most cases, the individual who has fainted regains complete consciousness within just a few minutes. Fainting is a common problem, accounting for 3% of emergency room visits and 6% of hospital admissions. A person may feel faint and lightheaded (presyncope) or lose consciousness (syncope). What Causes Fainting? Fainting may have a variety of causes. A simple episode, also called a vasovagal attack or neurally mediated syncope, is the most common type of fainting spell. It is most common in children and young adults. A vasovagal attack happens because blood pressure drops , reducing circulation to the brain and causing loss of consciousness. Typically an attack occurs while standing and is frequently preceded by a sensation of warmth, nausea, lightheadedness, and visual ""grayout."" If the syncope is prolonged, it can trigger something called a convulsive syncope which is similar to a seizure. You may have a simple fainting spell due to anxiety , fear, pain, intense emotional stress, hunger, or use of alcohol or drugs. Most people who have a simple fainting spell have no underlying heart or neurological (nerve or brain) problem. Some people have a problem with the way their body regulates their blood pressure, particularly when they move too quickly from a lying or sitting position to a standing position. This condition is called postural hypotension and may be severe enough to cause fainting. This type of fainting is more common in the elderly, people who recently had a lengthy illness that kept them in bed, and people who have poor muscle tone. The following can cause fainting, too: Diseases of the autonomic nervous system . Your autonomic nervous system is the part of the nervous system that controls involuntary vital functions, such as the beating of your heart, the degree to which your blood vessels are constricted, and breathing. Autonomic nervous system problems include acute or subacute dysautonomia, chronic post-ganglionic autonomic insufficiency, and chronic pre-ganglionic autonomic insufficiency. If you have one of these disorders, you are likely to have other symptoms, such as erectile dysfunction (inability to have or maintain an erection), loss of bladder and bowel control, loss of the normal reflexes of your pupils, or decreased sweating, tearing, and salivation. Conditions that interfere with the parts of the nervous system that regulate blood pressure and heart rate . These conditions include diabetes, alcoholism, malnutrition, and amyloidosis (in which waxy protein builds up in the tissues and organs). If you take certain high blood pressure drugs, which act on your blood vessels, you may be more likely to faint. If you are dehydrated, which may affect the amount of blood in your body and, thus, your blood pressure, you may be more likely to faint. Heart or blood vessel problems that interfere with blood flow to the brain . These may include heart block (a problem with the electrical impulses that control your heart muscle), problems with the sinus node (a specialized area of your heart that helps it beat), heart arrhythmia (irregular heart rhythm), a blood clot in the lungs, an abnormally narrowed aortic heart valve, or certain other problems with the structure of your heart. Conditions that may cause unusual patterns of stimulation to particular nerves. These include micturition syncope (fainting during or after urination), glossopharyngeal neuralgia (fainting due to inflammation and pain in a particular nerve to the mouth); cough syncope (fainting after intense coughing), and stretch syncope (fainting that occurs when stretching the neck and arms). Hyperventilation . If you become intensely anxious or panicked and breathe too quickly, you may feel faint from hyperventilation (taking in too much oxygen and getting rid of too much carbon dioxide too quickly). Vagus nerve stimulation or irritation. This is also called vasovagal syncope. When your vagus nerve gets stimulated, your heart rate and blood pressure can lower, leading to fainting. This can happen when going to the bathroom, having blood taken, receiving a shot, or experiencing extreme emotions. The Difference Between Blackout and Fainting Some people use the terms blackout and fainting interchangeably, but they are different things. A blackout is a loss of memory . Fainting, also called passing out, is a loss of consciousness. Both of these can have several different causes. What Causes a Blackout? Intoxication. One of the main causes of temporary memory loss is intoxication, often with alcohol. According to one survey, over half of undergraduate college students have blacked out from drinking at least once in their lives. When your blood alcohol level reaches 0.15%, you are likely to black out. This is nearly double the legal limit for driving in most states. A blackout from intoxication is due to a brain malfunction. Your brain stops saving the things you do as memories. You may act normally and do things like socialize, eat, drive, and drink. But your brain is impaired and does not record your memories during this time. Some people are more prone to blacking out than others. Blacking out is not always a sign that you abuse alcohol, but it can be. Some people who drink heavily can also experience a brownout. This is when you remember some of the events of the time you were drinking. Sometimes, the events can come back to you with a cue that sparks your memory. ‌Head injury. Even mild head injuries can lead to a concussion . This can cause you to have memory issues and confusion. Most of the time, if you have a concussion, you can't remember the events that led to the injury.‌ Epilepsy. Seizures can also cause memory problems. Sometimes, directly after a seizure, you can enter a state of post-ictal confusion. This means you may be confused and not remember what happened directly before the seizure or what you did after the seizure happened. Generally, your memory of those events will come back within 5-30 minutes, once the post-ictal state is over. When to See a Doctor If you faint a lot, you should visit your doctor to make sure it is not from an underlying health condition. You should also visit your doctor if you faint and have a history of heart disease . Fainting while exercising is not common and may be a cause for concern. Additionally, if you fall and hit your head, causing you to lose consciousness, you should always get evaluated by a doctor to rule out a head injury. Frequent blackouts may be a sign of an underlying medical condition. It can also be a sign that you have an alcohol use disorder. Drinking to the point of blacking out frequently can lead to other problems, like issues with long-term memory. It can also make you more likely to injure yourself accidentally while intoxicated. If you would like to stop drinking , there are resources that can help. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration has a 24-hour hotline you can call whenever you need support with mental health or substance use disorders. The number is 800-662-HELP (4357). If you use a TTY device, you can call 800-487-4889."
5,What Is Parkinson's Disease?,"Parkinson's disease is an illness that affects the part of your brain that controls how you move your body. It can come on so slowly that you don't even notice it at first. But over time, what starts as a little shakiness in your hand can have an impact on how you walk, talk, sleep , and think. You're more likely to get it when you're 60 and older. It's also possible for it to start when you're younger, but that doesn't happen nearly as often. There's no cure for Parkinson's disease , but you can get treatment and support to help manage the symptoms. What Does Parkinson's Do to the Brain? Deep down in your brain , there's an area called the substantia nigra, which is in the basal ganglia. Some of its cells make dopamine , a chemical that carries messages around your brain . When you need to scratch an itch or kick a ball, dopamine quickly carries a message to the nerve cell that controls that movement. When that system is working well, your body moves smoothly and evenly. But when you have Parkinson's, the cells of your substantia nigra start to die. There's no replacing them, so your dopamine levels drop and you can't fire off as many messages to control smooth body movements. Early on, you won't notice anything different. But as more and more cells die, you reach a tipping point where you start to have symptoms. That may not be until 80% of the cells are gone, which is why you can have Parkinson's for quite a while before you realize it. How Does Parkinson's Affect the Body? The telltale symptoms all have to do with the way you move. You usually notice problems like: Rigid muscles . It can happen on just about any part of your body. Doctors sometimes mistake early Parkinson's for arthritis . Slow movements . You may find that even simple acts, like buttoning a shirt, take much longer than usual. Tremors . Your hands, arms, legs, lips, jaw, or tongue are shaky when you're not using them. Walking and balance problems . You may notice your arms aren't swinging as freely when you walk. Or you can't take long steps, so you have to shuffle instead. Parkinson's can also cause a range of other issues, from depression to bladder problems to acting out dreams . It may be a while before abnormal movements start. What Causes Parkinson's? Doctors aren't sure why all those brain cells start dying. They think it's a mix of your genes and something in the environment, but the reason is not straightforward. Someone could have a change in a gene tied to Parkinson's, but never get the disease. That happens a lot. And a bunch of people could work side by side in a place with chemicals linked to Parkinson's, but only a few of them end up with it. It's a complex puzzle, and scientists are still trying to put all the pieces together. How Will My Doctor Test for It? There's no one test for Parkinson's . A lot of it's based on your symptoms and health history, but it could take some time to figure it out. Part of the process is ruling out other conditions that look like Parkinson's. The docotor may do a DaT scan, which looks for dopamine in the brain. This can aid in a diagnosis. Because there is no single test, it's very important to go to a doctor who knows a lot about it, early on. It's easy to miss. If you do have it, your doctor might use what's called the Hoehn and Yahr scale to tell you what stage of the disease you're in. It ranks how severe your symptoms are from 1 to 5, where 5 is the most serious. The stage can help you get a better feel for where your symptoms fall and what to expect as the disease gets worse. But keep in mind, some people could take up to 20 years to move from mild to more serious symptoms. For others, the change is much faster. How Is Parkinson's Treated? It's all about managing symptoms. Drugs for Parkinson's can often help with tremors, stiff muscles, and slow movements. Your doctor may also suggest physical therapy , occupational therapy, and speech therapy, based on how it affects you. And in some cases, you may need surgery. How Will the Disease Affect My Life? Most people who have Parkinson’s live a normal to a nearly normal lifespan, but the disease can be life changing. For some people, treatment keeps the symptoms at bay, and they're mostly mild. For others, the disease is much more serious and really limits what you're able to do. As it gets worse, it makes it harder and harder to do daily activities like getting out of bed, driving, or going to work. Even writing can seem like a tough task. And in later stages, it can cause dementia . Even though Parkinson's can have a big impact on your life, with the right treatment and help from your health care team, you can still enjoy the things you love. It's important to reach out to family and friends for support. Learning to live with Parkinson's means making sure you get the backing you need."
6,Tetralogy of Fallot,"Tetralogy of Fallot Overview Tetralogy of Fallot occurs in approximately 400 out of every million live births. This congenital heart condition causes mixing of oxygen-poor blood with oxygen-rich blood, which is then pumped out of the heart into the circulatory system of blood vessels. The blood leaving the heart has less oxygen than is needed by the organs and tissues of the body, a condition called hypoxemia. Chronic (ongoing, long-term) lack of oxygen causes cyanosis, a bluish color of the skin , lips, and membranes inside the mouth and nose. The normal heart works as follows: The heart is made up of 4 chambers: 2 upper chambers called atria and 2 lower, larger chambers called ventricles. Each atrium is separated from its paired ventricle by a valve. The heart has a left and a right side. The left and right sides of the heart are separated by a septum (wall). The right side of the heart receives oxygen-depleted or blue blood returning by veins (superior vena cava and inferior vena cava) from the body. The blood flows from the right atrium through the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle, which pumps it through the pulmonic valve into the pulmonary artery, the main artery to the lungs. In the lungs, the blood absorbs oxygen and then returns to the left atrium through the pulmonary veins. From the left atrium, the blood is pumped through the mitral valve to the left ventricle. The left ventricle pumps the blood out of the heart into the circulatory system via a large artery known as the aorta. The blood moves throughout the body, supplying oxygen and nutrients to organs and cells. Organs cannot work properly if they do not receive enough oxygen-rich blood. The 4 abnormalities (tetralogy) of the heart described by Fallot include the following: Right ventricular hypertrophy: Right ventricular thickening, or hypertrophy, occurs in response to narrowing or obstruction at or below the pulmonic valve, due to an increase in right ventricular work and pressure. Ventricular septal defect (VSD): This is a hole in the heart wall (septum) that separates the 2 ventricles. The hole is usually large and allows oxygen-poor blood in the right ventricle to pass through, mixing with oxygen-rich blood in the left ventricle. This poorly oxygenated blood is then pumped out of the left ventricle to the rest of the body. The body gets some oxygen, but not all that it needs. This lack of oxygen in the blood causes cyanosis. Abnormal position of the aorta: The aorta, the main artery carrying blood out of the heart and into the circulatory system, exits the heart from a position overriding the right and left ventricles. (In the normal heart, the aorta exits from the left ventricle.) Pulmonary valve stenosis (PS): The major issue with tetralogy of Fallot is the severity of pulmonary valve stenosis, since VSD is always present. If the stenosis is mild, minimal cyanosis occurs, since the oxygen-poor blood from the right ventricle can pass through the pulmonic valve to the lungs and less of it passes through the VSD. However, if the PS is moderate to severe, a smaller amount of blood reaches the lungs, since most is shunted right-to-left through the VSD. Tetralogy of Fallot accounts for 10%-15% of all congenital ( newborn ) heart defects. Infants with this abnormality develop signs of the condition very early in life. Tetralogy of Fallot Causes Tetralogy of Fallot occurs during development of the fetus, before birth, and is therefore termed a congenital birth defect. An error occurs as the fetal heart separates into the chambers, valves, and other structures that make up the normal human heart. No one is really sure why this occurs. Tetralogy of Fallot Symptoms Most infants with tetralogy of Fallot develop cyanosis in the first year of life. The skin, lips, and mucous membranes inside the mouth and nose take on a noticeably dusky blue color. Only some infants with very severe obstruction of the right ventricle outflow turn blue at birth. A small number of children with tetralogy of Fallot never turn blue at all, especially if the pulmonary stenosis is mild, the ventricular septal defect is small, or both. In some children, the cyanosis is quite subtle and may go undetected for some time. The following symptoms suggest tetralogy of Fallot: Growth and development are slower, especially if the pulmonary stenosis is severe. Puberty may be delayed if the tetralogy is untreated. The child usually tires easily and begins panting with any form of exertion. They may play for only a short time before sitting or lying down. Once able to walk, the child often assumes a squatting position to catch their breath and then resumes physical activity. Squatting increases the pressure transiently in the aorta and left ventricle, causing less blood to move into the left ventricle, more out the pulmonary artery to the lungs. Episodes of extreme blue coloring (called hypercyanosis or simply ""tet spells"") occur in many children, usually in the first 2-3 years of life. The child suddenly becomes blue, has difficulty breathing, and may become extremely irritable or even faint. 20%-70% of children with tetralogy of Fallot experience these spells. The spells often happen during feeding, crying, straining, or on awakening in the morning. Spells can last from a few minutes to a few hours. When to Seek Medical Care Sometimes tetralogy of Fallot goes undiagnosed for several months to a year. Diagnosing conditions such as tetralogy of Fallot is one of the goals of routine checkups with your doctor. Take your child to their health care provider if the child develops a bluish color, has breathing difficulties, seizures, fainting, fatigue, slow growth, or developmental delay. A medical professional should establish the cause of these problems. If you cannot reach your child's health care provider or if the child develops any of the following symptoms, take the child to a hospital emergency department right away: Bluish discoloration Trouble breathing Seizures Fainting Extreme fatigue or weakness Exams and Tests Even if the bluish color and other symptoms have resolved by the time the child gets medical attention, the health care provider will immediately suspect a heart problem. Medical tests will focus on identifying the cause of the cyanosis. Lab tests: The red blood cell count and hemoglobin may be elevated as the body attempts to compensate for the lack of oxygen to the tissues. Electrocardiogram (ECG): This painless, quick test measures and records the electrical activity of the heart. Structural abnormalities of the heart usually produce abnormal recordings on ECG. In tetralogy of Fallot, right ventricular hypertrophy is almost always present. Chest X-ray imaging: This image may demonstrate the classic ""boot-shaped heart."" This occurs because the right ventricle is enlarged. It also may show an abnormal aorta. Echocardiography: This imaging test is key. It will demonstrate the ventricular septal defect or large hole between the left and right ventricles, the degree of pulmonary stenosis, and it will reveal other unanticipated defects. Many patients do not need cardiac catheterization if the clinical, ECG, and echocardiogram findings are routine and as expected. Cardiac catheterization: This is an invasive procedure accomplished by a cardiologist in a special laboratory with the patient under local or general anesthesia. This procedure was done on all patients with suspected tetralogy prior to echocardiography because it was the only procedure that could be used to confirm the diagnosis. If needed, a small tube (catheter) is inserted through the skin into a blood vessel (usually in the groin) and advanced up the inferior vena cava into the heart. An x-ray image is taken while a small amount of dye is infused. The dye helps highlight the ventricular septal defect, pulmonary stenosis, overriding aorta, and the size of the pulmonary arteries. Tetralogy of Fallot Treatment Self-Care at Home If your child starts to turn blue, place the child on their back in the knee-to-chest position and call 911 or your local emergency number. Medical Treatment Surgery is the primary way to correct the heart problem. Your child may be prescribed medication for tet spells. You will also be given information for dealing with future tet spells. The child will be placed on their back in the knee-to-chest position to increase aortic resistance. The increased aortic and left ventricular pressure reduces the rush of blood through the septal hole from the right ventricle and improves blood circulation to the lungs, so more red blood reaches the tissues. The child may be given oxygen through a face mask to increase the amount of oxygen in the blood. The child may be given morphine, propranolol (or metoprolol), or, in extreme cases, phenylephrine (Alconefrin, Vicks Sinex). These medications decrease the frequency and severity of tet spells. Surgery The Blalock-Taussig operation: A palliative procedure performed in smaller infants to increase blood flow to the lungs. This allows the child to grow big enough to have complete surgical repair. A connection is made between one of the major arteries of the body, usually the right subclavian artery, and the right pulmonary artery, which increases the amount of red oxygenated blood reaching the lungs, relieving cyanosis with dramatic relief of the patient's symptoms. Total correction: The hole in the ventricular septum (between the ventricles) is closed with a patch and the obstruction to right ventricular outflow, pulmonic stenosis, is opened. These corrections allow blood flow to the lungs for oxygenation before being pumped out into the body. The timing of the operation depends on symptoms. Surgery usually is performed within the first 2 years of life. Operative mortality rates have dramatically dropped over the last 20 years. Still, about 1%-5% of children who undergo complete correction die during or immediately after the procedure, secondary to other additional defects in the body and/or heart, and the heart lung bypass procedure itself. Next Steps Follow-up Your health care provider should schedule regular follow-up visits for your child. At these visits, the child should be checked for abnormal heart rhythms, which may develop in children who have undergone surgical correction for tetralogy of Fallot. Outlook After successful surgery, children generally don't have any symptoms and lead normal lives with few, if any, restrictions. However, the surgery itself may have some long-term complications. These include the following: Right ventricular failure: Right ventricular failure is possible, especially if surgery created severe pulmonary valve insufficiency, which is leaking of blood backward from the pulmonary artery into the right ventricle. Electrical conduction abnormalities: Every patient with tetralogy of Fallot has right bundle branch block secondary to the congenital ventricular septal defect. But sewing the patch into the ventricular septum can create heart block or failure of the upper atria to conduct/communicate with the lower ventricles. A permanent pacemaker is occasionally needed. Arrhythmias: Because of surgery on the ventricles, postoperative ventricular tachycardia (VT) is an infrequent risk. This is a life-threatening arrhythmia, so follow-up to detect risk for ventricular tachycardia is important. Residual hole in the ventricular septum: This is also possible, with oxygenated blood passing from the left side of the heart to the right (shunting).

7,Understanding Encephalitis: The Basics,"What Is Encephalitis? Encephalitis (pronounced en-sef-uh- lie -tis) is inflammation of your brain tissue. It can be very serious and may cause personality changes, seizures , weakness, and other symptoms, depending on the part of your brain affected. Encephalitis is an inflammation in your brain. Most cases are caused by infection with a virus, such as the herpes simplex virus. (Photo Credit: Science Photo Library/Getty Images) Encephalitis is rare, affecting about 10-15 in 100,000 people each year in the U.S. Young children, older adults, and those with a weak immune system are most vulnerable. It's usually caused by an infection with viruses, bacteria, fungi, or parasites, although it can be caused by an autoimmune condition or some medicines as well. Most people who have mild encephalitis fully recover. Your treatment and chance of recovery depend on the cause and severity of your inflammation. In acute encephalitis, the infection directly affects your brain cells. In parainfectious encephalitis, your brain and spinal cord become inflamed within 1-2 weeks of contracting an infection (usually viral or bacterial) . Encephalitis vs. meningitis Encephalitis and meningitis are both diseases that cause inflammation in your brain. However, while encephalitis is an inflammation of your brain tissue, meningitis is an inflammation of the membranes that cover your brain and spinal cord (called meninges). Like encephalitis, meningitis is often caused by a viral or bacterial infection, but it can also be caused by fungal or parasitic infections, injuries, certain drugs, and some types of cancer. Is encephalitis contagious? Swelling in your brain isn’t contagious, but the causes can be. For example, viral encephalitis can be caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV) that can pass from person to person. Childhood diseases, such as measles, mumps, and German measles (Rubella), used to be a common cause of viral encephalitis in kids, but these causes are a bit rarer now since most people get vaccinated against them before they start school. Encephalitis Causes Viral infections with any of the following three groups of viruses are the most common cause of encephalitis. These include: Herpes viruses, which include HSV (especially HSV-1), chickenpox, cytomegalovirus, and Epstein-Barr virus Viruses that are transmitted through bugbites, such as West Nile virus , Dengue virus, and Eastern equine encephalitis virus Viruses that cause childhood infections, such as measles, mumps, and Rubella Less commonly, encephalitis may be caused by: Infection with HIV or the virus that causes rabies Bacterial and other infections, such as syphilis or toxoplasmosis (an infection with a parasite from infected cat poop) Autoimmune conditions Some kinds of cancer Some medicines Sometimes, your doctor may not be able to tell what caused your encephalitis. Encephalitis Types Infectious encephalitis It is usually caused by a viral infection but can also be caused by bacteria, fungi, and parasites. As it's usually caused by viral infections, it's more common in people who are exposed to bugs that can transmit diseases, such as people who spend a lot of time outdoors, especially near standing water. Infectious encephalitis can develop quickly and the symptoms can be serious. Autoimmune encephalitis It is usually caused by proteins that your body makes in your brain. These proteins cause inflammation in your brain. Doctors don't yet know for sure why some people develop these proteins, while other people don't. Autoimmune encephalitis tends to develop more slowly than infectious encephalitis and may cause more neurological symptoms, such as confusion, memory issues, and seizures. It's also rarer than infectious encephalitis. Some conditions that are linked to autoimmune encephalitis include: Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis Hashimoto’s encephalopathy LGI1/CASPR2-antibody encephalitis Limbic encephalitis Rasmussen’s encephalitis Both infectious and autoimmune encephalitis can cause serious, life-threatening symptoms. If you or someone else has neurological symptoms, such as irritability, seizures, or extreme drowsiness, call 911 or go to the emergency room right away. Encephalitis Symptoms Your symptoms depend on the type of encephalitis you have. People with infectious encephalitis may have symptoms of an infection before they get encephalitis. Signs of encephalitis can include: Fatigue or loss of energy Fever, especially a high fever Headache that can be severe Sensitivity to light and sound Mild-to-moderate neck stiffness Drowsiness or loss of consciousness Irritability, anxiety, and behavioral or personality changes Hallucinations Signs of severe encephalitis may include: Weakness or trouble moving some parts of your body Double vision Confusion, trouble speaking, or difficulty understanding when someone talks to you Coma Seizures A bulging soft spot (fontanel) in infants Go to the ER or call 911 right away if you or someone else has any signs of severe encephalitis. Encephalitis Diagnosis Your doctor will ask about your symptoms, including how long you've had them. Because people with encephalitis can be disoriented, family and friends are key to getting a good history. It's important to know if you've come into contact with mosquitoes or ticks , infected animals, or sick people. Your doctor will also do a physical exam and may order some tests. Encephalitis tests Some of the tests your doctor may use include: Blood tests, including a complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel Urine, stool, or sputum culture tests to see if you have an infection and what type you have Imaging tests, such as CT scans, MRI scans, and magnetoencephalography (MEG) to see where in your brain you are having seizures Electroencephalogram (EEG) to look for seizers or specific electrical activity in your brain Spinal tap (lumbar puncture) to remove cerebrospinal fluid to find infections in your brain or spinal cord A neurological exam, which is a series of tests that show how well your nervous system is working An intracranial pressure monitoring (ICP) to measure the pressure inside your skull Rarely, a biopsy of your brain tissue to look at under a microscope Encephalitis Risk Factors Several risk factors could increase your chance of getting encephalitis. These include: Age. Young children and older adults are at a higher risk for viral encephalitis. Some types of autoimmune encephalitis are more common in children and young adults. Having a weakened immune system. This could be because you have HIV, take medicines for cancer, or have a condition such as diabetes. Having an autoimmune condition. Smoking. Living in areas where mosquito- or tick-borne viruses spread easily, particularly in the summer months. Encephalitis Treatment Because the complications from encephalitis can be serious, you may need to go to the hospital. You will usually need monitoring for your blood pressure, heart rate, and breathing. You will also usually need IV fluid therapy to help keep your brain from swelling more. Otherwise, your treatment will depend on your age, condition, and the cause of your disease. Some common treatments include: Steroids that can help reduce swelling in your brain Antiviral drugs, such as acyclovir (Zovirax), Foscarnet (Foscavir), or Ganciclovir (Cytovene) for people who have viral encephalitis Antibiotics for people with bacterial encephalitis Anticonvulsant therapy for people with seizures Immune globulin and plasmapheresis for people with autoimmune encephalitis Over-the-counter medicines, such as acetaminophen, that can help control fever and headaches Supportive care Supportive care is a type of care for patients who are seriously ill. The goal is to focus your treatment on what is most important to you. This may involve, for instance, focusing on relieving your symptoms and how other treatments will affect how you feel. You usually get supportive care alongside specific treatments for your condition. Examples of supportive care may include: Use of a ventilator or other breathing help, such as an oxygen mask IV fluids to keep you hydrated Medications for pain, inflammation, infection, seizures, and other issues Post encephalitis therapy Once you have been treated for encephalopathy and the inflammation is gone, you may still need some treatment and support to continue your recovery. Some people need help such as: Physical therapy to help regain your muscle strength to stand, walk, or perform regular tasks. Occupational therapy (OT), which often works hand in hand with physical therapy. OT helps you work on your everyday skills and may give you ideas for adaptations, such as special tools, if you need help with some of your day-to-day activities. Speech therapy, which helps you regain or fine-tune your ability to speak or communicate clearly. Brain rehabilitation or retraining, which helps you improve your memory and your cognition. Psychotherapy, which helps you learn how to cope with changes in your life and manage your moods and behavior. Encephalitis Complications After you recover from the swelling in your brain, from encephalitis, you may have long-term damage in your brain that needs ongoing medical care. For instance, some people may have long-term problems, such as: Memory loss (amnesia) Personality and behavioral changes Emotional and psychological problems, such as anxiety, depression, and mood swings Problems with attention, concentration, planning, and problem-solving Repeated seizures (epilepsy) Hearing loss Speech and language problems Problems swallowing Problems with balance, coordination, and movement Long-term fatigue In severe cases, loss of consciousness (coma) and death Encephalitis Prevention The best way to avoid getting encephalitis is to avoid the germs that can cause it. Here are some tips: Get yourself and your kids vaccinated, as recommended by your doctors. The elimination of smallpox and the availability of vaccines that prevent mumps , measles , and rubella have lowered cases of encephalitis , especially in children. If you're traveling in an area that has a high risk of tick-borne or mosquito-borne viruses, make sure you get vaccinated before you head out. The CDC's website has a travelers' health page where you can look up your destination and get a list of all the recommended vaccines for that location. Wash your hands completely and often with soap and water throughout your day, especially before you handle food, eat or drink, and after using the bathroom. Don't share food, eating utensils, or glasses. Don't share personal-care items and remind your kids not to share their things, such as razors, towels, makeup, or toothbrushes. Take these steps to avoid getting bitten by mosquitoes and ticks: Avoid being outside between dusk and dawn when mosquitoes are most likely to bite you. If do have to be out then, wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants. Make sure mosquitoes can't get into your house through broken screens and windows. Also, run a fan, which can keep mosquitos moving around so they're less likely to land on and bite you. Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants when you're in wooded areas with tall grasses and shrubs, where ticks like to hang out. Check yourself, your kids, and your pets for ticks when they come inside during tick season (this can be year-round for people in the U.S. South and on the West Coast, but for most of the U.S., it's early spring to winter). Use bug repellent and insecticide. You can use the mosquito repellent DEET on both your skin and clothes. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recommends spraying your clothes, tents, and outdoor gear with products that contain permethrin to repel and kill both mosquitoes and ticks. Don't spray permethrin on your skin, though. For infants younger than 2 months, you can't use insect repellent, so cover their carrier or stroller with mosquito netting. For infants and children older than 2 months old, you can use 10%-30% DEET products. Don't use a combined sunscreen and DEET product because you'll need to reapply sunscreen for a full day of outside play. Reapplying a DEET-containing product can expose your child to high levels of DEET. Get rid of standing water outside your house. Mosquitoes lay their eggs in standing water. Common problem areas for standing water are old flowerpots, flat roofs, old tires, and clogged gutters. Report any sick or dying birds or small animals to your local health department. They could be infected with viruses such as West Nile virus that cause encephalitis. Encephalitis Prognosis Your symptoms can last anywhere from a few days to a couple of months. Some people with complications may take another few months to fully recover. However, with treatment, most people recover from encephalitis. Your outlook depends on a few things, such as: What caused your encephalitis. Some causes, such as an HSV infection, may cause fewer issues, so people with encephalitis caused by HSV may have an easier recovery than other people. Your level of inflammation. High levels of brain inflammation can cause more long-term issues that complicate your recovery. Your age. Adults may have a harder time recovering from encephalitis. Your overall health. If you have preexisting health issues or a weakened immune system, it can make your recovery more difficult. How long it took you to be diagnosed. The longer it takes you to get treatment, the higher your chance of having a difficult recovery and lasting complications. Takeaways Encephalitis is a condition that involves inflammation and swelling in your brain. It's usually caused by infection with a virus, especially HSV. It isn’t always preventable, but you can lower your risk by avoiding infection with a germ that could lead to encephalitis. This means getting your recommended vaccines and avoiding or protecting yourself when in areas that have ticks and mosquitoes. If you have signs or symptoms of encephalitis, you should get to the doctor right away. Quick diagnosis and treatment can make your recovery easier and limit lasting effects. Although some people do experience complications, most people fully recover. Encephalitis FAQs What is the life expectancy of people with encephalitis? Most people fully recover from encephalitis and go on to live a normal life. People with mild cases may recover in a week, while people with serious cases may have complications that take months of added recovery time. One study showed that about 5% of people who are hospitalized with encephalitis die while they are in the hospital. Can encephalitis resolve on its own? If you have mild encephalitis, it can recover on its own over several weeks. Severe cases of encephalitis, however, can be life-threatening. You can't necessarily tell from your symptoms how serious your case is, so if you suspect you have encephalitis, you need to go to the doctor."
8,What Is Chordoma?,"Chordoma is a kind of cancer that grows in the bones of your skull and spine. It's very rare. Only 1 out of every 1 million people gets it. About 300 people are diagnosed with chordoma in the United States each year. You can get it at any age -- even in childhood. But most people are diagnosed between ages 40 and 70. Men get it more often than women. Chordomas can form anywhere in your back, neck, or skull. Many grow in the bottom of your spine or at the base of your skull. From there, they can spread to other organs, like your lungs . But they usually grow slowly. Because they're close to important areas like the brain and spinal cord, they need to be treated very carefully. Causes In the womb, a baby has a thin bar called a notochord that runs along their back. This bar supports the bones of the spine as they grow. The notochord disappears before the baby is born. In a small number of people, some of the notochord cells are left behind in the spine and skull. Doctors believe chordoma starts because of a change in the gene that carries instructions for making a protein that helps the spine form. This change causes notochord cells that are left in the brain or spinal cord to divide too quickly. This change usually happens randomly -- no one in your family has to have chordoma for you to get it. But it can run in families in rare instances. Symptoms Chordomas can press on nerves in your spine or brain . This can cause pain , numbness, or weakness. Your symptoms depend on where the cancer is and how big it is. Chordoma in the skull causes symptoms like: Abnormal eye movements Changes to your voice or speech Double vision Headache Loss of feeling and movement in your face Neck pain Trouble swallowing Chordoma of the spine causes symptoms like: Loss of control over your bowels Lump in the lower part of your back Numbness, tingling, or weakness in your arms or legs Pain in your lower back Problems controlling your bladder Sometimes, chordomas in the brain can block the flow of fluid there and in the spine. The fluid can build up and put pressure on the brain. This is called hydrocephalus . Diagnosis Your doctor can do imaging tests to see where the cancer is inside your body and how big it's grown. These include: X-ray: Low doses of radiation are used to make images of your brain or spinal cord. CT (computed tomography) scan: X-rays are taken from several different angles and put together to make detailed pictures of the affected area. MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): Powerful magnets and radio waves are used to make pictures of organs and other structures inside your body. A biopsy is the only test that can confirm you have chordoma. Your doctor will use a needle to take a small sample of cells from the tumor. A specialist will look at the cells under a microscope to see what kind of tumor you have. Your doctor might also do a blood test, a CT scan of your lungs , or a bone scan to see if the tumor has spread. Treatment Your treatment will depend on: Your age Your health Size of the tumor Where the tumor is Often, doctors remove the tumor with surgery. Taking out as much of the tumor as possible and some of the tissue around it can stop it from coming back. Sometimes surgeons can't remove the whole tumor because they might damage healthy cells in your brain or spine. Radiation -- high energy X-rays -- can kill any cancer cells that are left behind after surgery. This lowers the chance that the cancer will return. Still, chordoma often comes back after treatment. During the first year after your surgery, your doctor will check you with an MRI about once every 3 months to make sure it hasn't. If it does come back, you might need another surgery. Researchers are studying several new treatments for chordoma. They test these in clinical trials to see if they're safe and if they work. These are often a way for people to try a new therapy that isn't available to everyone. Your doctor can tell you if there's a trial that might be a good fit for you."
9,Heart Disease and Cardiomyopathy,"Cardiomyopathy , or heart muscle disease, is a type of progressive heart disease in which the heart is abnormally enlarged, thickened, and/or stiffened. As a result, the heart muscle's ability to pump blood is less efficient, often causing heart failure and the backup of blood into the lungs or rest of the body. The disease can also cause abnormal heart rhythms . There are three main types of cardiomyopathy: Dilated cardiomyopathy Ischemic cardiomyopathy Restrictive cardiomyopathy"
10,Amyloidosis,"Amyloidosis is when an abnormal protein called amyloid builds up in your tissues and organs. When it does, it affects their shape and how they work. Amyloidosis is a serious health problem that can lead to life-threatening organ failure. Causes and Types of Amyloidosis Many different proteins can lead to amyloid deposits, but only a few have been linked to major health problems. The type of protein and where it collects tells the type of amyloidosis you have. Amyloid deposits may collect throughout your body or in just one area. The different types of amyloidosis include: AL amyloidosis (immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis). This is the most common type and used to be called primary amyloidosis. AL stands for “amyloid light chains,” which is the type of protein responsible for the condition. There’s no known cause, but it happens when your bone marrow makes abnormal antibodies that can’t be broken down. It’s linked with a blood cancer called multiple myeloma. It can affect your kidneys, heart, liver, intestines, and nerves. AA amyloidosis. Previously known as secondary amyloidosis, this condition is the result of another chronic infectious or inflammatory disease such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn’s disease, or ulcerative colitis. It mostly affects your kidneys, but it can also affect your digestive tract, liver, and heart. AA means the amyloid type A protein causes this type. Dialysis-related amyloidosis (DRA). This is more common in older adults and people who have been on dialysis for more than 5 years. This form of amyloidosis is caused by deposits of beta-2 microglobulin that build up in the blood. Deposits can build up in many different tissues, but it most commonly affects bones, joints, and tendons. Familial, or hereditary, amyloidosis. This is a rare form passed down through families. It often affects the liver, nerves, heart, and kidneys. Many genetic defects are linked to a higher chance of amyloid disease. For example, an abnormal protein like transthyretin (TTR) is usually the cause. Age-related (senile) systemic amyloidosis. This is caused by deposits of normal TTR in the heart and other tissues. It happens most commonly in older men. Organ-specific amyloidosis. This causes deposits of amyloid protein in single organs, including the skin (cutaneous amyloidosis). Though some types of amyloid deposits have been linked to Alzheimer's disease, the brain is rarely affected by amyloidosis that happens throughout your body. Risk Factors for Amyloidosis Men get amyloidosis more often than women. Your risk for amyloidosis goes up as you grow older. Amyloidosis affects 15% of patients with a form of cancer called multiple myeloma. Amyloidosis may also happen in people with end-stage kidney disease who are on dialysis for a long time (see ""Dialysis-related amyloidosis"" above). Symptoms of Amyloidosis Symptoms of amyloidosis are often subtle. They can also vary greatly depending on where the amyloid protein is collecting in the body. It is important to note that the symptoms described below may be due to a variety of health problems. Only your doctor can make a diagnosis of amyloidosis. General symptoms of amyloidosis may include: Changes in skin color Severe fatigue Feeling of fullness Joint pain Low red blood cell count (anemia) Shortness of breath Swelling of the tongue Tingling and numbness in legs and feet Weak hand grip Severe weakness Sudden weight loss Cardiac Amyloidosis (Stiff Heart Syndrome) This condition can cause less blood to flow to your heart muscle. Eventually, your heart will no longer be able to pump normally. Some doctors also call cardiac amyloidosis “stiff heart syndrome.” Others say a stiff heart is actually a symptom of cardiac amyloidosis. Either way, amyloid deposits in your heart can make the muscular walls of your heart stiff. They can also make your heart muscle weaker and affect the electrical rhythm of the heart. Stiff heart syndrome can be serious. It may lead to congestive heart failure if it's not successfully treated. Who’s at risk? Cardiac amyloidosis is more common in men than in women. It’s also more likely to affect older people. People under 40 rarely get the condition. You can inherit stiff heart syndrome. Other things that raise your chances of getting it are: Having untreated high blood pressure Being obese Being over 60 Having gone through menopause What are the symptoms? If amyloidosis affects your heart, some symptoms you might notice are: Shortness of breath when you're doing light activity or lying down An irregular heartbeat Signs of heart failure, including swelling of the feet and ankles, weakness, fatigue, and nausea, among others These can be signs of other health conditions, too. So see your doctor to figure out what’s going on. How is it diagnosed? Your doctor will ask you about your symptoms and whether anyone in your family has cardiac amyloidosis or other heart conditions. They’ll give you a physical exam, too. The doctor may do several tests to diagnose or rule out cardiac amyloidosis, like: Blood and urine tests Imaging tests to see inside your body, like ultrasound, echocardiogram, electrocardiogram, MRI, or CT scan Biopsy Genetic testing, if cardiac amyloidosis runs in your family What are the treatments? There’s more than one type of cardiac amyloidosis. Your treatment will depend on the type you have. Among the options your doctor might recommend are: Medications, including chemotherapy and immunotherapy A pacemaker A stem cell transplant While some of these treatments, like chemo and immunotherapy, are also used to treat cancer, cardiac amyloidosis isn't cancer. It's a disease that affects the heart muscle. There's no cure, but there are treatments for most types of cardiac amyloidosis. Getting an early diagnosis is important since treatment can prevent permanent damage. Renal (Kidney) Amyloidosis Your kidneys filter waste and toxins from your blood. Amyloid deposits in the kidneys make it hard for them to do this job. When your kidneys do not work properly, water and dangerous toxins build up in your body. If amyloidosis affects the kidneys, you may have: Signs of kidney failure, including swelling of the feet and ankles and puffiness around the eyes High levels of protein in your urine Gastrointestinal Amyloidosis Amyloid deposits along your gastrointestinal (GI) tract slow down the movement of food through your intestines. This interferes with digestion. If amyloidosis affects your GI tract, you may have: Less appetite Diarrhea Nausea Stomach pain Weight loss If your liver is affected, that can cause liver enlargement and fluid buildup in the body. Amyloid Neuropathy Amyloid deposits can damage the nerves outside your brain and spinal cord, called the peripheral nerves. The peripheral nerves carry information between your brain and spinal cord and the rest of your body. For example, they make your brain perceive pain if you burn your hand or stub your toes. If amyloidosis affects your nerves, you may have: Balance problems Problems controlling your bladder and bowel Sweating problems Tingling and weakness Lightheadedness when standing due to a problem with your body's ability to control blood pressure Diagnosing Amyloidosis A thorough physical exam and a detailed and accurate account of your medical history are crucial in helping your doctor diagnose amyloidosis. Blood and urine tests can spot abnormal proteins. Depending on your symptoms, your doctor may also check your thyroid and liver. Your doctor will do a biopsy to confirm a diagnosis of amyloidosis and know the specific type of protein you have. The tissue sample for the biopsy may be taken from your belly fat (the abdominal fat pad), bone marrow, or sometimes your mouth, rectum, or other organs. It's not always necessary to biopsy the part of the body damaged by the amyloid deposits. Imaging tests can also help. They show the amount of damage to organs like your heart, liver, or spleen. Your doctor will do a genetic test if they think you have a type that is passed down through families. Treatment for hereditary amyloidosis is different from treatment for other types of the disease. Once you’re diagnosed, your doctor might check your heart with an echocardiogram or your liver and spleen with imaging tests. Amyloidosis Treatment There is no cure for amyloidosis. Your doctor will prescribe treatments to slow the development of the amyloid protein and manage your symptoms. If amyloidosis is related to another condition, then treatment will include targeting that underlying condition. Specific treatment depends on what type of amyloidosis you have and how many organs are affected. High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant can help remove the substance that leads to amyloid formation in some people with primary AL amyloidosis. Chemotherapy medicines alone may be used to treat other patients with primary AL amyloidosis. Secondary (AA) amyloidosis is treated by controlling the underlying disorder and with powerful anti-inflammatory medicines called steroids, which fight inflammation. A liver transplant may treat the disease if you have certain types of hereditary amyloidosis. New therapies can slow the production of the abnormal protein TTR. Your doctor might also recommend a kidney transplant. Other treatments to help with symptoms include: Diuretic medicine to remove extra water from your body Thickeners to add to fluids to prevent choking if you have trouble swallowing Compression stockings to relieve swelling in your legs or feet Changes to what you eat, especially if you have gastrointestinal amyloidosis What to Expect Amyloidosis can be deadly, especially if it affects your heart or kidneys. Early diagnosis and treatment are important and can help improve survival. Researchers continue to question why some types of amyloid make people sick and how the formation of amyloid can be stopped. Studies to find new treatments are ongoing. If you have amyloidosis, consider asking your doctor if there are any clinical trials you can join, or search for one by visiting www.clinicaltrials.gov and typing in the search term ""amyloidosis."""
11,Alpha-1 Antitrypsin (AAT) Deficiency,"What Is AAT Deficiency? Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency is a condition that can cause serious lung or liver disease. Symptoms often include trouble breathing and jaundiced, or yellow, skin. It's a genetic disease, which means it's passed down to you from your parents. You get it because your liver doesn't make enough of the AAT protein, and much of what it does make gets trapped in your liver. You need this protein to protect your lungs from inflammation and damage caused by infections and irritants such as smoke and pollution. If your lungs are damaged, you can get COPD or emphysema. AAT deficiency is sometimes known as genetic COPD or genetic emphysema. And when AAT builds up in your liver, the buildup may cause scarring, or cirrhosis, of your liver. You might not know you have the disease until you're an adult. Most people get their first symptoms between the ages of 20 and 50. Symptoms of AAT Deficiency When you have AAT deficiency, your lungs don't get enough of a protein they need to protect them. This can lead to COPD or emphysema. (Photo credit: Lisa F. Young/Dreamstime) Common symptoms of AAT deficiency include: Wheezing or whistling sounds when you breathe Having colds often Feeling tired A fast heartbeat when you stand up Weight loss If AAT deficiency affects your liver, you could have: Yellowish skin or eyes A swollen belly or legs Coughing up of blood A newborn baby might have: Yellowing of the skin or eyes (jaundice) Bright yellow urine Trouble gaining weight An enlarged liver Bleeding from the nose or umbilical stump Pale, smelly poop Low energy It's rare, but some people also get a skin disease called panniculitis. It is inflammation of the fat layer under your skin and causes hardening of the skin along with painful lumps or patches. How Alpha-1 Affects Your Liver Alpha-1 is a rare disease that makes an enzyme in your liver work poorly. Alpha-1 antitrypsin protein usually travels from your liver through your blood to protect your lungs and other organs. But if the proteins aren't the right shape, they can get stuck in your liver. This can cause cirrhosis , severe liver damage and scarring, and liver cancer . And because the proteins aren't traveling to your lungs like they should, it can also cause lung problems. AAT Testing First, your doctor will listen to your breathing with a stethoscope to check for wheezing or other signs that your lungs aren't working right. Blood tests. These will show the levels of AAT in your blood and measure your liver function. A special blood test called a blood gases test looks at the oxygen level in your arteries, a sign of how well your lungs work. Genetic testing: If your blood levels of AAT are low, these tests will find abnormal genes and see if any have a link to AAT. Imaging. X-rays and CT scans show where damage is in your lungs and how serious it is. Pulmonary function tests. You'll breathe into a machine that measures how well your lungs are working. Liver ultrasound or elastography. These tests will show if there are signs of scarring on your liver. Liver biopsy. A small sample of cells is taken using a very thin needle and checked for signs of damage. Questions for the Doctor It's important to ask your doctor any question you have about this condition. You might start with these: Have you treated other people with AAT deficiency? What treatments do you suggest? Is replacement therapy something that may be right for me? What are my chances of having COPD or emphysema? How will we know how I'm doing? Should my children be tested for this condition? Is it safe for me to exercise? What are some things I can do to manage my symptoms? Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency Treatment There's no cure for AAT deficiency. But you can protect yourself from more lung damage with a treatment called augmentation therapy, sometimes called replacement therapy. It works by raising the amount of AAT protein in your blood. You may also have this treatment if you get emphysema. With this treatment, you get a new supply of AAT protein from healthy human donors through an IV once a week. You can have this procedure at your doctor's office or at home with the help of a technician. Augmentation therapy can slow or stop the damage to your lungs, but it won't reverse the disease or heal any damage you already have. You'll need these treatments for the rest of your life. You may also get a bronchodilator, or medication to open your airways that you breathe into your lungs with an inhaler. If your breathing trouble leads to low levels of oxygen in your blood, you might need extra oxygen through a mask or nosepiece. Your doctor may also suggest that you go into pulmonary rehab, where you can learn breathing techniques and exercises, as well as how to make some everyday activities easier. Why Get Tested for Alpha-1? Though there's no cure for AAT deficiency, there are treatments to delay or prevent lung disease. It's also important to know if you can pass the genes on to family members. A healthy lifestyle--including a balanced diet, regular exercise, and not smoking--can help keep your lungs in the best possible shape. If you do develop lung disease, you can work with your doctor on a plan to help you manage symptoms and feel your best. Your Care Team for AAT Deficiency Your health care team is an important part of diagnosing and treating AAT deficiency. Here are some of the medical professionals you could visit for care: Pediatrician. You're more likely to get AAT deficiency as an adult, but kids get it, too. A pediatrician takes care of the general health of children and young adults, or they may specialize in certain health conditions. Geneticist. Since AAT deficiency is a genetic disease, your doctor may suggest genetic testing to precisely diagnose or help manage it. Geneticists and genetic counselors work with you and your regular doctor to include genetic information in your health care plan. Pulmonologist. These doctors diagnose and treat illnesses that affect your lungs, such as AAT deficiency. Gastroenterologist. AAT deficiency can also affect your liver, one of the organs that gastroenterologists focus on. These doctors mainly diagnose and treat diseases affecting your digestive tract. Pulmonary rehab team. Experts suggest pulmonary rehabilitation for people with AAT deficiency. This is a program of exercise, breathing techniques, education, nutrition, and more. It's designed to help people with pulmonary disease. Doctors, nurses, physical and respiratory therapists, exercise specialists, and dietitians could all be part of your rehab team. What to Expect With AAT Deficiency AAT deficiency is different for everyone. Some people have severe problems. Others may have few or no symptoms. Breathing issues. You'll be more sensitive to smoke, dust, and allergens like pollen. If you catch a cold, your symptoms may be stronger. You also might have chronic bronchitis, an irritation of your airways that causes coughing and affects breathing. COPD. AAT deficiency can cause chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). When you have COPD, you often have symptoms of emphysema, a serious condition that makes it hard for you to push air out of your lungs. COPD can make you wheeze and struggle to breathe. You may cough up mucus and feel tightness in your chest. Liver issues. About 30% to 40% of people with this condition will have liver problems at some point in their lives. While these health issues are possibilities, with treatment, you'll probably still be able to work, be active, and enjoy many of your favorite hobbies. In babies and children, the condition is more likely to cause liver damage than lung problems. Still, only about 10% of children with it have severe liver disease. Children with AAT deficiency also may have asthma. Treating Liver Problems If your liver is damaged, you can get treatment to help prevent or slow down the health problems this can cause. You can also get treatments to ease symptoms. These include: Vitamin supplements Medicines to ease itching or jaundice Treatments for bleeding and fluid in your belly If your liver damage is life-threatening or severe, you may need a liver transplant. How Your AAT Deficiency Might Change Over Time You could have the gene that causes AAT deficiency and never have symptoms or organ damage. This is especially true if you avoid smoking. Meanwhile, others with the illness have serious, even deadly health problems. Other conditions that can happen with AAT deficiency include: Lung conditions that get worse over time, like COPD Lasting airway damage (emphysema, bronchiectasis) High blood pressure that affects the arteries from your heart to your lungs (pulmonary hypertension) Liver scarring Liver cancer Heart, liver, or respiratory failure Inflammation of fat beneath the skin (panniculitis) Many people with AAT deficiency live a normal lifespan, especially if they don't smoke. Others may have serious complications. Your medical outlook depends on: Whether you're diagnosed promptly The type of Alpha-1 you have How the disease impacts you Your level of organ damage How strong your lungs are If your lung or liver disease is getting worse quickly or more slowly If you smoke The best thing you can do is follow guidance from your doctor to manage your condition. Tips for Living With AAT Deficiency Good habits are important to help you stay healthy with this condition. There are several things you can do to manage your symptoms: Stay away from things that can irritate your lungs, like smoke, dust, and pet hair. Steer clear of infections: Wash your hands often, and stay away from others who are sick. Pay attention to how you feel, and pace yourself if you need to. Take your medications as prescribed. Stay up to date on vaccines, including those for flu and COVID-19. Talk to your doctor about how to exercise safely. Limit how much alcohol you drink. If you don't drink, don't start. Don't smoke. If you need help to quit, talk to your doctor. Eat a healthful diet. Make daily tasks easier: Plan chores so you can cut down on climbing stairs, or use a rolling cart to move things from place to place. Get the support you need: Ask friends and family for help with tasks. Consider joining a support group to talk with others in a similar situation. If you have feelings of depression, talk to your doctor or a counselor about what treatments may help. Caring for Your Emotional and Mental Health Living with AAT deficiency can affect your emotional health. You're more likely to have feelings of anxiety and depression than someone who doesn't have it. It's important to be aware of how you feel and take steps to help yourself feel better. Let your doctor know how you feel. If your low mood persists, your care provider may suggest that you work with a counselor or therapist. They may also prescribe medications that can help. Take care of your health. Your physical health can affect your mood, so keep up with healthy habits: Get enough sleep, eat a healthy diet, and stay as active as you can with your doctor's OK. Watch your stress levels. Stress can affect how you breathe, so learn techniques that help you manage it. This can be things like breathing exercises, journaling, meditation, or just taking some ""you time."" Connect with support groups. It can help to talk to people who understand what you're going through. You can find names of doctors, links to support groups, genetic counseling resources, and other information from the Alpha-1 Foundation website. Ask for help when you need it. Whether it's taking over some chores for a while or giving a listening ear, support from your loved ones can make a big difference. Let loved ones know how they can help you when you're not feeling your best. The Future of Treatment While augmentation therapy works to slow or stop lung damage from AAT deficiency, it's only for people who are seriously ill. This means people with less severe symptoms often don't get treatment. Augmentation therapy is also expensive, and weekly treatments can be inconvenient. Also, it only treats lung disease, not liver disease that sometimes forms when you have AAT deficiency. Researchers are now looking into new options for people living with this lifelong disease. Here's a closer look at some of them: Recombinant AAT (rAAT) AAT can come from two sources: human plasma and through the use of recombinant technology. Scientists use this technology to create new proteins or change existing ones. In the future, it could be a more consistent and reliable source of AAT. But it's a newer technology and not approved to treat AAT deficiency. Inhaled AAT People with AAT deficiency have replacement therapy through an IV, which can be inconvenient and uncomfortable. Researchers are now studying an inhaler that delivers AAT directly to your lungs. They've found it may work even better than an IV, since most AAT-related damage happens in the lungs. Several studies have found AAT inhalers are safe and boost AAT levels in the lungs. Other emerging treatments Other treatments for AAT deficiency are in different stages of development. They include: Gene therapy. This involves replacing the faulty gene responsible for AAT deficiency with a healthy one. Research into gene therapy for AAT deficiency has been mixed. The results of one study showed the treatment is safe and worked to keep AAT levels in the normal range. But the results of another study showed lower AAT levels. Stem cell therapy. This treatment replaces damaged cells with healthy stem cells. The stem cells come from people with AAT, which scientists use to study and create treatments for the disease. Small molecule therapy. These are drugs that target specific molecules involved in disease. In AAT deficiency, they could help slow liver damage by stopping the protein from building up in liver cells. This type of therapy shows promise but needs more research."
12,Gilbert Syndrome,"What Is Gilbert’s Syndrome? Gilbert’s syndrome (also called constitutional hepatic dysfunction or familial nonhemolytic jaundice) is a common disorder that's passed through families. When you have it, too much of a waste product called bilirubin builds up in your blood . It can make your skin and eyes look yellow from time to time. Gilbert’s syndrome looks scarier than it is. It's a harmless condition that doesn't need to be treated. Gilbert’s Syndrome Causes and Risk Factors It happens when a gene called UGT1A1 changes, or mutates. This gene carries instructions for making a liver enzyme that helps break down and get rid of the bilirubin in your body. Parents pass UGT1A1 gene mutations to their children. You need two copies of the mutated gene -- one from each parent -- to get it. Even if you do have both genes, you might not have Gilbert’s syndrome. Gilbert’s syndrome is more common in men than in women. Gilbert’s Syndrome Symptoms Most people with Gilbert’s syndrome don't have symptoms. They have enough of the liver enzyme to control their bilirubin levels. When bilirubin does build up in the blood , it causes the skin and whites of the eyes to turn yellow. This is called jaundice . See your doctor if you notice a yellow color to your skin and eyes because another condition could be causing it. Jaundice can cause other symptoms such as: Nausea and diarrhea Abdominal discomfort Fatigue Dark urine Jaundice is a common problem in babies. But it’s worse in babies born with Gilbert’s syndrome. Certain things can make your bilirubin levels rise, but you might only notice jaundice when you: Are stressed Are dehydrated Exercise too much Have an infection like the flu Skip meals Drink alcohol Take medicines that affect your liver Are outside in cold weather Have your period Are recovering from surgery Gilbert’s Syndrome Diagnosis Although people are born with Gilbert’s syndrome, sometimes they don’t get diagnosed until their 20s or 30s. You may have a blood test for another reason and your doctor may notice you have high bilirubin levels, which may be a clue that you have the syndrome. They may do more tests to diagnose you, including: A liver ultrasound or liver function tests to rule out other problems Gene tests to see if you have the UGT1A1 gene mutation A liver biopsy (rarely done) Gilbert’s Syndrome Treatments and Home Remedies Most people with Gilbert’s syndrome don't need treatment. Jaundice doesn't cause any long-term problems. To prevent it, try to avoid things that make your bilirubin levels rise. For instance: Don't skip meals. Drink plenty of fluids. Use relaxation techniques or other methods to manage stress . Get a good night's sleep . Limit your alcoholic drinks. Skip long and strenuous workouts. The same liver enzyme that breaks down bilirubin also breaks down certain medicines, including: Acetaminophen Irinotecan ( Camptosar ), a cancer drug Protease inhibitor drugs used to treat HIV and hepatitis C Monoclonal antibodies used to treat autoimmune diseases If you have Gilbert’s syndrome and you take any of these drugs, you're at higher risk for side effects like diarrhea . Ask your doctor before you take any new medicine. And don't take more than the recommended dose."
13,Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension,"What Is Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension? Pulmonary hypertension is a life-threatening condition that gets worse over time, but treatments can help your symptoms so you can live better with the disease. It may take some planning, but plenty of people who have it find ways to do all the things they love, just as they did before they were diagnosed. Having pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) means that you have high blood pressure in the arteries that go from your heart to your lungs . It's different from having regular high blood pressure . With PAH, the tiny arteries in your lungs become narrow or blocked. It's harder for blood to flow through them, and that raises the blood pressure in your lungs. Your heart has to work harder to pump blood through those arteries, and after a while the heart muscle gets weak. Eventually, it can lead to heart failure. Causes Sometimes doctors can't find a reason for high blood pressure in the lungs. In that case, the condition is called idiopathic pulmonary hypertension. Genes may play a role in why some people get it. In other cases, there is another condition that's causing the problem. Any of these illnesses can lead to high blood pressure in your lungs: Congestive heart failure Blood clots in the lungs HIV Illegal drug use (like cocaine or methamphetamine ) Liver disease (such as cirrhosis of the liver ) Lupus, scleroderma , rheumatoid arthritis, and other autoimmune diseases A heart defect you're born with Lung diseases like emphysema , chronic bronchitis , or pulmonary fibrosis Sleep apnea Symptoms You may not notice any symptoms for a while. The main one is shortness of breath when you're active. It usually starts slowly and gets worse as time goes on. You may notice that you can't do some of the things you used to without getting winded. Other symptoms include: Chest pain Fatigue Passing out Swelling in your ankles and legs Getting a Diagnosis If you have shortness of breath and see your doctor, they will ask you about your medical history. They may also ask you: Do you smoke? Does anyone in your family have heart or lung disease? When did your symptoms start? What makes your symptoms better or worse? Do your symptoms ever go away? Your doctor may order tests, including: Echocardiogram : This ultrasound picture of the beating heart can check blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries. CT scan : This can show enlarged pulmonary arteries. A CT scan can also spot other problems in the lungs that could cause shortness of breath. Ventilation-perfusion scan (V/Q scan): This test can help find blood clots that can cause high blood pressure in the lungs. Electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG): An EKG traces the heart's activity and can show whether the right side of the heart is under strain. That's a warning sign of pulmonary hypertension. Chest X-ray: An X-ray can show if your arteries or heart are enlarged. Chest X-rays can help find other lung or heart conditions that may be causing the problems. Exercise testing: Your doctor may want you to run on a treadmill or ride a stationary bike while you are hooked up to a monitor, so they can see any changes in your oxygen levels, heart function, lung pressure, or other things. Your doctor may also do blood tests to check for HIV and conditions like rheumatoid arthritis or lupus . If these tests show that you might have pulmonary hypertension, your doctor will need to do a right heart catheterization to be sure. Here's what happens during that test: The doctor places a catheter into a large vein, most often the jugular vein in your neck or femoral vein in your leg, and then threads it into the right side of your heart. A monitor records the pressures in the right side of the heart and in the pulmonary arteries. The doctor may also inject medicines into the catheter to see if the pulmonary arteries are stiff. This is called a vasoreactivity test. Right heart catheterization is safe. The doctor will give you a sedative and use local anesthesia. You can usually go home the same day, although you will need someone to drive you home. Questions for Your Doctor You may want to write down a list of questions before your appointment, so you can make sure you ask your doctor everything you want to. It can also help to have a friend or family member with you to help you get the answers you want. Some possible questions are: What's the best treatment for me? How often should I see a doctor for my condition? Do I need to see a specialist? When should I go to the emergency room? Do I need to limit the salt or fluids in my diet? What kind of exercise can I do? Are there any activities I should stay away from? Should I get a pneumonia vaccine, a flu shot , and a COVID-19 vaccine ? Treatment Pulmonary hypertension varies from person to person, so your treatment plan will be specific to your needs. Ask your doctor what your options are and what to expect. First, your doctor will treat the cause of your condition. For example, if emphysema is causing the problem, you'll need to treat that to improve your pulmonary hypertension. Most people also get treatment to improve their breathing, which makes it easier to be active and do daily tasks. Oxygen therapy, when you breathe pure oxygen through prongs that fit in your nose, will help if you’re short of breath and have low oxygen levels in your blood. It helps you live longer when you have pulmonary hypertension. If you are at risk for blood clots your doctor will recommend blood thinners . Other medicines improve how well your heart works and keep fluid from building up in your body. If you have severe pulmonary hypertension, your doctor may prescribe medications called calcium channel blockers. These medicines lower blood pressure in the lungs and the rest of the body. If calcium channel blockers aren’t enough, your doctor may refer you to a specialized treatment center. You may need more targeted therapies that can open up your narrowed blood vessels. They may be pills, medicines you breathe in, or drugs that are given through an IV. Options include: Pills: ambrisentan ( Letairis ), bosentan ( Tracleer ), macitentan ( Opsumit ), riociguat ( Adempas ), selexipag ( Uptravi ), sildenafil ( Revatio ), tadalafil ( Adcirca ), treprostinil ( Orenitram ) Inhalers: Iloprost tromethamine ( Ventavis ), treprostinil ( Tyvaso ) IV drugs: epoprostenol sodium ( Flolan , Veletri ), treprostinil ( Remodulin ) In more severe cases, or if medicines don't help, your doctor may recommend a lung transplant or a procedure called atrial septostomy. A surgeon creates an opening between the right and left sides of the heart. This surgery can have serious side effects. Taking Care of Yourself One of the best things you can do for yourself is to stay active, even if you have shortness of breath. Regular exercise, like taking a walk, will help you breathe better and live better. Talk to your doctor first to find out what kind of exercise is best for you, and how much you should do. Some people may need to use oxygen when they exercise. Get plenty of rest, too. Pulmonary hypertension makes you tired, so get a good night's sleep and take naps when you need to. Just like anyone else, it's good for you to eat a healthy diet with lots of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. That's important for your overall health. What to Expect A lot depends on what's causing your pulmonary hypertension. Treating an underlying condition will help you feel better. There's no cure for pulmonary hypertension, but the earlier it's diagnosed, the easier it is to live with. If you have idiopathic pulmonary hypertension -- the kind where doctors can't find a cause -- your symptoms may get worse over time. But treatment can slow down the progress of the disease and help you live longer. Remember that each person is different, and there are good treatments available. Work with your doctor to find what's right for you. Where to Find More Information The Pulmonary Hypertension Association offers in-depth information on everything from medications to tips on making daily tasks easier. It also has an active online support community."
14,What Is Leukodystrophy?,"Leukodystrophy isn’t just one disease; it’s actually a group of diseases that affect the central nervous system. Doctors are discovering new forms of leukodystrophy all the time, but experts currently know of about 52 different kinds. Most of the leukodystrophies are genetic, meaning they’re passed down from parent to child. Sometimes symptoms will show up early in childhood. But because the diseases are progressive, meaning they get worse over time, some children born with a form of leukodystrophy may seem fine. Symptoms The one thing all leukodystrophies have in common is they cause abnormal development or destruction of the brain’s myelin sheath. That’s the white fatty matter that protects the brain’s nerves. Without it, your nervous system can’t function properly. But each leukodystrophy affects myelin differently. That means children can have many problems, including: Balance and mobility problems Behavioral and learning disabilities Bladder issues Breathing difficulties Developmental delays Hearing, speech, and vision problems Muscle control disorders Seizures For example, one type of leukodystrophy, Canavan disease, causes decreased muscle tone, especially in the neck, and abnormally straight legs and flexed arms. It can also include symptoms like blindness and seizures. Sometimes symptoms show up soon after a child is born, and sometimes as late as adulthood. Signs of Refsum Disease, for example, usually occur around age 20, but can be as late as age 50. Some of the common symptoms include degeneration of the retina in the eye, deafness, and loss of sense of smell. While every leukodystrophy is different, the most common problem is a child’s health gradually worsening in some way, even though they seemed fine to start with. This can be a worsening of their vision, hearing, speech, ability to eat, behavior, or thought. Since symptoms can vary so much, leukodystrophy can be hard to diagnose. Causes Most of the leukodystrophies are inherited, which means they’re passed down through family genes. Some may not be inherited, but are still caused by a genetic mutation. One child in your family could have leukodystrophy, and others might not. For example, Alexander disease doesn’t seem to be genetically inherited, so your child can have a defective gene even if neither you nor your partner have it. If you have a child with leukodystrophy and you’re planning to have more children, you may want to consider genetic counseling. It can help you understand your chances of having another child with leukodystrophy. Diagnosis Diagnosing leukodystrophy can be difficult. Oftentimes, doctors have to use several types of testing, including: Blood and urine analysis CT scans Genetic testing MRI scans Psychological and cognitive tests Treatment There is no cure for most kinds of leukodystrophy. Treating it depends on the type, and doctors address the symptoms of the disease with medications and special kinds of physical, occupational, and speech therapy. Some people may need additional help with learning or nutrition. In some cases, a bone marrow transplant can help by slowing or stopping the progression of the disease. Scientists are also researching whether gene therapy or replacing certain enzymes can help treat some kinds of leukodystrophy."
15,What Is Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva?,"There are important reasons why muscle is muscle and bone is bone. Sometimes you need flexibility and strength. Other times you need hardness and structure. In a rare condition called fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP), this system breaks down. Your body’s soft tissues -- muscles, ligaments, and tendons -- turn into bone and form a second skeleton outside your normal one. As bone takes over, it gets harder or even impossible to move different parts of your body, which affects everyday activities such as eating and talking. FOP often starts in early childhood. It begins around the shoulders and neck, then works its way down through the rest of the body. As you get older, bone replaces more and more of soft tissue, but how quickly that happens varies from person to person. What Causes FOP? A glitch in one of the genes that tells your body how to grow your bones and muscles causes the condition. It’s actually part of normal growth that some soft tissue turns into bone. But with this problem in your gene, bone grows too often and too much. In most cases, you don’t get FOP -- which is also known as myositis ossificans progressive -- from your parents. That happens sometimes, but more often, there’s a change in your genes during your lifetime that causes it. Signs and Symptoms One of the telltale signs is present at birth -- the big toe on each foot is shorter than it should be and is turned toward the other toes. About half the people with FOP also have a similar issue with their thumbs. The other main sign is bone replacing soft tissue. This usually starts with tumorlike growths on the back, neck, and shoulders. The growths are painful and soon turn into bone. These flare-ups repeat throughout your life and spread to the rest of your body. It’s not always the case, but very often, an injury or virus triggers a flare-up. This makes it especially hard for people to get any kind of surgery or even an injection before getting a cavity filled. FOP flare-ups typically last 6 to 8 weeks. They may cause pain and swelling, stiffness in the joints, all-around discomfort, and a low-grade fever. Complications The condition may cause chronic (ongoing) swelling nearly anywhere in your body. As bone replaces tissue, you lose the ability to move body parts, which makes it harder to: Breathe (your lungs can’t fully expand) Eat (making it harder to get the nutrients you need) Keep your balance Speak Walk or sit For some people, it also leads to curves in the spine , either from side to side or top to bottom. As your ability to move gets more limited, you’re more likely to get infections in your nose, throat, and lungs . You also have a higher chance of some types of heart failure (when muscles in the heart wall weaken and can’t pump enough blood to your body). Diagnosis Usually it's found during a physical exam when the doctor looks for the two main signs -- the short and inward-pointing toes and the tumorlike growths on the shoulders, back, and neck. Your doctor can make sure it’s FOP with a blood test that looks for the glitch in the gene that causes it. Doctors often mistake it for other conditions. This can be especially harmful to people with FOP because common tests such as a biopsy can trigger a flare-up. It’s most commonly mistaken for: Cancer Aggressive juvenile fibromatosis, also called desmoid tumors, which is a rare cancer in the tendons and ligaments Progressive osseous heteroplasia, another disease where bone forms outside the skeleton If you think your child has this condition, it can help to talk to a doctor who knows about it. Is There a Cure? There’s no cure, and treatment is limited. Medicine, such as corticosteroids, can provide relief from pain and inflammation during flare-ups. Also, an occupational therapist may be able to help with braces, shoes, and other tools to assist with day-to-day activities."
16,Uterine Fibroids,"What Are Uterine Fibroids? Uterine fibroids can cause symptoms ranging from mild to serious, including painful periods. Experts have a couple of ideas about why you may get them. (Photo Credit: iStock/Getty Images) Uterine fibroids , which your doctor may call leiomyomas or myomas, are tumors made of muscle that can grow on your uterus. They rarely turn into cancer . And if you get them, it doesn’t mean you’re more likely to get uterine cancer. Fibroids can vary a lot in size, shape, and location. They can show up in your uterus, uterine wall, or on its surface. They can also attach to your uterus by a stalk- or stem-like structure. Some are so small that your doctor can’t even see them with the naked eye . Others grow in big masses that can affect the size and shape of your uterus. Uterine fibroids usually appear when you're of childbearing age – generally between 30 and 40 years old – but they can show up at any age. They’re more common in Black people than in White people. They also tend to show up earlier and grow quicker in Black people. Doctors don’t know why. Uterine Fibroid vs. Polyp Although they have similar symptoms, uterine fibroids and polyps are different. Uterine polyps are smaller and grow from the lining of the uterus. They can eventually block the opening of your fallopian tubes and stop you from getting pregnant. A small number of polyps, around 5%, turn out to be cancerous or have abnormal cells that are more likely to turn into cancer. It's why most gynecologists suggest removing them. Treatments include medication, surgery, and watchful waiting to see if polyps get better on their own. Types of Fibroids The type of fibroids you have depends on where they grow or form. Intramural fibroid This type of fibroid grows within the wall of your uterus. Submucosal fibroids When a fibroid grows into your uterine cavity, doctors call it submucosal. Subserosal fibroid This type of fibroid happens on the outside of your uterus. At times, submucosal or subserosal fibroids may hang from a stalk inside or outside of your uterus (called pedunculated). Symptoms of Uterine Fibroids Fibroids may cause very mild symptoms, no symptoms at all, or symptoms that are serious. The most common symptoms of uterine fibroids include: Heavy, long, or painful periods Pain in the lower belly or back Painful sex Peeing often Discomfort in the rectum Causes of Uterine Fibroids Experts don’t know exactly why you get fibroids. Hormones and genetics might make you more likely to get them. Hormones . Estrogen and progesterone are the hormones that make the lining of your uterus thicken every month during your period. They also seem to affect fibroid growth. When hormone production slows down during menopause , fibroids usually shrink. Genetics . Researchers have found genetic differences between fibroids and normal cells in the uterus. Other growth factors. Substances in your body that help with tissue upkeep, such as insulin-like growth factor, may play a part in fibroid growth. Extracellular matrix (ECM). ECM makes your cells stick together. Fibroids have more ECM than normal cells, which makes them fibrous or ropey. ECM also stores growth factors (substances that spur cell growth) and causes cells to change. Uterine Fibroid Risk Factors A few things can raise your chances of getting uterine fibroids, such as: Age Race Getting your period at a young age Birth control pill use before age 16 Vitamin D deficiency Eating too much red meat and not enough green vegetables, fruit, or dairy Alcohol Family history You’re more likely to get fibroids if close relatives like your mom or sister have had them. Uterine Fibroid Diagnosis Your doctor may suspect you have uterine fibroids just from feeling your uterus during a routine pelvic exam. If the shape of your uterus feels irregular or unusually large, they may order further tests, such as: Ultrasound. Ultrasounds use sound waves to take a picture of your uterus. A technician will place a device either in your vagina or on your belly to get the images. Then your doctor can see if you have fibroids and where and how large they are. Lab tests. Your doctor may want you to have blood tests to help figure out why you have fibroids. Your complete blood count can help them decide whether you have anemia (low levels of red blood cells) or other bleeding disorders. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). If your doctor needs more information after you have an ultrasound, you may also have an MRI. MRIs show more detailed images of fibroids and can help doctors decide the best treatment. Your doctor may also suggest an MRI if you have a large uterus or are close to menopause. Hysterosonography. In this test, a technician pushes a small amount of saline solution into your uterine cavity to make it larger. This helps them see fibroids that are growing into your uterus (submucosal fibroids) and the lining of your uterus. This is useful if you’re trying to get pregnant or have heavy periods. Hysterosalpingography. If your doctor needs to see if your fallopian tubes are blocked, you might have a hysterosalpingography. Your doctor uses dye to highlight your uterus and fallopian tubes on an X-ray to see these areas better. Hysteroscopy. Your doctor inserts a small telescope with a light attached into your cervix. Then, after injecting saline and expanding your uterine cavity, they can look at the walls of your uterus and fallopian tube opening. Uterine Fibroid Treatment There are many ways to treat fibroids. The treatment that works best for you will depend on whether you’re having symptoms, want to get pregnant, your age, and where your fibroids are. Watchful waiting. If you have only mild symptoms – or no symptoms – your doctor may suggest you simply wait and see. Fibroids aren’t cancerous, and they may grow slowly or not at all. They also may shrink or go away after menopause. Medications. Medications for fibroids treat your symptoms. Fibroids won’t go away but might shrink with some medications. They can also help with symptoms like pain and bleeding. Birth control pills can reduce bleeding. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications such as ibuprofen or naproxen can ease pain. Vitamins and iron supplements can help with energy if you’re bleeding heavily and have anemia as a result. Other medications include: Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists put you in a temporary menopause state by blocking estrogen and progesterone. This may shrink your fibroids. You take them as shots. Your doctor may choose this option before you have surgery. GnRH antagonists work in a different way to reduce or stop your period. Oriahnn and Myfembree combine GnRH antagonists with estrogen and progestin. You take them as pills. A progestin-releasing intrauterine device (IUD) inserted into your uterus can help control heavy bleeding. It also prevents pregnancy. But it might not be right for you if you have fibroids in the cavity of your uterus. Tranexamic acid (Cyklokapron, Lysteda) is a medication that doesn’t involve hormones. You take it on days you’re bleeding heavily to slow your flow. Surgery. If you have moderate or severe symptoms, you may need surgery for relief. Options include: Myomectomy. This surgery takes out fibroids while trying to leave healthy tissue alone. This might be your best option if you hope to become pregnant in the future. There are multiple ways to do a myomectomy, from major abdominal surgery to laparoscopy (surgery done through one or more small cuts instead of one large one). Endometrial ablation. A surgeon uses either a laser, wire loops, boiling water, an electric current, microwaves, or freezing to remove or destroy the lining of your uterus. You may be able to have this minor surgery as an outpatient. Typically, you’ll stop having periods afterward, and you'll no longer be able to get pregnant. Uterine fibroid embolization (UFE), or uterine artery embolization (UAE). In this procedure, a doctor blocks the flow of blood to your fibroids by inserting gel or plastic particles into the nearby blood vessels. This makes the fibroids shrink. Hysterectomy. This surgery removes your uterus completely. This is the only way to cure fibroids entirely. It’s a major surgery, but your doctor has options for how to do it, including cutting through your belly or even laparoscopy. Uterine Fibroid Complications Most of the time, uterine fibroids aren't dangerous, but some people do have further health problems, such as anemia. Heavy blood loss and a drop in red blood cells cause the condition. Your doctor may suggest you take an iron supplement to avoid or manage anemia. People with severe anemia need donor blood (a transfusion). Which Size of Fibroid is Dangerous? Since most small fibroids don't cause symptoms, you probably won't need treatment. Instead, you and your doctor will keep an eye on your symptoms. Larger fibroids can cause serious health problems like severe pain and heavy bleeding. You'll need treatment based on your symptoms, the size of the fibroids, how many you have, and where they're located. Most fibroids are between 2 and 6 centimeters. Fibroids larger than this can cause heavy bleeding, and your doctor may face challenges in removing them. Uterine Fibroid Prevention Fibroids can’t be prevented, but research suggests certain lifestyle habits can reduce your chances of having them. One study found that high-sugar diets may be linked to a higher risk in some people. Another study found that eating fresh fruits and cruciferous vegetables like arugula, broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, collard greens, and turnip greens could lower your odds. Cruciferous vegetables are rich in beta carotene, folate, vitamins C, E, and K, and other minerals. They’re also full of fiber. Regular exercise also can lower your chances of getting uterine fibroids. Uterine Fibroids and Pregnancy Most people with uterine fibroids don't have trouble getting pregnant, but some fibroids can cause infertility or the loss of a pregnancy. If you're pregnant, the condition also raises the odds of health problems with your baby, such as being born too early and restricted growth. Uterine Fibroids After Menopause A drop in hormone levels after menopause tends to help shrink uterine fibroids, and you may notice your symptoms get better. Can fibroids still grow after menopause? It's unusual for uterine fibroids to keep growing after menopause. Talk to your doctor about any concerning fibroid symptoms after menopause, as they could be a sign of another health problem. Takeaways Uterine fibroids are noncancerous tumors made of muscle that can grow on the uterus. They vary in size, shape, and location, with symptoms including heavy periods, lower belly or back pain, painful sex, and peeing too often. We don't know the exact cause of the condition, but hormones, genetics, and other factors may lead to it. Treatment options range from watchful waiting for mild symptoms to medications and surgery for more severe cases. Lifestyle habits such as a healthy diet and regular exercise may lower your chances of getting uterine fibroids."
17,What Is Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis?,"Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a disease that affects your bile ducts. Bile is a digestive fluid your Liver makes. The ducts let it flow from your liver to your gallbladder and finally to your small intestine. There it helps break down fat from food. With PSC, your bile ducts become inflamed. This causes scars to form that block bile from traveling through them. As a result, it builds up inside your liver and damages your liver cells. It also causes scar tissue to form in your liver. Over time, the scar tissue affects your liver's ability to work the way it should and can lead to cirrhosis and eventually liver failure . PSC can happen at any age. But it's more common in adults than in kids and affects more men than women. About 70% of people with PSC are male. Symptoms PSC develops slowly. You may have it for years before you notice any symptoms. Some of the signs are: Fatigue Itchy skin Yellowish skin and eyes caused by a condition called jaundice As PSC worsens, your bile ducts may become infected. This can lead to fever , chills, and pain in your belly. Causes Doctors aren't sure what causes PSC. It may be a virus, bacteria, genes, or problems with your immune system. It's linked to inflammatory bowel disease, primarily ulcerative colitis and, less often, Crohn's disease . About 75% of people with PSC have ulcerative colitis. Doctors don't know how or why these conditions are connected. Diagnosis Your doctor will want to take a sample of your blood to check the levels of your liver enzymes . Unusual levels of certain enzymes could be a sign that you have PSC. To confirm it, you'll have an imaging test called cholangiography to give your doctor a closer look at your bile ducts. There are several different types of cholangiography: Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP).This uses powerful magnets and radio waves to make detailed images of your bile ducts. It's often a doctor's first choice because it's safe, painless, and non-invasive. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Before the test, you'll receive a sedative so you stay calm and comfortable. Your doctor will put a long, flexible tube called an endoscope through your mouth and into your digestive tract. They'll put dye into your bile ducts and take an X-ray. The dye helps your bile ducts show up more clearly. Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC). Your doctor puts a needle through your skin, places a thin tube into a duct in your liver, and puts dye through it. They then take an X-ray. Treatment No medications have been shown to help with PSC, but researchers are working on this. You may want to ask your doctor if you qualify for any drug therapy trials. These test medicines that aren't yet approved to treat PSC, and they may help with your symptoms or help control liver damage. If you have an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, your doctor may use special instruments through the endoscope to open blocked bile ducts. Otherwise, the goal is to help your symptoms and control complications that can occur. For example, your doctor may prescribe medications to ease itching, antibiotics to control an infection, or vitamin supplements to help with any deficiencies. If you have liver failure, you may need a liver transplant . Most people with PSC who have one have very good outcomes and quality of life afterward."
18,What Is Peyronie's Disease?,"Peyronie's disease is penis problem caused by scar tissue, called plaque, that forms inside the penis . It can result in a bent, rather than straight, erect penis. Most men with Peyronie's disease can still have sex. But for some, it can be painful and cause erectile dysfunction. Depending on the symptoms,  you may opt for observation, medical or surgical treatments. What Causes Peyronie's Disease? Doctors don’t know exactly why Peyronie's disease happens. Many researchers believe the fibrous plaque can start after trauma (hitting or bending) that causes bleeding inside the penis. You might not notice the injury or trauma. Other cases, which develop over time, may be linked to genes. In some men, injury, and genes could both be involved. Some medications list Peyronie's disease as a possible side effect. But there is no proof that these drugs cause the condition. Who Gets Peyronie's Disease? Although it mostly happens in middle-aged men, younger and older men can get it. It becomes more common as a man gets older. But it’s not a normal part of aging. What Are the Symptoms of Peyronie's Disease? Symptoms may develop slowly or appear overnight. When the penis is soft, you can’t see a problem. But in severe cases, the hardened plaque hampers flexibility, causing pain and forcing the penis to bend or arc when erect. In most cases, the pain eases over time, but the bend in the penis can worsen. Some men with the condition develop scar tissue elsewhere in the body, such as on the hand or foot. Men with Dupuytren's contractures -- scarring in the hand that affects fingers -- seem to be more likely to get Peyronie's. How Do Doctors Diagnose Peyronie's Disease? Tell your doctor about anything, such as an injury, that happened before the symptoms started. You’ll get an exam in which your doctor will feel the hardened tissue caused by the disease during an exam. It’s not always necessary, but if the penis has to be erect for the exam, the doctor would inject a medicine to make that happen. There’s a chance you may need to get an X-ray or ultrasound of the penis. It’s rare, but in some cases where the doctor's exam does not confirm Peyronie's disease, or if the condition develops rapidly, your doctor may do a biopsy . That involves removing a little bit of tissue from the affected area for lab tests. Can Peyronie's Disease Be Treated? Yes, but you might not need it. Since the condition improves without treatment in some men, doctors often suggest waiting 1 to 2 years or longer before they try to correct it. Mild cases of the condition rarely need treatment. Also, the pain that comes from Peyronie's disease happens only with an erection and is usually mild. If it’s not causing a problem with your sex life, treatment may not be necessary. What Treatments Are Available? If you need treatment, your doctor will consider surgery or medicine. First, your doctor will probably prescribe a pill, such as pentoxifylline or potassium para-aminobenzoate ( Potaba ). If those don’t work, you may get a shot of verapamil or collagenase ( Xiaflex ) into the scar tissue of the penis. If nothing else works, your doctor may consider surgery, but usually only for men who can’t have sex because of their Peyronie’s disease. The two most common operations are: Remove the plaque and get a tissue graft in its place. Remove or alter the tissue on the side of the penis opposite the plaque, which counters the disease's bending effect. Unfortunately, these procedures aren’t a sure solution. With the first method, you could have some erection problems. The second method, which doctors call the Nesbit procedure, shortens the erect penis. In some cases, it may be an option to get a penile prosthesis implanted. This treatment is only for men who have both Peyronie's disease and ED (erectile dysfunction). In some cases, extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) may be beneficial in softening a reducing the plaque. Most types of surgery help. But because of the possibility of complications that can’t be corrected, most doctors prefer to operate only on the small number of men with curvature so severe that it prevents sex. Do Vitamins Help? There have been mixed results on studies of vitamin E and with potassium aminobenzoate, which is related to the B vitamins . They aren’t proven cures. Other Options Other ways to treat Peyronie's disease that are unproven include injecting chemicals directly into the plaque and radiation therapy . But because radiation therapy can only relieve pain associated with Peyronie's disease and pain often stops without treatment, it’s rarely done. Pain Management In most men who have penile pain due to Peyronie's disease, the discomfort usually will fade on its own as the penile inflammation subsides. This process may take as long as 6 to 18 months."
19,Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD),"What Is Interstitial Lung Disease? Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a group of many lung conditions. All interstitial lung diseases affect the interstitium, a part of your lungs . The interstitium is a lace-like network of tissue that goes throughout both lungs . It supports your lungs' tiny air sacs, called alveoli. Normally, the interstitium is so thin that it doesn’t show up on X-rays or CT scans. Types of Interstitial Lung Disease All forms of interstitial lung disease cause the interstitium to thicken. This can happen from inflammation , scarring, or a buildup of fluid. Some forms of ILD last a short time (acute); others are long-term (chronic) and don’t go away. Some types of interstitial lung disease include: Interstitial pneumonia . Bacteria, viruses, or fungi can infect the interstitium. A bacteria called Mycoplasma pneumoniae is the most common cause. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis . This makes scar tissue grow in the interstitium.  Experts don’t know what causes it. Nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis. This is an interstitial lung disease that often affects people with autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis or scleroderma . Hypersensitivity pneumonitis . This happens when dust, mold , or other things that you breathe irritate your lungs over a long time. Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP). COP is a pneumonia-like interstitial lung disease without an infection. You might hear your doctor call this bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia (BOOP). Acute interstitial pneumonitis. This is a sudden, severe interstitial lung disease. People who have it often need to be connected to a machine called a ventilator that breathes for them. Desquamative interstitial pneumonitis. This is an interstitial lung disease that partly results from smoking . Sarcoidosis . This causes interstitial lung disease along with swollen lymph nodes . It can also affect your heart , skin , nerves, and eyes . Asbestosis. This is an interstitial lung disease caused by breathing asbestos, a fiber used in building materials. Interstitial Lung Disease Symptoms The most common symptom of all forms of interstitial lung disease is shortness of breath. Almost everyone with ILD will have breathlessness, which can get worse over time. Other symptoms of interstitial lung disease include: Cough , which is usually dry and doesn’t bring up mucus. Weight loss , most often in people with COP or BOOP. With most forms of ILD, shortness of breath develops slowly (over months). If you have interstitial pneumonia or acute interstitial pneumonitis, your symptoms will come on quickly (in hours or days). Interstitial Lung Disease Causes and Risks The cause of most interstitial lung disease is unknown. Bacteria, viruses, and fungi can cause interstitial pneumonia. You can also get ILD if you regularly breathe in things that can bother your lungs. These include: Asbestos Bird proteins (such as from exotic birds, chickens, or pigeons) Coal dust or various other metal dusts from working in mining Grain dust from farming Silica dust Talc It’s rare, but certain drugs can cause ILD: Some antibiotics, like nitrofurantoin Some anti-inflammatory drugs, like rituximab Chemotherapy drugs like bleomycin Heart medications such as amiodarone Anyone can get interstitial lung disease, but some things can put you at higher risk: Age. Adults are much more likely to get ILD, but children can, too. Autoimmune disease like lupus , rheumatoid arthritis , and scleroderma Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) Genetics. Some conditions are passed down among family members. Smoking Radiation treatments for cancer Interstitial Lung Disease Diagnosis People with interstitial lung disease usually go to the doctor because of shortness of breath or a cough . Your doctor will probably use imaging tests of your lungs to find out the problem. Chest X-ray. A simple chest X-ray is the first test for most people with a breathing problem. Chest X-rays in people with interstitial lung disease may show fine lines in the lungs. CT scan . A CT scan takes multiple X-rays of the chest, and a computer creates detailed images of the lungs and surrounding structures. These tests can usually find interstitial lung disease. High-resolution CT scan. If your doctor thinks you have an interstitial lung disease, certain CT scan settings can get better-quality images of your interstitium. This can help your doctor diagnose you. Lung function test. You sit in a sealed plastic booth and breathe through a tube to measure your total lung capacity, which might be reduced if you have ILD. You may also be less able to transfer oxygen from your lungs into your blood. Lung biopsy . Looking at lung tissue under a microscope is often the only way for a doctor to know which type of interstitial lung disease you have. Lung tissue is collected in a procedure called a lung biopsy, which can be done several ways: Bronchoscopy . Your doctor will run a tube called an endoscope through your mouth or nose and into your airways. Tiny tools on the endoscope can take a sample of lung tissue. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). Your doctor will make small cuts to insert tools that take samples from multiple areas of lung tissue. Open lung biopsy ( thoracotomy ). In some cases, you might need traditional surgery with a large incision in the chest to get a lung biopsy. Treatments for Interstitial Lung Disease The treatment you get depends on the type of ILD you have and its cause. Antibiotics . These treat most interstitial pneumonias. Pneumonias caused by a virus usually get better on their own. Pneumonias caused by a fungus are rare but are treated with antifungal drugs. Corticosteroids. In some forms of interstitial lung disease, inflammation in your lungs causes damage and scarring. Corticosteroids cause your immune system’s activity to slow. This lessens the amount of inflammation in your lungs and the rest of your body. Inhaled oxygen. If you have low oxygen levels because of interstitial lung disease, inhaled oxygen may help your symptoms. Regular use of oxygen might also protect your heart from damage caused by low oxygen levels. Lung transplant . In advanced interstitial lung disease that has severely impaired you, you may need a lung transplant. Most people who have a lung transplant for interstitial lung disease make large gains in their quality of life and their ability to exercise. Azathioprine (Imuran). This drug also slows down the immune system. It’s not shown to improve interstitial lung disease, but some studies suggest it might help. N- acetylcysteine (Mucomyst). This potent antioxidant may slow the decline of lung function in some forms of interstitial lung disease. You’ll take it in combination with other treatments. Other drugs are considered controversial for interstitial lung disease treatment, including: Cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) Cyclosporine Methotrexate Nintedanib (Ofev) Pirfenidone (Esbriet) These medicines affect the way your immune system works. If your doctor thinks you need one, they’ll keep a close watch on you while you’re taking it. These medications can have serious side effects. Interstitial Lung Disease Complications The complications of severe interstitial lung disease can be life threatening: High blood pressure in your lungs, known as pulmonary hypertension Respiratory failure Right-sided heart failure, known as cor pulmonale"
20,"Leptospirosis: Symptoms, Causes, and Treatment","What Is Leptospirosis? Leptospirosis can cause a range of flu-like symptoms, from vomiting to diarrhea. Learn what causes the rare infection and how to avoid it. (Photo Credit: iStock/Getty Images) Leptospirosis is a rare bacterial infection we get from animals. It’s spread through their urine , especially from dogs, rodents, and farm animals. They may not have any symptoms, but they can be carriers. In most cases, leptospirosis is unpleasant but not life-threatening, like a case of the flu . It rarely lasts more than a week. But about 10% of the time, when you have a severe form of leptospirosis, you’ll get better, but then get sick again. This is called Weil’s disease, and it can cause much more serious issues, like chest pain and swollen arms and legs. It often means a trip to the hospital. Leptospirosis Causes A bacteria called Leptospira interrogans causes leptospirosis. Many animals carry the organism, and it lives in their kidneys . It gets into soil and water from their urine. If you’re around soil or water where an infected animal has peed, the germ can invade your body through breaks in your skin , like scratches, open wounds, or dry areas. It can also enter through your nose, mouth , or genitals. It’s hard to get it from another person, though it can be passed through sex or breastfeeding . You have a higher chance of getting the disease if you spend a lot of time around animals or outdoors. You’re more likely to be exposed to it if you have one of these jobs: Farmer Veterinarian Underground worker (you work in a sewer or a mine) Slaughterhouse worker Military personnel Also, if you raft, swim, or camp near affected lakes and rivers, you could get the disease. You'll find leptospirosis more often in warm climates. And although the bacteria lives all over the world, it’s especially common in Australia, Africa, Southeast Asia, Central and South America, and the Caribbean. Leptospirosis Phases There are two phases of leptospirosis: Leptospiremic phase. During this phase, you'll suddenly have symptoms that feel a lot like the flu. They'll start a couple of days to a couple of weeks after you're first exposed to the leptospira bacteria. Symptoms can last for up to 10 days. Immune phase . Once you reach this phase, the leptospira bacteria is now in your organs, especially your kidneys. The bacteria will show up in urine tests, and your body will build up protection (antibodies) against the bacteria. It's possible that you could get sick during this phase with another illness called Weil's syndrome, which causes internal bleeding, kidney damage, and jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes). Leptospirosis Symptoms You usually start showing signs of leptospirosis within 2 weeks, though in some cases, symptoms may not show up for a month or not at all. When the disease does hit, it hits fast. You’ll get a fever . It may spike to 104 F. Other typical symptoms include: Headache Muscle ache Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes ) Vomiting Diarrhea Skin rash Many of these symptoms are similar to symptoms of other diseases, including the flu and meningitis , so it’s important to get tested. Leptospirosis Diagnosis To check for leptospirosis, your doctor does a simple blood test and examines your blood for antibodies . These are proteins your body produces to fight the bacteria. If you've had the disease in your system before, the blood test may give a false positive (or show antibodies from the previous infection). So your doctor will likely do a second test about a week later to make sure the results are correct. You may also have a urine test to look for signs of the bacteria. Your doctor could order a DNA test . It’s more precise, but it's more expensive and takes longer, and in many areas of the world, it’s not available yet. Doctors can also spot the bacteria if it grows in a blood, spinal fluid, or urine culture. Severe symptoms of leptospirosis may need a chest X-ray, CT scan, or other imaging. These tests will help show damage to your organs caused by the bacteria. Leptospirosis Treatment Doctors can treat leptospirosis with antibiotics, including penicillin and doxycycline. Your doctor may also suggest ibuprofen for fever and muscle pain. The disease should run its course in about a week. But you may have to go to the hospital if your infection is more serious. Symptoms may include kidney failure, meningitis, and lung problems. You may need a shot of antibiotics, and in very serious cases, the infection could damage your organs. You could also need treatment for other health problems. For example, the disease can spread through your body (systemic inflammatory syndrome) and cause internal bleeding and inflame your pancreas or gallbladder. You or those around you might notice changes in your speech or behavior after the spread of this infection. It also could inflame your heart muscle (myocarditis), leading to symptoms of heart failure, including blockages and an irregular heartbeat (dysrhythmia). Your doctor will consider your other symptoms, overall health, health history, age, and other things before deciding how to treat these health problems. Leptospirosis Prevention Avoid unsafe water. If you’re in a developing country, don’t drink the water unless you’re sure it’s clean. But because leptospirosis can enter through other body openings, it’s also a good idea to avoid swimming, waterskiing, sailing, or fishing in freshwater areas. Saltwater is generally safe. Keep away from infected animals, especially wild rats. Rats and other rodents are the main carriers of the bacteria. Be careful if you have to handle wild rats or come in contact with their habitats. In the developed world, farm animals are usually vaccinated, so there’s much less risk. If an animal is ill, avoid bites and body fluids. The disease can’t be passed through the air like a cold or the flu. Be aware of your surroundings, especially when you travel. In countries with poor sanitation, leptospirosis is more common and may be hard to avoid. So, know the symptoms and get help if you become ill. Use disinfectant. Bleach, Lysol, acid solutions, and iodine are deadly to the bacteria. Keep them on hand to clean up. Leptospirosis in Dogs All animals can get leptospirosis. Though it used to be rare in pets, it has shown up more often in the past few years, especially in dogs. (Leptospirosis is rare in cats.) Leptospirosis in dogs happens the same way it does in people: through contact with the urine of infected animals, which can get into water or soil and survive for weeks or months. Your pet might not show any symptoms. Many of the symptoms of leptospirosis are very similar to those of other diseases, such as: Fever Belly pain, vomiting, diarrhea Weakness Pain Stiffness The only way to know for sure they have it is to ask your vet to do a test. And of course, if your pet is infected, they can pass it on to you. There is a leptospirosis vaccine available for dogs. Veterinarians recommend that any dog that goes outside at all – even just to go to the bathroom – be vaccinated against leptospirosis."
21,Fifth Disease,"What Is Fifth Disease? Fifth disease, or erythema infectiosum, is a contagious viral infection common among school-age children. It’s most common during late winter, spring, and early summer. About 50% of adults are immune to fifth disease because they had it in childhood, often without knowing it. There is no vaccine for it. Fifth disease got its name many years ago when it was the fifth on a list of the six recognized childhood rash-forming illnesses. The others are rubella, measles, scarlet fever, chickenpox, and roseola infantum. Fifth Disease Symptoms In children, symptoms of fifth disease often start out like a cold. Then, within 7 to 10 days, a rash usually develops. Common symptoms of fifth disease include: Mild fever Stuffy or runny nose Headache Bright red cheeks A flat or raised red rash, usually on the arms and legs, which lasts from 2 to 39 days and may itch; the rash fades from the center of the red areas toward the edges, giving it a lacy appearance. The rash can recur with exercise, warm baths, rubbing the skin, or emotional upset. The most recognized sign of fifth disease is the red rash across the cheeks that looks as if the child has been slapped. You might also hear it called slapped-cheek disease. But not all children with fifth disease get the rash. It’s less common, but some kids also have: Sore throat Joint pain Swollen glands Red eyes Diarrhea Rash that looks like bruises or blisters The disease is rare in infants and adults. Adults usually don’t get a rash, but they do tend to get more serious flu-like symptoms, including: Headache Sore throat Muscle pain Joint pain, particularly in the hands, wrists, knees, and ankles Belly pain Fever Fifth Disease Causes Fifth disease is caused by parvovirus B19. This parvovirus only infects humans. Other forms of the virus can infect dogs and cats. Fifth Disease Transmission Fifth disease is spread through blood and by respiratory droplets that enter the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Adults who work with young children – such as child care providers, teachers, and health care workers – are most likely to be exposed. By the time the rash appears, children are no longer contagious and may attend school or day care. The incubation period (the time between infection and signs or symptoms of illness) is usually 4-14 days, but it can be as long as 21 days. Fifth Disease Prevention To limit the spread of fifth disease among children at home or in a child care setting, take the following steps: Wash hands often, especially after wiping or blowing noses and before preparing or eating food. Don't share food, pacifiers, bottles, eating utensils, or drinking cups. If toys tend to end up in tots' mouths, clean and disinfect them often. Don't kiss children on the mouth. Play outdoors as much as possible. It's easier for the virus to spread indoors where people are likely to be in closer contact. Make sure kids are not crowded together, especially during nap time. Teach children to cough or sneeze into a tissue (which should be thrown out right away) or the inside of their elbow (which is less likely than their hands to spread the virus) and away from other people. Children with fifth disease generally don't need to be excluded from day care , as they're unlikely to be contagious after the rash appears and a diagnosis has been made. Pregnancy and fifth disease If you don't have immunity to fifth disease and are pregnant, take steps to avoid infection. For instance, if there's an outbreak of fifth disease in your workplace, discuss with your doctor whether to stay home from work until it subsides. At home, wash your hands thoroughly after touching tissues used by infected children and dispose of these tissues promptly. Avoid sharing drinking glasses or utensils with anyone who has the illness or was exposed to it. Some doctors recommend giving immunoglobulin if you're pregnant and have been exposed to the virus. Fifth Disease Diagnosis In most cases, fifth disease is diagnosed based on the appearance of typical symptoms. A blood test can confirm whether you have fifth disease, but this usually is not necessary if you have a healthy immune system. If you're pregnant and you've been exposed to fifth disease, you may be given a blood test to determine whether you had it in the past and are, therefore, immune. If you get fifth disease while you're pregnant, either an amniocentesis or a test called percutaneous umbilical blood sampling (PUBS) can be used to test for the virus in your baby and find out how severe fetal anemia is, if it exists. Fifth disease can affect how your body or your baby's body makes red blood cells and cause severe anemia, although this is rare. Ultrasound can look for complications in your unborn baby, such as abnormal pooling of fluid around the heart, lungs, or belly. But most of the time, fifth disease doesn't cause your baby any problems. Fifth Disease Treatment The goal of fifth disease treatment is to ease symptoms and make you or your child more comfortable. There’s no specific medicine to treat the virus that causes fifth disease. Your doctor might suggest: Acetaminophen to help lower fever Ibuprofen for joint or muscle pain Antihistamines to treat itching that may come with the rash If you have sickle cell anemia, chronic anemia, or an impaired immune system, you can get a shot of immunoglobulin to fight off the virus. You may also need transfusions of red blood cells. Fifth Disease Complications Fifth disease is usually mild for otherwise healthy kids and adults and poses little risk to health. But it can cause chronic anemia in some people. You could need a blood transfusion, which would require a hospital stay. You’re more likely to have serious complications from fifth disease if you have a weakened immune system. Conditions that can weaken your immune system include leukemia and other cancers, HIV infection, and organ transplants. If you’re pregnant and think you may have the virus, call your doctor. Babies in utero don’t usually get the virus if their mother has it, and it hasn’t been shown to cause birth defects. But if a fetus does become infected, the virus can make it less able to produce red blood cells, leading to a dangerous form of anemia, heart failure, and sometimes miscarriage or stillbirth. A woman who gets the virus while pregnant has about a 2% chance of miscarriage. When to Call Your Doctor About Fifth Disease You should make that call to your doctor when: Your child has sickle cell anemia, any other chronic anemia or an impaired immune system and has been exposed to fifth disease or is showing symptoms. You're pregnant, you don't know whether you're immune to parvovirus B19 (or know that you are not immune), and you come into contact with anyone who has an infection with parvovirus B19. The rash becomes purple, painful, blistered, or lasts longer than 5 weeks. Your infected child looks or acts very ill."
22,Fine Needle Aspiration,"Fine needle aspiration is a type of biopsy procedure. In fine needle aspiration, a thin needle is inserted into an area of abnormal-appearing tissue or body fluid. As with other types of biopsies, the sample collected during fine needle aspiration can help make a diagnosis or rule out conditions such as cancer . Fine needle aspiration is generally considered a safe procedure. Complications are infrequent. Fine Needle Aspiration: When It's Used A fine needle aspiration is most often done on swellings or lumps located just under the skin . A lump may be felt during a doctor's examination. Or it may be discovered on an imaging test such as: CT scan mammogram ultrasound Imaging tests may also discover abnormal spots deeper inside the body. Doctors may recommend fine needle aspiration for areas such as: cysts (fluid-filled lumps) nodules or masses (solid lumps) enlarged lymph nodes Without a biopsy, it's usually hard for a doctor to confirm what these abnormal areas contain. And you may not know if they are a threat to your health. The most common reason to get a fine needle aspiration is to test for cancer. Most fine needle aspirations are done on these areas: breast thyroid gland lymph nodes in the neck, groin, or armpit Those types of fine needle aspirations are performed through the skin. Using endoscopy, doctors can also reach areas deeper in the body. An endoscopy uses a flexible tube with a light and camera attached. During an endoscopy, a doctor can do a fine needle aspiration on certain abnormal spots in the chest or abdomen . What to Expect Before Fine Needle Aspiration There is no one standard preparation before fine needle aspiration. You may be asked to take these preparations: Changes in medicines. Several days before the test, stop taking aspirin or other blood thinners. These include clopidogrel ( Plavix ), warfarin (Coumadin or Jantoven), or one of the newer direct oral anticoagulants, such as apixaban (Eliquis) and dabigatran (Pradaxa). Changes in diet. Do not eat or drink anything for several hours before the procedure. If you will be getting sedating medication, be sure to bring someone with you to drive you home. What to Expect During Fine Needle Aspiration Most fine needle aspirations are outpatient procedures. For people undergoing fine needle aspiration through the skin, here's what to expect: Your skin over the area of the procedure will be cleaned with antiseptic solution. It will then be covered with a sterile drape or towels. The area may be injected with a numbing medication under your skin. Ultrasound may be used during the procedure. This will help locate the right area for fine needle aspiration. A thin needle attached to a syringe will be inserted through the skin into the abnormal area. A vacuum inside the syringe causes body fluid or tissue to be suctioned (aspirated) into the needle and syringe. The fine needle aspiration itself is usually a short procedure (less than 10 minutes). The biopsy sample may be examined under a microscope right away. This will let your doctor: Verify that a good sample was obtained Make a rapid diagnosis Or, the biopsy sample may be sent to a lab for further testing. People undergoing fine needle aspiration during endoscopy will have additional preparation. Most will receive sedating medications. Endoscopic procedures usually take longer than fine needle aspirations through the skin (typically up to an hour). What to Expect After Fine Needle Aspiration If sedating medication is used during fine needle aspiration, you may be groggy and unable to work afterward. At the biopsy site, you may have some: swelling soreness pain In most people, over-the-counter pain medicines are enough to decrease discomfort. Examples include the generic drug acetaminophen . It is also sold under these brand names: Actamin Panadol Tylenol Final results of testing after a fine needle aspiration can take up to a week or longer. Preliminary results may be available sooner. Complications of Fine Needle Aspiration Serious complications after fine needle aspiration are rare. Minor bleeding under the skin at the biopsy site can occur. This can result in a tender, swollen area called a hematoma. Infection at the biopsy site is rare, because sterile techniques and equipment are used for all fine needle aspirations. The risk of complications from fine needle aspiration during endoscopy is slightly higher. But it is still quite low for most people."
23,Pros and Cons of Using a Pacifier,"For many parents, a pacifier tops the list of must-have items for a new baby. Babies naturally have the desire to suck, since it's the motion they use for nursing or taking a bottle. A pacifier does exactly what the name implies – it serves to pacify and comfort your baby. But how much should your baby depend on a pacifier – and is it safe at all? Here’s a breakdown of the pros and cons of pacifiers and their safety concerns. Pros of Using a Pacifier Pacifiers are popular for a few reasons. They: Offer comfort. Everything is new to your baby, and that can overwhelm them at times. A pacifier offers your baby the chance to suckle, one of the first self-soothing tools they may learn. Help with feeding. Premature babies (those born before their due date) need oral stimulation to help improve breastfeeding and bottle feeding skills. Giving a pacifier to babies who aren't yet breastfeeding or bottle feeding benefits their development. Lower the chance of SIDS. SIDS (sudden infant death syndrome) is the leading cause of death in babies under 1 year of age. Studies have shown that using a pacifier reduces the risk of SIDS during sleep. Help your baby fall asleep. While a pacifier may not improve the quality of your baby's sleep, it may help them fall asleep faster. Whether bottle-fed or breastfed, your baby has a natural desire to suck. Breastfeeding infants often want to nurse when falling asleep because it's comforting. Offering a pacifier may allow you to lay your baby down to fall asleep alone without rocking or nursing for comfort. If your baby’s pacifier falls out during sleep, you don’t have to put it back in their mouth unless they wake up crying for it. Ease pain. Pacifiers can help soothe pain for your baby during minor procedures such as having blood drawn. One study of babies who had their blood drawn found that they had less pain while sucking a pacifier vs. drinking a sugary drink. Can be a short-term habit. Unlike thumb sucking, sucking on a pacifier is an easier habit to break. Cons of Using a Pacifier While a pacifier offers your baby some much needed comfort, there are some downsides to relying on one: Nipple confusion. If you choose to breastfeed, it's important to wait to introduce a pacifier until nursing is well established. Your baby uses a different suckling technique when using a pacifier or bottle vs. nursing at the breast. Suckling on the pacifier is much easier than breastfeeding, which requires more effort and a particular technique to draw milk from the breast. If you introduce a pacifier too soon, your baby may turn away from nursing because of the effort it requires. Habit-forming. Your baby may grow to rely on the pacifier to stay asleep. If it falls out of their mouth in the middle of the night, they may wake up crying. You might get less sleep because you keep getting up to give your baby the pacifier. Dental development. Most babies don’t have teeth yet, but the use of a pacifier can impact the spacing and straightness of their teeth once they do begin to come in. If you can, plan for your baby to stop using a pacifier before it has too much of an impact on their teeth. While some babies are born with their first teeth, most start teething around 6 months. If your baby develops an overbite as a result of pacifier use, you may need to invest in braces later on. Some babies will suck their thumb if a pacifier isn’t available, which has similar impacts on their teeth. Higher chance of ear infections. Studies have shown that children who go without pacifiers have 33% fewer ear infections than kids who do. Too much pacifier sucking causes the tubes in your baby's ears to open more than they should. When these tubes are open, they allow bacteria in secretions from the throat to get into the ear, causing an ear infection. Babies who get more than two ear infections in a year might have trouble forming words and understanding sounds. Choking. Be sure to choose a pacifier with a base that's at least an inch and a half across. This size prevents your baby from getting the pacifier stuck in their mouth or throat. Also, look for a pacifier that has ventilation holes in the base just in case it ever gets trapped in your baby's mouth. Make sure the pacifier is one complete piece. If your baby sucks hard enough on a two-piece pacifier, it may come apart and pose a choking risk. Since pacifiers get worn down over time, make sure you check them regularly and buy more as needed. If the pacifier material becomes weak and breaks off, your baby could swallow a piece of it. Safe Pacifier Use If you decide to use a pacifier with your baby, here are some tips to help you avoid the pitfalls: Best way to introduce a pacifier. When you're ready to introduce the pacifier, try doing the following: Make sure you use the right-sized pacifier. There are two sizes, one for newborn babies through 6 months old, and the other for kids 6 months and older. If your baby resists taking a pacifier, wait until they're in a better mood. As they get older, babies learn to self-soothe in other ways, like the use of white noise and a consistent sleep routine. Use a one-piece pacifier. Choose a pacifier that's a single piece and dishwasher safe. A two-piece pacifier may come apart and be a choking hazard. Clean it often. Make it a habit to boil your baby's pacifier or run it through the dishwasher often to sterilize it. Once your baby's immune system matures (usually around 6 months in full-term babies), you can wash it with soap and water. But don't ""wash"" the pacifier by sticking it in your mouth first. Doing this will only spread more germs. Don't use a pacifier with a hungry baby. You don't want a pacifier to interfere with your baby's nutrition, so only use a pacifier when your baby isn't hungry. Avoid cords or strings. Never place a pacifier on a cord or string around your baby's neck. This is a choking hazard. Know when to stop. As your baby ages, the cons of using a pacifier outweigh the pros. Try phasing the pacifiers out after 6 months. Many children will stop using a pacifier on their own between the ages of 2 and 4. But if your baby has trouble giving up the pacifier when it's time, talk to their doctor or dentist about it. Breaking the Pacifier Habit Many children will give up their pacifiers easily with a little coaxing. Follow these tips for an easy transition: Avoid using harsh words or teasing that can upset your child. There's no need to bully or punish them to break this habit. Once you begin trying to break the habit of using a pacifier, praise your baby's efforts. Start a sticker chart to track your baby's progress. If your child goes from a pacifier to using their fingers for sucking, distract them or keep their hands busy throughout the day."
24,What Is Fitz-Hugh-Curtis Syndrome?,"Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome is a rare disorder that happens when pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) causes swelling of the tissue around the liver . You may also hear it called “ gonococcal perihepatitis ” or “perihepatitis syndrome.” Pelvic inflammatory disease is an infection of a woman’s reproductive organs. Most often it’s caused by sexually transmitted infections (STIs) like chlamydia and gonorrhea . It usually causes inflammation of the uterus, ovaries , fallopian tubes, cervix , or vagina . Sometimes, this inflammation spreads to the covering of the liver or the tissues surrounding the liver in the abdomen . It can also spread to the diaphragm, the muscle that separates the abdominal cavity and the chest. What Causes It? Most cases of Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome are linked to chlamydia or gonorrhea infections. But doctors don’t know exactly what causes these to spur Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome. Some cases may start when an infection spreads to the liver. Other evidence suggests that it could be an autoimmune disease , which is when your body’s natural defenses attack your own healthy tissues. What Are the Symptoms? Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome is marked by sudden, severe pain in the upper right area of your belly, just below the ribs. You might also feel pain on your right shoulder and right arm. Moving usually makes it worse. Other symptoms might include: Fever Chills Night sweat Nausea and vomiting Hiccups Headaches A general feeling of poor health (malaise) The symptoms of PID -- pain in the lower belly and vaginal discharge -- are often present, as well. Who’s at Risk? Women of childbearing age who have PID have the biggest chance of developing Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome. Teens are high-risk, too, because they’re more prone to infections. In very rare cases, men can get it. How Is It Diagnosed? If your doctor is sure you have PID, they’ll run tests to rule out any other conditions and diseases that can cause similar symptoms, like viral hepatitis , pancreatitis , appendicitis , and peptic ulcer disease . These tests might include an ultrasound , chest or stomach X-rays, and CT scans. Your doctor may also perform a laparoscopy . They’ll insert a thin tube into your abdomen to view your liver and surrounding tissue. How Is It Treated? Normally, you would take an antibiotic in pill form or have it injected through an IV. Your doctor might also prescribe pain medicine. If treating the underlying STI doesn’t ease your abdominal pain , your doctor may perform a laparoscopy to remove scar tissue around your liver. During the procedure, they’ll insert a small, thin tool through a small cut made in your belly and cut away the dead tissue (“ adhesions ”). This is rarely done. Can I Prevent Fitz-Hugh-Syndrome? Since this condition is linked to PID, the best way to prevent it is to not get PID. To reduce your risk, you can: Use condoms and limit your number of sex partners Regularly get tested for STIs if you’re sexually active Ask any sexual partners to get tested Avoid douching , which can make you more prone to vaginal infections"
25,What Are Fallen Arches?,"What Are Flat Feet? If you look at an adult foot from the inside, you'll usually notice an upward curve in the middle. This is called an arch. Tendons -- tight bands that attach at the heel and foot bones -- form the arch. Several tendons in your foot and lower leg work together to form the arches in your foot. When the tendons all pull the proper amount, then your foot forms a moderate, normal arch. When tendons do not pull together properly, there is little or no arch. This is called flat foot or fallen arch. How to Check If You Have Flat Feet You can easily test yourself to see if you might have fallen arches or flat feet. Follow these three steps: Get your feet wet. Stand on a flat surface where your footprint will show, such as on a concrete walkway. Step away and look at the prints. If you see complete imprints of the bottom of your feet on the surface, then you likely have flat feet. Many young children have flat feet , a condition referred to as flexible flat feet. When the child stands, the feet look flat. But when the child rises to their toes, a slight arch appears. In most cases, as children grow older, the arches develop. What Causes Flat Feet and Fallen Arches? Broken or dislocated bones in your feet are one possible cause of fallen arches. (Photo credit: WebMD) Flat feet in adults can arise from a variety of causes. Here are the most common: An abnormality that is present from birth Stretched or torn tendons Damage or inflammation of the posterior tibial tendon (PTT), which connects from your lower leg, along your ankle, to the middle of the arch Broken or dislocated bones Some health conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis Nerve problems Other factors that can increase your risk include: Obesity Diabetes Aging Pregnancy Flat Feet Symptoms Many people have flat feet -- and notice no problems and require no treatment. But you may experience the following symptoms: Feet tire easily Painful or achy feet, especially in the areas of the arches and heels The inside bottoms of your feet become swollen Foot movement, such as standing on your toes, is difficult Back and leg pain If you notice any of these symptoms, it's time for a trip to the doctor. Diagnosing Flat Feet and Fallen Arches Your doctor examines your feet to determine two things: Whether you have flat feet The cause(s) An exam may include these steps: Checking your health history for evidence of illnesses or injuries that could be linked to flat feet or fallen arches Looking at the soles of your shoes for unusual wear patterns Observing the feet and legs as you stand and do simple movements, such as rising up on your toes Testing the strength of muscles and tendons, including other tendons in the feet and legs, such as the Achilles tendon or the posterior tibial tendon Taking X-rays or an MRI of your feet How to Fix Flat Feet Treatment for flat feet and fallen arches depends on the severity and cause of the problem. If flat feet cause no pain or other difficulties, then treatment is probably not needed. In other cases, your doctor may suggest one or more of these treatments: Rest and ice to relieve pain and reduce swelling Stretching exercises Pain relief medications, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories Physical therapy Orthotic devices, shoe modifications, braces, or casts Injected medications to reduce inflammation , such as corticosteroids If pain or foot damage is severe, your doctor may recommend surgery. Procedures include the following: Fusing foot or ankle bones together (arthrodesis) Removing bones or bony growths -- also called spurs (excision) Cutting or changing the shape of the bone (osteotomy) Cleaning the tendons' protective coverings (synovectomy) Adding tendon from other parts of your body to tendons in your foot to help balance the ""pull"" of the tendons and form an arch (tendon transfer) Grafting bone to your foot to make the arch rise more naturally (lateral column lengthening) Home Remedies for Flat Feet and Fallen Arches There are home remedies to prevent or manage pain from fallen arches or flat feet. Here are some areas to consider: Wear footwear or shoe inserts that are appropriate to your activity. When pain occurs, try at-home treatment of rest, ice, and over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, or NSAIDS , such as ibuprofen. Talk to your doctor first if you take any other medicines or have any medical problems. Ask your doctor or a physical therapist to show you stretches that can prepare you for feet-intensive activities. Limit or treat risk factors that can make fallen arches or flat feet worse, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and obesity . Avoid activities that put excessive stress on your feet, such as running on roads. Avoid high-impact sports such as basketball, hockey, soccer, and tennis. Know when to get help. When pain is severe or interferes with activities, it's time to see the doctor for a thorough exam and treatment. Types of Foot Pain Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a mix of a skin disorder ( psoriasis ) and joint inflammation (arthritis). It's a long-term condition that can run in families. PsA may cause stiffness and throbbing pain in the tendons over your fingers, toes, and other joints. To treat it: For mild cases of PsA, your doctor may recommend a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) to block the chemicals that cause swelling in your joints. You can get this medication at the pharmacy (aspirin, ibuprofen, or naproxen) or with a prescription. Try hot and cold therapy. Heat helps blood circulation to lessen stiffness. Cold lowers swelling. Manage your stress, which can make your PsA flare. For severe cases, you may need more powerful medications. Options include disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), including biologics, and corticosteroids. Plantar fasciitis is the most common cause of arch pain. Plantar fasciitis can affect the heel, arch, or both. Treatment is the same regardless of the location. For persistent plantar fasciitis, an injection with a mixture of a steroid and local anesthetic can be helpful."
26,Necrotizing Fasciitis (Flesh-Eating Bacteria),"What Is Necrotizing Fasciitis? Necrotizing fasciitis , also known as flesh-eating bacteria or flesh-eating disease, is a rare infection of the skin and tissues below it. ""Necrotizing"" means causing tissue death, and ""fasciitis"" refers to fascia inflammation, which is tissue under the skin. Necrotizing fasciitis is a form of necrotizing soft tissue infection (NSTI). These life-threatening infections affect the skin, muscles, and soft tissue and cause patches of tissue to die. It spreads quickly and aggressively in an infected person, causes tissue death at the infection site, and can be deadly if not treated right away. Every year, between 700 and 1,150 cases are diagnosed in the U.S. Up to 1 in 5 cases of necrotizing fasciitis result in death. It rarely happens in children. Necrotizing fasciitis spreads quickly and aggressively in an infected person. It causes tissue death at the infection site and beyond and can be deadly if not treated quickly. (Photo Credit: Juan Gaertner/Dreamstime) Types of Necrotizing Fasciitis Necrotizing fasciitis includes two types: Type I, or polymicrobial. This type happens when more than one bacteria, usually a mix of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, cause the infection. Type II, or monomicrobial. The monomicrobial form is typically caused by one bacteria, group A streptococcus or Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. Necrotizing Fasciitis Causes Necrotizing fasciitis is commonly caused by group A streptococcus (GAS) bacteria. That's the same type of bacteria that causes strep throat . But, several types of bacteria, including Vibrio vulnificus (bacteria that live in water), staphylococcus, and others, have also been linked to the disease. Necrotizing fasciitis happens when these types of bacteria infect the superficial fascia, a layer of connective tissue below the skin. Flesh-eating bacteria transmission The bacteria that cause necrotizing fasciitis can enter the body through: Surgical wounds Puncture wounds or an injury that doesn't break the skin Burns Minor cuts and scrapes Insect bites Abrasions In some cases, it is unknown how the infection began. Once it takes hold, the infection rapidly destroys muscle, skin, and fat tissue. Necrotizing Fasciitis Risk Factors Having a weakened immune system and certain diseases may make you more likely to get necrotizing fasciitis. Health conditions that may raise your risk include: Alcohol abuse Cancer Chickenpox in childhood Cirrhosis (permanent liver damage) Diabetes Heart disease affecting the heart valves Chronic kidney disease Lung disease , including tuberculosis Peripheral vascular disease Steroid use Use of injectable or IV drugs In very rare cases, dental, tonsil, salivary gland, and sinus issues can cause facial necrotizing fasciitis. Necrotizing Fasciitis Symptoms The early symptoms of an infection with flesh-eating bacteria usually appear within the first 24 hours of infection. Symptoms are similar to those of other conditions like the flu or a less serious skin infection. The early symptoms are also similar to common post-surgical complaints, such as: Serious pain , including areas other than the skin that look swollen or red Inflammation Fever Nausea Symptoms often include a combination of the following: Increasing pain in the general area of a minor cut, abrasion, or other skin opening Pain that is worse than would be expected from the appearance of the cut or abrasion Redness and warmth around the wound, though symptoms can begin at other areas of the body Flu-like symptoms such as diarrhea , nausea, fever, dizziness, weakness, and general malaise Intense thirst due to dehydration More advanced symptoms happen around the painful infection site within 3 to 4 days of infection. They include: Swelling, possibly along with a purplish rash Large, violet-colored marks that turn into blisters filled with dark, foul-smelling fluid Discoloration, peeling, and flakiness as tissue death ( gangrene ) happens Dizziness, fatigue, or nausea Critical symptoms, which often happen within 4 to 5 days of infection, include: A severe drop in blood pressure Toxic shock Unconsciousness Necrotizing Fasciitis Bacteria Diagnosis Flesh-eating bacteria (necrotizing fasciitis) affects the body quickly, making early diagnosis important to survival. The doctor will examine you and review your symptoms. Having flesh-eating bacteria is a medical emergency, and if a doctor suspects you may have it, you’ll likely be admitted to a hospital and get tested there. Tests to diagnose flesh-eating bacteria (necrotizing fasciitis) include: Blood tests. People with flesh-eating bacteria have high levels of white blood cells. Tissue biopsy . You may need exploratory surgery to remove some of the tissue from the infected area. The tissue is sent to a lab to identify the particular bacteria that’s causing the infection. But you’ll be given some medicine to treat the infection before test results are back. CT scan . A CT scan can show your doctor where fluid and pus are collecting in the body. It also shows the presence of gas bubbles under the skin, which helps confirm the diagnosis. Household members and others who have had close contact with someone with necrotizing fasciitis should be tested for the disease if they have symptoms of an infection. Necrotizing Fasciitis Treatment If you're infected with flesh-eating bacteria, you will get several types of treatment. The extent of treatment depends on the stage of the disease when treatment is started but can include: Intravenous (IV) antibiotic therapy Surgery to remove damaged or dead tissue in order to stop the spread of infection Medications to raise blood pressure Amputations of affected limbs, in some cases Hyperbaric oxygen therapy to preserve healthy tissue Cardiac monitoring and breathing aids Blood transfusions Intravenous immunoglobulin, which helps the body fight infection Necrotizing Fasciitis Complications Serious complications are common and may include: Sepsis Shock Organ failure Loss of an arm or leg due to amputation Severe scarring Death Necrotizing Fasciitis Prevention Washing your hands with soap and water or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer is one of the best steps you can take to prevent flesh-eating bacteria and other skin infections. You can also prevent skin infections by taking these steps: After cleaning, cover an oozing, draining, or open wound with a clean, dry bandage. Get treated by a doctor if you have a serious or deep wound, such as a puncture or gunshot. Don’t go swimming or use a hot tub if you have an open wound or skin infection . There’s no vaccine available to prevent flesh-eating bacteria infection. Necrotizing Fasciitis Outlook Early diagnosis and immediate, aggressive treatment are critical when it comes to fighting this rare skin infection. Many people need more than one procedure to remove damaged, infected tissue. If you have red, swollen skin and it’s not going away, make an appointment with your doctor."
27,Caring for Your Baby's Teeth,"After weeks of watching your baby drool and fuss, you finally spot that first little tooth bud popping up through the gums. Over the next couple of years, your baby's gummy smile will gradually be replaced by two rows of baby teeth . Baby teeth may be small, but they're important. They act as placeholders for adult teeth. Without a healthy set of baby teeth, your child will have trouble chewing, smiling, and speaking clearly. That's why caring for baby teeth and keeping them decay-free is so important. By starting early, your baby gets used to the daily routine. Caring for Your Baby's Gums You can start caring for your baby's gums right away. But at first, the care won't involve a toothbrush and toothpaste . Instead, take these steps: Get a soft, moistened washcloth or piece of gauze. Gently wipe down your baby's gums at least twice a day. Especially wipe your baby's gums after feedings and before bedtime . This will wash off bacteria and prevent them from clinging to gums. Bacteria can leave behind a sticky plaque that damages infant teeth as they come in. Brushing Your Baby's Teeth When the first baby teeth start to pop up, you can graduate to a toothbrush. Your child's pediatrician may suggest waiting until four teeth in a row have come out; others recommend waiting until the child is 2 or 3 years old. Choose a toothbrush with a: Soft brush Small head Large handle At first, just wet the toothbrush. Soaking the brush in warm water for a few minutes before brushing can soften the bristles even more. As soon as teeth erupt, you can start using toothpaste in the amount of a grain of rice. You can increase this to a pea-sized amount of fluoride toothpaste when your child is age 3. Fluoride is a natural mineral that protects and strengthens the teeth against the formation of cavities. Using it early in your child's life will provide extra protection for developing teeth. However, dentists recommend that you start fluoride toothpaste when your child can reliably spit out the toothpaste after brushing. Kids get lots of fluoride from drinking water and shouldn't swallow fluoride in the concentration it is in toothpaste. Many children's toothpastes are flavored with child-pleasing tastes to further encourage brushing. Select your child's favorite. Also, look for toothpastes that carry the American Dental Association's (ADA) Seal of Acceptance. This shows that the toothpaste has met ADA criteria for safety and effectiveness. Finally, read the manufacturer's label. Some toothpastes are not recommended for children under a certain age. Brush your child's teeth twice a day -- in the morning and just before bed. Spend 2 minutes brushing, concentrating a good portion of this time on the back molars. This is an area where cavities often first develop. Replace the toothbrush every 3 or 4 months, or sooner if it shows signs of wear. Never share a toothbrush with others. You should brush your baby's teeth until they are old enough to hold the brush. Floss once all the baby teeth have come in. Floss sticks or picks instead of regular string floss may be easier for both you and your child. Brush and floss just before bedtime . After that, don't give your child any food or drink, except water, until the next morning. Continue to supervise the process until your child can rinse and spit without assistance. That usually happens at around age 6. Up until this time, remember that the best way to teach children how to brush their teeth is to lead by example. Allowing your child to watch you brush your teeth teaches the importance of good oral hygiene. After your child is 6 years old, a fluoride rinse can help prevent cavities. Ask your dentist which product is right. Make sure your child is getting enough fluoride, which helps lessen cavities. If your local water supply does not contain fluoride, ask your dentist or doctor if you need to use a supplement. Keep on the lookout for any signs of baby tooth decay -- brown or white spots or pits on the teeth. If you or your pediatrician notices any problems, take your child to a pediatric dentist for an exam. Even if there isn't a problem, your child should go for their first dentist visit by age 1 or within 6 months after their first tooth comes in. Early preventive care saves you money in the long run. A CDC report shows that dental care costs are nearly 40% lower over a 5-year period for children who see a dentist by age 5. The dentist can give you advice about: Baby tooth care Teething Fluoride Thumb sucking Sealant coatings, which can help prevent tooth decay in children Diet Teething Children's teeth emerge at different times. Check out this chart to learn more. It can take 2 years before all of the infant teeth have made their way through your baby's gums. The process as each tooth emerges is called ""teething."" It can be a trying time for you and your baby. Teething is uncomfortable. That's why your baby cries and fusses in the days or weeks before each baby tooth pops up. Babies can display other teething symptoms, too, including: Drooling Swollen gums Slightly higher than normal temperature Here are a few tips to relieve your baby's teething pain: Teething rings. Let your baby chew on a clean, cool teething ring or cold washcloth. Just avoid giving your child anything that is small enough to choke on. Also avoid a teething ring with liquid inside that could break open. Gum rubbing. Rub your baby's gums with a clean finger. Pain relief. Topical pain relievers are rubbed on the gums. Those that contain benzocaine should not be used for teething. The FDA warns that such products can cause dangerous, potentially life-threatening side effects. Give your baby acetaminophen occasionally to relieve pain, but ask your pediatrician first. Never give your child aspirin . It has been linked with a rare but serious condition called Reye's syndrome in children. If your baby is unusually irritable or inconsolable, call your pediatrician. Preventing Cavities In addition to caring for baby teeth, you need to protect them. To prevent cavities, only fill your baby's bottle with: Formula Breast milk Water Special electrolyte solutions when the child has diarrhea Don't give your child fruit juices, sodas, and other sugary drinks. Limit them to 4 ounces a day of 100% fruit juice. Give non-sugary drinks and foods at mealtimes, and use juice only as a treat. Sweet drinks -- even milk -- can settle on the teeth. This can lead to baby tooth decay -- also known as baby bottle tooth decay. Also at risk are children whose pacifiers are often dipped in sugar or syrup. Giving an infant a sugary drink at nap time or nighttime is particularly harmful because the flow of saliva decreases during sleep. Bacteria feed on the sugar from sweet drinks and produce acid, which attacks baby's teeth. If you have to send your baby to bed or naps with a bottle or sippy cup, fill it with water only. Also avoid putting anything sweet -- such as sugar or honey -- on your baby's pacifier . Although baby bottle tooth decay typically happens in the upper front teeth, other teeth may also be affected. If baby bottle tooth decay is left untreated, pain and infection can result. Severely decayed teeth may need to be removed. If teeth are infected or lost too early due to baby bottle tooth decay, your child may develop poor eating habits, speech problems, crooked teeth , and damaged adult teeth. They will also have higher chances that adult teeth will end up being crooked. It's never too late to break bad habits. If your child drinks sweetened liquids from the bottle or sleeps with a bottle, break the habit now and cut the risk of baby bottle tooth decay by: Slowly diluting the bottle contents with water over 2 to 3 weeks. Once that period is over, fill the bottle with only water. Ditch the pacifier by age 2 or 3. There are lots of good reasons to let your child use a pacifier , but in the long term, it can affect how their teeth line up. It can also change the shape of the mouth. Talk to your doctor if they are still using a pacifier past age 3. Watch out for sweet medicine. Children's medications can be flavored and sugary. If they stick on the teeth, the chance of cavities goes up. Children on medications for chronic conditions such as asthma and heart problems often have a higher decay rate. Antibiotics and some asthma medications can cause an overgrowth of yeast, which can lead to a fungal infection called oral thrush. Signs are creamy, curd-like patches on the tongue or inside the mouth. Talk to your dentist about how often to brush if your child is taking long-term medications. It could be as often as four times a day. Remember that healthy baby teeth will lead to healthy permanent teeth."
28,Rare Types of Anemia,"Think of your red blood cells as the transport system that carries oxygen to your body’s tissues. When you have anemia , your body doesn’t make enough red blood cells , or these cells don’t work as well as they should. You end up feeling weak, tired , and short of breath. Anemia comes in many forms. Iron-deficiency anemia is most common. Other types of the disease affect only small numbers of people. Here’s a look at some of the rare types of anemia and how they’re treated. Aplastic (or Hypoplastic) Anemia Blood cells are made from stem cells in your bone marrow. When you have aplastic anemia , stem cells in your bone marrow are damaged and can’t make enough new blood cells. You’re either born with aplastic anemia, meaning you inherited a gene from your parents that caused it, or you develop it (acquired). Acquired aplastic anemia is the more common of the two, and sometimes it’s only temporary. Acquired causes include: Autoimmune diseases such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis Chemicals such as pesticides, arsenic, and benzene Infections including hepatitis , Epstein-Barr virus, and HIV Radiation and chemotherapy treatments for cancer Inherited conditions such as Fanconi anemia, Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, and Diamond-Blackfan anemia, can damage cells and also cause aplastic anemia. Symptoms of aplastic anemia can include everything from shortness of breath and dizziness to headaches , pale skin , chest pain , fast heart rate ( tachycardia ), and cold hands and feet . One way to treat aplastic anemia is with a blood transfusion . You’ll get a donor’s blood through a vein. A stem cell transplant can also treat aplastic anemia. It replaces the damaged stem cells in your bone marrow with healthy cells. Sideroblastic Anemia In this group of blood disorders , your body can't use iron to make hemoglobin -- the protein that carries oxygen in your blood. The iron buildup causes the formation of abnormal red blood cells called sideroblasts. There are two main types of sideroblastic anemia: Acquired sideroblastic anemia can be caused by exposure to certain chemicals or drugs . Hereditary sideroblastic anemia happens when a gene mutation disrupts normal hemoglobin production. This gene produces “heme,” the part of hemoglobin that carries oxygen. Symptoms for both types include: Chest pain Fast heartbeat, or tachycardia Headaches Trouble breathing Weakness and fatigue Treatment for sideroblastic anemia depends on the cause. If you have acquired anemia, you'll need to avoid the chemical or drug that caused it. Other treatments include vitamin B6 therapy and bone marrow or stem cell transplants. Myelodysplastic Syndromes Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are diseases that are caused when your bone marrow is damaged and can't make enough healthy blood cells. MDS is a type of cancer . Some people are born with a gene that causes MDS. These genes are usually passed down from one or both parents. If you have certain inherited syndromes, including Fanconi anemia, Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, Diamond Blackfan anemia, familial platelet disorder, and severe congenital neutropenia , you could be more likely to develop MDS. A small number of people also get MDS after radiation or chemotherapy treatment for cancer . Another risk is exposure to chemicals like benzene, which is found in tobacco smoke. Some people don’t have symptoms with MDS, but others do, including: Bruising or bleeding Infection Fever Shortness of breath Weakness and fatigue Weight loss Oncologists (cancer doctors) and hematologists (blood doctors) treat MDS with chemotherapy, hematopoietic growth factors, and stem cell or bone marrow transplants . Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia Autoimmune hemolytic anemia happens when your body's immune system attacks and destroys red blood cells faster than it can make new ones. If you have an autoimmune disease like lupus , you’re also more likely to get this type of anemia. Medicines such as methyldopa ( Aldomet ), penicillin , and quinine ( Qualaquin ) can also cause autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Symptoms include fatigue, pale skin, fast heartbeat (tachycardia), trouble breathing, chills, backache, and yellow skin ( jaundice ). Treating the disease that caused the anemia can also stop your red blood cell damage. If you have an autoimmune disease, your doctor might treat you with steroid drugs to calm your immune system , which can help the anemia. Congenital Dyserythropoietic Anemia (CDA) CDA is a group of inherited anemias that reduce the number of healthy red blood cells in the body. All CDAs are passed down through families. There are three types of CDA, types 1, 2, and 3. Type 2 is the most common and type 3 is the rarest. Symptoms include chronic anemia, fatigue, yellow skin and eyes (jaundice), pale skin, and missing fingers and toes at birth. Some people never need treatment. But depending on the severity of the disease, your doctor might recommend a blood transfusion, a stem cell transplant, or medicines to lower iron levels or interferon alfa-2A, a drug typically used for treating leukemia and melanoma . Diamond-Blackfan Anemia If you have Diamond-Blackfan anemia, your bone marrow doesn't make enough red blood cells. Doctors think it is caused by changes to your genes. Symptoms of Diamond-Blackfan anemia include: Fast heartbeat (tachycardia) Fatigue Heart murmur Irritability Pale skin Short height Sleepiness Weak bones Treatments include everything from steroids that can help produce more red blood cells to red blood cell transfusions and bone marrow transplants. Megaloblastic Anemia With this type of anemia, your bone marrow produces abnormally structured red blood cells that are too large and too young. Because they’re not mature or healthy, they can't carry oxygen throughout your body very well. Megaloblastic anemia is caused by too little vitamin B12 (cobalamin) or vitamin B9 (folate). Your body needs these vitamins to make red blood cells. Some people with megaloblastic anemia might not have symptoms for many years. But once symptoms do appear, they’re similar to other types of anemia, and include: Dizziness and fatigue Diarrhea , nausea Fast or irregular heartbeat (tachycardia) Muscle pain or weakness Pale skin Trouble breathing Doctors treat megaloblastic anemia with vitamin B9 and vitamin B12 supplements to replace what your body is missing. You'll also need treatment for any disease -- such as Crohn's -- that caused your body to lack these vitamins. Fanconi Anemia Fanconi anemia makes your blood marrow produce too few blood cells. It's hereditary, meaning it’s passed down from one of your parents through a gene mutation. Symptoms and physical traits of Fanconi anemia include: Abnormal thumbs Easy bruising and bleeding Fatigue Frequent infections Heart , kidney , and bone problems Skin color changes Small body, head, and eyes If you have Fanconi anemia, you’re more likely to get a type of cancer called acute myeloid leukemia , or AML. Your odds of getting cancers of the head, neck, skin, GI tract, or genitals also go up. Treatment depends on several factors, including what stage it’s in and the severity of physical complications. Treatments include hormone therapy and growth factors to boost blood cell growth. If symptoms become severe, your doctor might recommend a bone marrow stem cell transplant. Oftentimes a bone marrow transplant can cure the problems altogether."
29,What Is Folic Acid Deficiency Anemia?,"Anemia is a condition that happens when you don’t have enough red blood cells to carry oxygen to your body’s tissues. One reason could be that you don’t have enough hemoglobin to make red blood cells . That’s a protein in red blood cells that helps carry oxygen throughout the body. You can also become anemic by not getting enough folate (vitamin B9), the natural form of folic acid found in foods. What Causes It? You can get folic acid deficiency anemia a few different ways. Here are some examples: You don’t eat enough foods that contain folic acid. This is the case for most people. You might not be eating enough foods like leafy green vegetables, beans, citrus fruits, or whole grains . You drink a lot of alcohol . Over time, this makes it harder for your intestines to absorb folate. You have stomach problems . When your small intestine isn’t working the way it should, your body has a hard time hanging on to as much folate as it needs. For instance, people with celiac disease are at risk for this type of anemia . People with cancer are, as well. You’re pregnant . A growing baby absorbs lots of folic acid from its mother. A medication you’re taking is keeping your body from absorbing folate. This is the case with many medicines, such as phenytoin ( Dilantin ), methotrexate , sulfasalazine , triamterene , pyrimethamine , trimethoprim - sulfamethoxazole , and barbiturates . You were born with it. Problems absorbing enough folic acid can run in families. Infants with this problem need treatment right away to avoid long-term problems. What Are the Symptoms? Any kind of anemia can cause problems like: Fatigue Lack of energy Feeling short of breath Headaches Pale skin Racing heart Weight loss or not feeling hungry Ringing in your ears If your anemia is caused by not having enough folate in your body, you could also notice the following: Reduced sense of taste Diarrhea Pins and needles feeling or numbness in your hands and feet Muscle weakness Depression How Is It Diagnosed? To check for folate deficiency anemia , your doctor will ask you about your symptoms. They might also order blood tests and a complete blood count ( CBC ) test to measure the number and appearance of your red blood cells. If you have a lack of folate, your red blood cells look large and immature. What’s the Treatment? Folate deficiency anemia is prevented and treated by eating a healthy diet. This includes foods rich in folic acid, such as nuts, leafy green vegetables, enriched breads and cereals, and fruit. Your doctor will also likely prescribe you a daily folic acid supplement. If your folate levels return to normal, you may be able to stop taking it. But some people need a supplement for life. Are There Any Complications? Most cases of this type of anemia are easily treated. Severe effects are rare. But if you’ve been without folate for a long time, your risk of having some types of cancer and heart disease goes up. You might also find it harder to get pregnant . Your fertility will likely return to normal once you’re getting enough folate again. If you are pregnant and don’t get enough folate, you are at higher risk of a placental abruption . This happens when the placenta pulls away from the uterus wall and disrupts blood flow to your fetus . It can cause pain and increased bleeding. Your fetus could die. Your unborn child can also be harmed by too little folate. They may have a low birth weight or be born before their due date . They are also more likely to have spina bifida, a disease that causes damage to the spinal cord and nerves. When Should I Call the Doctor? As soon as you notice any symptoms. If left untreated, some of these could get worse and your anemia could cause lasting damage."
30,Follicular Lymphoma,"What Is Follicular Lymphoma? Follicular lymphoma is a cancer that affects white blood cells called lymphocytes. They help your body fight infections. There are two types of lymphomas: Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's, based on the kind of white blood cell they affect. Follicular lymphoma is a non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. When you have follicular lymphoma, the sick blood cells can travel to many parts of your body, such as your organs, bone marrow, and lymph nodes (pea-sized glands in your neck, groin, and under your arms that are part of your immune system). The blood cells can form tumors in these places. Although follicular lymphoma usually can't be cured, you can live long and well with it. This cancer grows slowly. You may not need treatment for many years, or ever. But if you do, it usually works well. Many people will have long-term remission after treatment. Causes Doctors don't know what causes follicular and other non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Unlike some cancers, they are not passed down in families. In some cases, radiation or cancer -causing chemicals, or certain infections, may be a cause. But other times there is no known cause. You are more likely to get follicular lymphoma as you age. People are 60 years old, on average, when diagnosed. You may be at an increased risk to get the disease if you have HIV , rheumatoid arthritis , lupus , or celiac disease , which are all immune system disorders . Symptoms You may have no symptoms of follicular lymphoma. If you do have symptoms, you may have: Painless swelling of the lymph nodes in your neck, groin, stomach , or armpits Shortness of breath Fatigue Night sweats Weight loss Getting a Diagnosis First, your doctor will do a physical exam and ask you questions like: Have you had a lump in your neck, groin, stomach, or armpits? Was it painful? Did it go away and come back? Have you ever been diagnosed with cancer? How was it treated? Have you been exposed to any cancer-causing chemicals on the job? Have you been diagnosed with HIV, rheumatoid arthritis , lupus , or celiac disease ? Have you had an organ transplant ? If your doctor notices that you have enlarged lymph nodes, it doesn't mean you have cancer. They're most often caused by infections or other problems. If you do have one, your doctor may give you an antibiotic to see if it shrinks in a few weeks. If you have other lymphoma symptoms or the lymph node is very large, or if it doesn't shrink with antibiotics , your doctor will do a biopsy . To do that, they'll remove either the whole lymph node or part of it. If a node is hard to reach, they may use a very thin needle to remove a little bit of lymph node tissue through your skin . Doctors call this a fine-needle aspiration biopsy. This is usually an ""outpatient"" procedure, which means you don't need to stay overnight in a hospital. Sometimes your doctor may numb the area first, but that's not always needed. Using a microscope, experts will check the tissue from the biopsy. If it shows that you have follicular lymphoma, your doctor will want to do other tests. These may include blood tests and: Bone marrow test . Your doctor will take samples of your bone marrow, usually from the back of your hip bone. For this test, you lie down on a table and get a shot that will numb the area. Then your doctor uses a needle to remove a small amount of liquid bone marrow. Your doctor will look at the sample under a microscope and check for sick cells to see if the disease has spread. CT scan , or computed tomography. It's a powerful X-ray that makes detailed pictures inside your body. PET scan . This creates 3-D images by using a radioactive chemical that collects where your cells are very active. The results will help your doctor check which parts of your body are affected and the stage of the lymphoma. Based on that information, you and your doctor can decide if you need treatment and what kind. You may want to get a second opinion before you take action. Questions for Your Doctor Are there any other tests I should have before we decide on treatment? What is the stage of my follicular lymphoma and what does it mean? Does it need to be treated right away? What treatment do you recommend? Why? What are the side effects of this treatment? How will it affect my daily life? How likely is my follicular lymphoma to come back after this treatment? What will we do if it does come back? You may want to ask your doctor if you can take part in a clinical trial . These test new drugs to see if they are safe and if they work. They often are a way for people to try new medicine that isn't yet available to everyone. Your doctor can tell you if one of these trials might be a good fit for you. Treatment If you have no symptoms, your doctor may decide just to watch you closely. This is called ""watchful waiting."" Studies show it works as well as early treatment. Your doctor may advise starting treatment if: Your lymph nodes keep getting larger You have a fever or night sweats You are losing weight You have low blood counts After treatment, many people stay disease-free for years, although the cancer usually returns. Over time, 30% to 40% of follicular lymphomas behave like or turn into other forms of lymphoma that grow faster and need intensive treatment. If you do need treatment, it may include one or more of the following: Radiation. It kills cancer cells.The radiation comes from a high-energy beam, similar to an X-ray, or from material put inside your body in or near the cancer. Follicular lymphoma responds well to radiation. In some cases, it can cure the cancer. If yours is at an early stage, you may only need radiation. If it's advanced, you may get other treatments as well. Monoclonal antibodies. These are drugs that act like your body's disease-fighting cells. For most people, rituximab ( Rituxan ) and obinutuzumab ( Gazyva ) work well to kill lymphoma cells while doing little damage to normal body tissues. These are often used with chemotherapy as the first treatment in stage II-IV follicular lymphoma. You may also take rituximab as maintenance therapy, to slow the growth of lymphoma. You get it by IV in your doctor's office or at an infusion center. Your dosing schedule will depend on your particular case. Because it must be given slowly, expect it to take several hours at first. Chemotherapy. Usually, you get this treatment by IV or as a pill. Because it enters the bloodstream and reaches most parts of the body, it works very well for lymphoma. Tazemetostat (Tazverik) may be one option for patients that have failed or are resistant to treatments and can be used for follicular lymphoma with specific types of mutations. It is considered a ""novel"" agent because it targets pathways that are specific to the cancer cells. Other novel agents that are used to treat follicular lymphoma include lenalidomide and copanlisib. Radioimmunotherapy. You get this medication -- Y90 ibritumomab tiuxetan ( Zevalin ) -- through an IV. It delivers radiation straight to a protein on cancer cells. Your doctor may recommend it if your lymphoma comes back or doesn't respond to chemotherapy. Kinase inhibitors. Taken once a day, umbralisib ( Ukoniq ) is a kinase inhibitor. It inhibits multiple kinases. Another kinase inhibitor, copanlisib (Aliquopa), may also be used. Bispecific antibodies. Mosunetuzumab-axgb (Lunsumio) binds the CD20 and CD3 proteins to help bring the cancer cells and T cells together so that the T-cells can destroy the cancer cells. It is administered through IV. ""CAR-T"" therapy, a new form of immunotherapy, may be used for relapsed follicular lymphoma. It involves using specific cells from a person's immune system that have been changed to directly target the cancer cells. Stem cell transplant. This is used mainly when follicular lymphoma returns. These aren't the ""embryonic"" stem cells that you may have heard about. They come from either your own stem cells or a donor's bone marrow. Close relatives, such as your brother or sister, are the best chance for a good match. If that doesn't work out, you need to get on a list of potential donors from strangers. Sometimes the best chance for the right stem cells for you will be from someone who is in the same racial or ethnic background as you. Before the transplant you will likely need to get treated with high doses of chemo for about a week or two. This can be a tough process because you may get side effects like nausea and mouth sores. When the high-dose chemo is done, you'll start the transplant. The new stem cells are given to you through an IV. You won't feel any pain from this, and you're awake while it’s happening. After your transplant, it could take 2 to 6 weeks for the stem cells to multiply and start making new blood cells. During this time you may be in the hospital, or at the very least, will need to make visits every day to get checked by your transplant team. It can take 6 months to a year until the number of normal blood cells in your body gets back to what it should be. Taking Care of Yourself It's normal to have mixed feelings: happy that you're not having symptoms or are disease-free after treatment, but worried about what might happen in the future. Despite the uncertainty, you can have a full life. These tips may help: Don't try to ignore whatever fears you have . Let yourself feel them and then practice letting them go. Talking about them to a friend or counselor often helps. Focus on what you can do to be healthy now . Exercise , eat a balanced diet, and make any other changes that would help take better care of yourself. This helps you feel better and have more sense of control. Spend some peaceful time every day . This can be helpful even if it's just for a few minutes. When you are stressed out, summon up that feeling. What to Expect With follicular lymphoma, time is on your side. It grows slowly, and new and better treatments are helping people live disease-free for longer periods of time. Most people respond well to treatment -- not just the first time, but if it comes back. Stay informed and talk to your doctor about all your treatment options and the clinical trials that might be helpful for you. Getting Support The Lymphoma Research Foundation offers many resources on treatments, research advances, clinical trials, and ways to cope with follicular lymphoma. These include one-on-one peer support and financial aid programs."
31,"Cysts, Lumps, Bumps, and Your Skin","There are a number of skin conditions that cause lumps and bumps to appear on the surface or just below the skin. This article covers some of the most common ones, and includes the following: Skin cysts (also called epidermoid cysts) Cherry angioma Dermatofibromas Folliculitis Keratoacanthoma Keratosis pilaris Lipomas Neurofibromas Skin Cysts Cysts are noncancerous, closed pockets of tissue that can be filled with fluid, pus, or other material. Cysts are common on the skin and can appear anywhere. They feel like large peas under the surface of the skin. Cysts can develop as a result of infection, clogging of sebaceous glands (oil glands), or around foreign bodies, such as earrings. What Are the Symptoms of Skin Cysts? Skin or epidermoid cysts usually are: Slow-growing Painless Smooth to the touch when they are rolled under the skin How Are Skin Cysts Treated? Cysts usually do not cause pain unless they rupture or become infected or inflamed. Most cysts do not disappear on their own without treatment. Some cysts may need to be drained to relieve symptoms. That involves piercing the cyst with a scalpel and draining it. That doesn't cure the cyst, however. Some inflamed cysts can be treated with an injection of cortisone medication to cause it to shrink. Cysts that do not respond to other treatments or reoccur can be removed surgically if they cause troublesome symptoms. Cherry Angioma and Your Skin A cherry angioma is a smooth, cherry-red bump on the skin. The size of the growths can vary from the size of a pinhead to about a quarter inch in diameter. Although cherry angiomas usually appear on the trunk of the body, they can occur nearly anywhere. The cause of cherry angiomas is not known. The growths usually appear on people over age 40. In children, these lesions are called port-wine stains. Cherry angiomas are smooth, cherry-red bumps that develop on the skin, usually on the trunk of the body. They have no symptoms and there is no known cause. They can be the size of a pinhead or up to a quarter inch in diameter. What Are the Symptoms of Cherry Angiomas? Cherry angiomas have no symptoms. How Is a Cherry Angioma Treated? In most cases, cherry angiomas do not require treatment. If they are cosmetically unappealing or are subject to bleeding, angiomas may be removed by lasers, shave biopsy, or electrocautery -- the process of burning or destroying tissue by use of a small probe with an electric current running through it. Removal may cause scarring. Learn more about red birthmarks and your skin. Dermatofibromas and Your Skin Dermatofibromas are harmless round, red-brownish skin growths that are most commonly found on the arms and legs of adults. Dermatofibromas contain scar tissue and feel like hard lumps in the skin. Sometimes dermatofibromas appear after injury, like a bug bite or after bumping your arm or leg. Dermatofibroma. Also called benign fibrous histiocytoma, a dermatofibroma is a non-cancerous fibrous nodule that can occur anywhere on the body, but are more commonly found on the arms, legs and  upper back.  In most cases, they are small and have no symptoms but in rare cases skin cancers may develop within a dermatofibroma. What Are the Symptoms of Dermatofibromas? The symptoms of dermatofibromas include: A red, brown, or purple growth that can change colors over time A growth that is as small as a BB pellet Tenderness, pain, and itching ; however, growths are usually painless A dimple that appears when the growth is pinched How Are Dermatofibromas Treated? In most cases, there is no need to treat dermatofibromas. However, the growths can be removed surgically or can be flattened by being frozen with liquid nitrogen. See a photo of what a dermatofibroma looks like. Epidermoid Cysts and Your Skin Epidermoid cysts, also called sebaceous cysts or skin cysts, are benign (non-cancerous) skin cysts formed by an outpouching from the hair follicle. Most commonly, epidermoid cysts are found on the genitals, chest, and back; but, they also can occur in other areas of the skin. What Are the Symptoms of Epidermoid Cysts? In general, epidermoid or skin cysts have a round appearance. A dark portion of the cyst is visible on the skin. If the cysts become infected, they will become red and tender. When the cysts are squeezed, they can produce a cheesy white discharge. How Are Epidermoid Cysts Treated? The effective treatment of epidermoid cysts requires that the sac of the cyst be completely removed. If the cyst is squeezed and the discharge is forced out without removing the sac, the cyst will return. Usually, a doctor will be able to remove the cyst by making only a small incision in the skin. Antibiotics may be prescribed to treat infected cysts and intralesional steroid injections help with swelling and inflammation. Learn more about skin cysts . Folliculitis and Your Skin Folliculitis is an inflammation of the hair follicles. It can be caused by an infection in the hair follicles, by chemical irritation or by physical irritation (for example, shaving or friction from clothing). Typical body sites that are involved in folliculitis include the face, thighs, and scalp. Folliculitis is more common in people who have diabetes. It also is more common in people who are obese or have compromised immune systems. What Are the Symptoms of Folliculitis? The main lesion in folliculitis is a papule or pustule with a central hair. The hair shaft in the middle of the lesion may not be seen. Other signs and symptoms include: Multiple red pimples and/or pustules on hair-bearing areas of the body Itching skin How Is Folliculitis Treated? Topical antibiotics, oral antibiotics, or antifungal drugs may be used to treat infections associated with folliculitis, depending on the underlying cause. Treatment also involves preventing further damage to the hair follicles. Steps that can help achieve this goal include: Minimizing friction from clothing Not shaving in the affected area, if possible. If shaving is necessary, use a clean new razor blade or an electric razor each time. Also moisturize the hair before shaving, and shave in the direction of the growth of the hair Keeping the area clean See a photo of what folliculitis looks like. Keratoacanthoma and Your Skin A keratoacanthoma occurs when cells in a hair follicle do not grow normally. The growth may be triggered by a minor skin injury in an area that previously had suffered sun damage. Ultraviolet radiation from sun exposure is the biggest risk factor in keratoacanthomas. A keratoacanthoma usually will appear on sun-damaged skin as a thick growth that has a central crusted plug. Keratoacanthomas appear most often in people who are over the age of 60 and they are considered a low-grade skin cancer . What Are the Symptoms of a Keratoacanthoma? Keratoacanthomas are rapidly growing, red, dome-shaped bumps with central craters. Some keratoacanthomas can grow to extremely large sizes, occasionally 1 to 3 inches in diameter. How Are Keratoacanthomas Treated? Keratoacanthomas can be removed by: Cryotherapy (freezing the growth with liquid nitrogen) Curettage (scraping and burning off the growth) Surgical removal Injection of a cancer drug directly into the lesion Learn more about keratoacanthomas . Keratosis Pilaris and Your Skin Keratosis pilaris (commonly called KP) appears as ""chicken skin bumps"" on the skin. These bumps usually appear on the upper arms and thighs. They also can appear on the cheeks, back, and buttocks. Keratosis pilaris, while unattractive, is harmless. What Are the Symptoms of Keratosis Pilaris? This disorder appears as small, rough bumps. The bumps are usually white or red, but do not itch or hurt. Keratosis pilaris is usually worse during the winter months or other times of low humidity when skin becomes dry. It also may worsen during pregnancy or after childbirth. How Is Keratosis Pilaris Treated? Although the condition may remain for years, it gradually improves before age 30 in most cases. Treatment of keratosis pilaris is not medically necessary; but, individuals with this condition may want to seek treatment for cosmetic reasons. The initial treatment of keratosis pilaris should be intensive moisturizing. A cream such as AmLactin or Lac-Hydrin can be applied after bathing, and then re-applied several times a day. Other treatments may include: Medicated creams containing urea (Carmol-20) or alpha-hydroxy acids ( Aqua Glycolic , Lacticare) applied twice daily Efforts to unplug pores by taking long, hot soaking tub baths and then rubbing and exfoliating the areas with a coarse washcloth or stiff brush Learn more about keratosis pilaris. Lipomas and Your Skin Lipomas are subcutaneous soft tissue tumors that usually are slow-growing and are harmless. They have a soft, rubbery consistency. Lipomas tend to form on the trunk, shoulders, neck, but can appear elsewhere on the body. What Are the Symptoms of Lipomas? Lipomas can appear as solitary nodules or in groups. Most lipomas are less than 5 cm in diameter and have no symptoms, but they can cause pain when they compress nerves. How Are Lipomas Treated? Lipomas are not removed unless there is a cosmetic concern, a compression of surrounding structures, or an uncertain diagnosis. Lipomas generally do not infiltrate into surrounding tissue so they can be removed easily by excision. There are alternatives to standard excision. One is to manually squeeze the lipoma through a small incision. This technique is useful in areas with thin dermis, such as the face and extremities. Liposuction -assisted lipectomy also can be used to remove large lipomas with minimal scarring. Lipotherapy is another option. In this, a fat dissolving drug called deoxycholic acid (Kybella) is injected directly into the lipoma, leaving no scarring. Learn more about lipomas. Neurofibromas and Your Skin Neurofibromas are soft, fleshy growths that occur on or under the skin, sometimes even deep within the body. These are harmless tumors; however, they can turn malignant or cancerous in rare cases. What Are the Symptoms of Neurofibromas? The symptoms of neurofibromas may vary, depending on the locations and the sizes of the tumors. Symptoms can include: A painless, slow-growing mass Occasional pain Electric-like ""shock"" when the affected area is touched Neurological problems if the tumor involves a major motor or sensory nerve or a nerve that is compressed between the tumor and a hard structure How Are Neurofibromas Treated? If the tumor is not causing any symptoms, no treatment is necessary. However, doctors may choose to surgically remove the neurofibroma if it is affecting a major nerve. In most cases, neurofibromas are treated successfully and do not recur. See a photo of what neurofibromas looks like."
32,Nail-Patella Syndrome,"Also known as hereditary osteo-onychodysplasia, nail-patella syndrome is a genetic disease that largely affects the development of your finger and toenails but can cause changes in the development of knees, elbows and the pelvis. Nails may be absent or underdeveloped and discolored, split, ridged, or pitted. It is caused by the LMX1B gene. Those with Nail-patella syndrome are also at risk for kidney disease and glaucoma.

33,Food Addiction,"The idea that you can be addicted to food has recently gained increasing support. That comes from brain imaging and other studies of the effects of compulsive overeating on pleasure centers in the brain. Experiments in animals and humans show that, for some people, the same reward and pleasure centers of the brain that are triggered by addictive drugs like cocaine and heroin are also activated by food, especially highly palatable foods rich in: Sugar Fat Salt Like addictive drugs, highly palatable foods trigger feel-good brain chemicals including dopamine. Once you experience pleasure associated with increased dopamine transmission in your brain's reward pathway from eating certain foods, you may quickly feel the need to eat again. Reward signals from highly palatable foods may override your signals of fullness and satisfaction. As a result, you may keep eating, even when you're not hungry. Compulsive overeating is a type of behavioral addiction, meaning that you can become preoccupied with a behavior (such as eating, gambling, or shopping) that triggers intense pleasure. When you have food addiction, you lose control over your eating behavior and spend excessive amounts of time involved with food and overeating , or anticipating the emotional effects of compulsive overeating. You also may develop a kind of tolerance to food. That means that the more you eat, the less you're satisfied. Scientists believe that food addiction may play an important role in obesity. But you can still have food addiction if you don't have obesity . Your body may be genetically programmed to better handle the extra calories you take in. Or maybe you increase your physical activity to compensate for overeating. When you're addicted to food, you continue to eat despite negative consequences, such as weight gain or damaged relationships. And like people addicted to drugs or gambling, you have trouble stopping your behavior. Signs of Food Addiction Researchers at Yale University's Rudd Center for Food Science & Policy have developed a questionnaire that can help identify food addictions . To see if these apply to you, ask yourself if you: Keep eating certain foods even if you're no longer hungry Eat to the point of feeling ill Worry about not eating certain types of foods or worry about cutting down on certain types of foods When certain foods aren't available, go out of your way to obtain them The questionnaire also asks about the impact of your relationship with food on your personal life. Ask yourself if you: Eat certain foods so often or in such large amounts that you eat instead of working, spending time with your family, or doing recreational activities. Avoid professional or social situations where certain foods are available because of fear of overeating. Have problems functioning effectively at your job or school because of food and eating. The questionnaire also asks about psychological withdrawal symptoms. For example, when you cut down on certain foods (excluding caffeinated beverages), do you have: Anxiety Agitation Other physical symptoms The questionnaire also tries to gauge the impact of your food decisions on your emotions. Do these apply to you? Eating food causes problems such as depression, anxiety , self-loathing, or guilt. You need to eat more and more food to reduce negative emotions or increase pleasure. Eating the same amount of food doesn't reduce negative emotions or increase pleasure the way it used to. Help for Food Addiction Experts are working to understand and find treatments for food addiction. Some think its recovery may be more complicated than recovery from other kinds of addictions. Alcoholics, for example, can ultimately abstain from drinking alcohol. But people who are addicted to food still need to eat. A nutritionist, psychologist , or doctor who's educated about food addiction may be able to help you break your cycle of compulsive overeating. There are a growing number of programs that can help, too. Groups like Food Addicts in Recovery Anonymous are based on the 12-step program used for alcohol, drugs, and gambling addictions. Others, like Food Addicts Anonymous, use 12-step principles along with strict diets. They can help you avoid ingredients like sugar, refined flour, and wheat. Food Addiction vs. Binge Eating Disorder Food addiction and binge eating disorder ( BED ) have some similarities, but they're also different. Unlike food addiction, BED involves often eating and compulsively eating large amounts of food in a short amount of time. You may feel guilt or shame afterward. BED may start in your teens or early adulthood as part of a cycle that involves a restrictive diet. You might begin a diet to lose weight but find that it’s too hard to stick to -- especially if you use food as a coping tool. You might reach a breaking point and binge on “forbidden” foods, then feel guilt and shame, and then resume the diet. Whether you're dealing with food addiction or BED,  talk to your doctor. They can refer you to a mental health specialist who can provide tools for managing your eating habits and help you figure out what works best for you."
34,Food Allergy and Food Intolerance,"People often have an unpleasant reaction to something they ate and think they have a food allergy . But they may be having something else: a reaction called food intolerance . What's the difference? A food allergy is caused by your immune system reacting to the food when it doesn't need to. With a food intolerance , your immune system isn't responsible. Most of the time it's a problem with digesting the food. For example, being allergic to milk is different from not being able to digest it properly because of lactose intolerance . Some people come from families where allergies are common -- not necessarily food allergies , but perhaps hay fever , asthma , or hives . When both of your parents have allergies , you're more likely to have food allergies than if only one parent has allergies . If you think you have a food allergy, see a doctor to confirm what's triggering it and get help managing and treating it. Sometimes allergic reactions to food can be severe, even life-threatening. How Food Allergies Work Food allergies involve two parts of your immune system. One is immunoglobulin E (IgE), a type of protein called an antibody that moves through the blood . The other is mast cells, which you have in all body tissues but especially in places like your nose, throat, lungs , skin , and digestive tract. The first time you eat a food you're allergic to, certain cells make a lot of IgE for the part of the food that triggers your allergy, called an allergen. The IgE gets released and attaches to the surface of mast cells. You won't have a reaction yet, but now you're set up for one. The next time you eat that food, the allergen interacts with that IgE and triggers the mast cells to release chemicals such as histamine . Depending on the tissue they're in, these chemicals will cause various symptoms. And since some food allergens aren't broken down by the heat of cooking or by stomach acids or enzymes that digest food, they can cross into your bloodstream. From there, they can travel and cause allergic reactions throughout your body. The digestion process affects the timing and the location. You may feel itching in your mouth . Then you may have symptoms such as vomiting , diarrhea , or belly pain . Food allergens in your blood can cause a drop in blood pressure . As they reach your skin, they can trigger hives or eczema . In the lungs , they may cause wheezing . All of this takes place within a few minutes to an hour. Which Food Allergies Are Most Common? In adults, they include: Peanuts Tree nuts, such as walnuts Shellfish, including shrimp, crayfish, lobster, and crab For children, the food allergens that most often cause problems are: Eggs Milk Peanuts Adults usually don't lose their allergies, but children do sometimes. Kids are more likely to outgrow allergies to milk, eggs, and soy than to peanuts, fish , and shrimp. The foods that you'll react to are often those that you eat regularly. In Japan, for example, you'll find rice allergy. In Scandinavia, codfish allergy is common. Cross Reactivity and Oral Allergy Syndrome When you have a life-threatening allergic reaction to a certain food, your doctor will probably recommend that you avoid similar foods, too. For example, if you react to shrimp, you're probably allergic to other shellfish like crab, lobster, and crayfish. This is called cross-reactivity. Another example of cross-reactivity is oral allergy syndrome. It happens in people who are highly sensitive to ragweed. During ragweed season, when they try to eat melons, especially cantaloupe, their mouths may itch. Similarly, people who have severe birch pollen allergy may also react to apple peels. Exercise-Induced Food Allergy At least one type of food allergy needs more than simply eating the allergen to cause a reaction. If you have exercise-induced food allergy, you won't have a reaction unless you then do something physically active. As your body temperature goes up, you'll begin to itch, get lightheaded, and could have hives or even anaphylaxis . Fortunately, the cure is simple: Don't eat that food for a couple of hours before you work out. Is It Really a Food Allergy? A differential diagnosis is the process of telling the difference between a food allergy, a food intolerance, and other illnesses. When you go to the doctor's office and say, ""I think I have a food allergy,"" they have to consider a list of other things that could cause similar symptoms and be confused with a food allergy. These include: Food poisoning Histamine toxicity Food additives , including sulfites, MSG, and dyes Lactose intolerance Gluten intolerance Other diseases Psychological triggers Foods can get contaminated with bacteria and toxins. Tainted meat sometimes mimics a food allergy when it's really a type of food poisoning . Histamine can reach high levels in cheese , some wines, and in certain kinds of fish , especially tuna and mackerel, if it hasn't been refrigerated properly. When you eat foods with a lot of histamine, you could have a reaction that looks like an allergic reaction. It's called histamine toxicity. Sulfites are made naturally during the fermentation of wine, and they're added to other foods to enhance crispness or prevent mold growth. High concentrations of sulfites can pose problems for people with severe asthma . They give off a gas called sulfur dioxide, which the person breathes in while they're eating the food. This irritates their lungs and can trigger an asthma attack . That's why the FDA banned sulfites as spray-on preservatives for fresh fruits and vegetables . But sulfites are still used in some foods. Monosodium glutamate (MSG) is naturally in foods including tomatoes , cheese, and mushrooms. It's added to others to boost flavor. When eaten in large amounts, it can cause flushing, warmth, headache , pressure in your face, chest pain , or feelings of detachment. Yellow dye number 5 can cause hives, although that's rare. Lactose intolerance , the most common food intolerance, affects at least 1 out of 10 people. Lactase is an enzyme in the lining of the gut. It breaks down lactose, a type of sugar in milk and other dairy products. If you don't have enough lactase, you can't digest lactose. Instead, bacteria eat the lactose, which creates gas , and you can get bloating, stomach pain , and diarrhea. Your doctor can measure your body's response to lactose by testing blood samples. Gluten intolerance is not the same as celiac disease . Celiac disease is caused by an abnormal immune response to gluten, a protein found in wheat and some other grains. Gluten intolerance, on the other hand, involves how the digestive system handles gluten. Both of these are different from food allergies. Several other diseases share symptoms with food allergies, including ulcers and digestive system cancers. These can lead to vomiting , diarrhea, or cramping pain that gets worse when you eat. Some people may have a food intolerance with a psychological trigger. An unpleasant event, often during childhood, that's tied to eating a particular food can bring on a rush of unpleasant sensations when you eat that food later, even as an adult. Diagnosing Food Allergies First, the doctor asks detailed questions like: Did the reaction come on quickly, within an hour of eating the food? Did anyone else get sick? How much did you eat before the reaction started? How was the food prepared? Did you eat anything else at the same time? Did you take an antihistamine or do something else? Did it help? Does this always happen when you eat that food? These help the doctor understand what's going on and could point to another explanation. For example, if you ate fish contaminated with histamine, everyone who ate that same fish would have gotten sick, too. Some people will have a violent allergic reaction only to raw or undercooked fish because heat destroys the allergens they're sensitive to. Or other foods in the meal can delay digestion so the allergic reaction starts later. Your doctor may ask you to keep a food diary, a record of each meal and any reaction you have. This gives more detail for you both to look for patterns. You may find that the severity of your reaction is related to the amount of food that you ate. The next step might be an elimination diet, which you do with the help of your doctor. You start by not eating a suspect food, like eggs. If your symptoms go away, that strongly suggests an allergy. Then you try eating that food again to see if the symptoms come back, which confirms the diagnosis. But you can't do an elimination diet if your reactions are severe (because you wouldn't want to trigger it) or you don't have them often. Tests for Food Allergies If your doctor thinks a specific food allergy is likely, you may get tests to measure your allergic response. One of these is a scratch puncture test. The doctor or technician puts a drop of a solution made with the food on your forearm or back. Then they'll prick your skin with a needle through the drop and watch for swelling or redness. Skin tests are quick, simple, and relatively safe. But experts don't recommend making a diagnosis based on a skin test alone. Your skin test may show an allergy to a food without you having allergic reactions when eating that food. So your doctor will diagnose a food allergy only when you have a positive skin test and a history of reactions to the same food. If you're extremely allergic and have severe reactions, skin testing could be dangerous. It also can't be done if you have severe eczema. Instead, your doctor can use blood tests such as RAST and ELISA that measure the amount of food-specific IgE. These tests may cost more, and results take longer. Again, a positive result doesn't necessarily mean you have a food allergy. A food challenge, or feeding test, is another way to confirm or rule out an allergy. It's done with your doctor there. You eat small servings of food every 15-30 minutes that have increasing amounts of the suspected allergen in them until you either have a reaction or eat a meal-sized portion . In a ""double-blind"" test, neither you or your doctor know if what you're eating has the allergen in it. This type of testing is actually most common when the doctor believes that your reaction is not from a specific food. The test can provide evidence to look elsewhere to find the real cause of the reaction. Of course, people with severe reactions can't do food challenges, and it's hard to test more than one food allergy at the same time. It's also expensive because it takes a lot of time. Unproven Ways to Diagnose Food Allergies Some techniques can't effectively identify food allergies. These include: Cytotoxicity testing. A food allergen is added to your blood sample. A technician then checks the sample under the microscope to see if white cells in the blood ""die."" Sublingual or subcutaneous provocative challenge . It's similar to a skin test, but the sample of food allergen goes under your tongue or gets injected under your skin. Immune complex assay . This blood test looks for groups of certain antibodies bound to the food allergen. But these clusters normally form as part of food digestion, and everyone, if tested with a sensitive enough measurement, has them. IgG subclass assay . This blood test looks specifically for certain kinds of IgG antibodies, but they're part of a normal immune response. Treatment for Food Allergies The main way to deal with food allergies is to avoid them. For highly allergic people, even tiny amounts of an allergen (as little as 1/44,000 of a peanut kernel) can trigger a reaction. Less-sensitive people may be able to have small amounts of a food that they're allergic to. Once you've identified the food, you have to stop eating it. That may mean reading long, detailed ingredient lists because many allergy-triggering foods are in things you wouldn't expect to find them in. Peanuts, for example, may be included for protein , and eggs are in some salad dressings. At restaurants, you might have to ask about the ingredients that are in specific dishes or in the kitchen. Even people who are very careful can make a mistake, so if you have severe food allergies, you must be prepared to treat an accidental exposure. If you've had anaphylactic reactions to a food, you should wear a medical alert bracelet or necklace. And you should carry two auto-injectors of epinephrine ( Auvi-Q , EpiPen , Symjepi ) and be ready to use them if you think a reaction is starting. Mild symptoms such as tingling in your mouth and throat or an upset stomach might not be an allergic reaction, but you should still give yourself an injection. It won't hurt, and it could save your life. Then call 911 or get a ride to the emergency room. Parents and caregivers should protect children from their trigger foods and know what to do if the child eats one. Schools should have plans in place to address any related emergency. Children aged 4 to 17 with a severe peanut allergy could benefit from the newly approved drug Palforzia, which may help lessen a severe reaction, although they should still avoid peanuts. Medications can help relieve food allergy symptoms that aren't part of an anaphylactic reaction: Antihistamines for digestive issues, hives, and sneezing and a runny nose Bronchodilators for tightened airways or asthma -like symptoms But these won't prevent an allergic reaction if you take them before eating the food. No medication can. Putting a dilute solution of a food under your tongue about a half hour before you eat it as a way to ""neutralize"" your exposure doesn't work either. Allergy pills and shots are being studied as a way to desensitize people to food allergens. You regularly get small amounts of food extracts over a long period of time to help your body build up a kind of tolerance. But researchers haven't yet proven that allergy shots work for food allergies. New studies looking for by sing oral immunotherapy was able to induce remission of peanut allergy , in some young children. Research from the National Institutes of Health found that giving peanut oral immunotherapy to children ages 1to 3 who were highly allergic to peanuts  was able to safely desensitized most of them to peanuts, And it induced remission of peanut allergy in one-fifth of them. Food Allergies in Infants and Children Milk and soy allergies are particularly common in infants and young children, probably because their immune and digestive systems are still developing. These allergies can appear within days to months of birth. They may not show up as hives and asthma , but rather lead to colic and perhaps blood in poop or poor growth. Typically, the doctor sees a very unhappy colicky child who may not sleep well at night and diagnoses a food allergy partly by changing their diet, like switching from cow's milk to soy formula . This type of allergy tends to disappear within a few years. Doctors recommend only breastfeeding infants for the first 4-6 months, if possible, for many reasons, but there's no proof that it prevents food allergies later in life. While some pregnant women may hope limiting their diets while they're pregnant or breastfeeding may help their children avoid allergies, the experts disagree and don't suggest it. Soy formula isn't a good way to prevent allergies either. Issues Mistakenly Linked to Food Allergies Although some people think certain illnesses can be caused by food allergies, evidence doesn't back up such claims. Histamines in cheese or red wine, for example, can trigger migraines . But we can't say that food allergies actually cause migraines . Rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis aren't made worse by foods. Food allergies don't cause ""allergic tension fatigue syndrome,"" where people get tired , nervous, and may have problems concentrating or headaches . Cerebral allergy is a term that describes when mast cells are supposedly releasing their chemicals in the brain -- and nowhere else in the body -- causing trouble concentrating and headaches. Most doctors don't recognize cerebral allergy as a disorder. Even when their surroundings are very clean, some people have many general complaints like problems concentrating, fatigue, or depression . Environmental illness may be the result of small amounts of allergens or toxins, but not food allergies. Researchers have found that hyperactivity in children may be related to food additives , but only occasionally and only when the child has had a lot of them. A food allergy won't directly affect a child's behavior, although their symptoms might make them cranky and difficult, and allergy medications can make them sleepy."
35,What You Should Know About Food Poisoning,"If you’ve ever had food poisoning, you probably had a good idea that’s what it was even before you talked to your doctor. It’s hard to miss the main symptoms: stomach cramps, vomiting , and diarrhea . They can hit a few hours or a day or two after you eat the food that caused the problem. Your symptoms usually pass in a few days or even in mere hours. But if your discomfort doesn’t go away, you may need to get checked and find out exactly what made you sick. You should also see a doctor if along with other symptoms you have high fever , blood in your stool, or feel dehydrated or unable to keep any food or liquid down. Your doctor may be able to tell you what caused it after running tests. But they aren’t always necessary and don’t confirm every case. Do I Have Food Poisoning? Many times, your doctor will diagnose food poisoning based simply on your symptoms. While the main symptoms are nausea , diarrhea, vomiting, and stomach cramps, you also may have a fever, headache , muscle and joint aches, or blood in your stool. You may also be dehydrated, so your mouth and throat feel dry and you don’t pee as often as you typically do. Dehydration can make you dizzy when you stand up. Rarely, food poisoning can cause blurry or double vision , tingling, or weakness. More than 250 bacteria, viruses, and parasites are known to cause food poisoning. They can exist in foods at any stage, such as when they're growing, packaged, shipped, stored, or cooked. Certain foods are more likely to harbor bad germs. These include raw eggs, unpasteurized milk and juice, soft cheeses, and raw or undercooked meat or seafood. Fresh produce is another risk. Foods made in bulk are problematic, too. A single bad egg could affect the whole batch of omelets in a buffet. You could make trouble for yourself by not washing the cutting board or your hands as you prepare different foods. Your chances of getting food poisoning are higher in the summer. In 90-degree heat, food can start to spoil within an hour. At a picnic or during a camping trip, you are more likely to eat undercooked grilled meats or to handle raw meat without access to soap and water. Bacteria can grow quickly inside tepid coolers. So if you're picnicking on a hot day, put leftovers back in with fresh ice. Common Causes In 4 out of 5 cases of food poisoning, you never find out exactly what caused it. That's OK because you most likely will get better on your own. But in cases where the culprit is found, it's usually one of the following: Norovirus , often called stomach flu , is behind more than half of the foodborne illnesses in the U.S. where the cause is known. Norovirus can sicken you not only through eating contaminated foods, but also through touching doorknobs and other surfaces or having contact with an infected person. You should wipe down the kitchen if someone in your house has it. It typically takes 12-48 hours before you feel sick. Your symptoms may last 1-3 days. Salmonella is the name of a group of bacteria. They grow in undercooked eggs and meat. But you can also get salmonella from unpasteurized milk or cheese. Some fruits and vegetables, such as melons or sprouts, can also cause it. Symptoms start within 1-3 days and can last up to a week. Clostridium perfringens are bacteria that are more likely to show up when foods are prepared in bulk, such as in cafeterias or nursing homes or for catered events. Cooking kills the bacteria but not its spores. So food left warming can grow new germs. You can get it from beef, chicken, or gravy. You may have cramps and diarrhea but no other symptoms. You get sick within 6-24 hours and are usually feeling better in a couple of days. Campylobacter comes from undercooked poultry, unpasteurized milk, and sometimes water. It may take 2-5 days to develop symptoms you can notice. But you should feel better in another 2-10 days. You can't pass it to anyone. But if it's serious, you might have bloody diarrhea. More Serious Causes Some bacteria cause fewer cases of food poisoning but can make you very sick. They can even cause death. They include: E. coli , a type of bacteria found in the intestines of animals. You can get this from undercooked ground beef, unpasteurized milk, sprouts, or any food or liquid that has had contact with animal feces or sewage. Some strains are harmless. Others can make you very sick. Listeria is an unusual bacteria that can grow in cold temperatures such as in the refrigerator. It's found in smoked fish, raw (unpasteurized) cheeses, ice cream, pates, hot dogs, and deli meats. Typically, symptoms start within 24 hours of eating the product and you have short-lived gastroenteritis with watery diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and sometimes fever. That said, it can be much more serious in older people, pregnant women, or those with weakened immune systems. The bacteria can enter the bloodstream and central nervous system and cause an infection called listeriosis. This usually happens within 10 days to a month after exposure. In addition to diarrhea and vomiting, listeria can cause unusual symptoms, including weakness, confusion, and a stiff neck. It can also be deadly. If you have any of these symptoms, call your doctor right away. Tests for Food Poisoning If your illness is severe or complicated, your doctor may run some of the following tests. Stool cultures are the most common lab test for food poisoning . Your doctor may order one if you have a fever, ntense stomach pain , or bloody diarrhea, or if there is an outbreak that is being tracked. They may also order one if you have symptoms that linger. A sample of your stool can help tell if your sickness is related to bacteria. It can even reveal the germ’s DNA “fingerprint” and which antibiotics will kill it. Viruses are more difficult to see in culture,  so if the specific virus needs to be identified, your doctor may order stool tests to look for the germ's DNA fingerprint.Microscopic exams of stool can identify parasites. Stool tests aren’t always accurate, and they can take several days to come back. Blood tests may be ordered if your doctor thinks the infection has spread into the blood. Blood tests can detect the bacteria Listeria monocytogenes and the hepatitis A virus. Specific blood tests can tell how sick you are by looking for inflammation and signs that you’re dehydrated. Stool or blood tests can check for toxins, such as for botulism, which can be deadly. Imaging tests such as MRIs and CT scans aren’t often used in food poisoning cases. But they can help rule out other causes for your symptoms. Could It Be Something Else? A host of other conditions can lead to many of the same symptoms of food poisoning . Most common is mon-foodborne gastroenteritis , which is most often caused by a virus. For instance, Norovirus causes both foodborne gastroenteritis (from contaminated food or water) and viral gastroenteritis from person to person spread. Other causes include gallbladder problems , pancreatitis , and inflammatory bowel disease . So figuring out if you have food poisoning is as much about the timing as it is about the symptoms themselves. Delayed Symptoms In most cases, food poisoning usually shows up hours or days after you’ve eaten something that made you sick.  That can make it hard to know if it's food poisoning or something else. The delay also makes it tricky to trace the illness back to the specific food or drink. But different organisms work at different speeds. For example, Staphylococcus aureus can give you cramps, diarrhea, and nausea in as little as 30 minutes after you eat or drink. This bacterium grows in meats, eggs , and cream that haven’t been refrigerated properly. Another, far less common, cause of foodborne illness is the hepatitis A virus. It can lie in wait as long as 50 days before making itself known. You can get the virus through foods and drinks that have been in contact with sewage water. You’re more likely to get the virus when traveling in developing countries. Food Poisoning Treatment Call 911 if you think the food poisoning may be from seafood or wild mushrooms, or if the person is severely dehydrated. First, control n ausea and vomiting : Avoid solid foods until vomiting ends. Then eat light, bland foods, such as saltine crackers, bananas, rice, or bread. Sipping liquids may help avoid vomiting. Don’t eat fried, greasy, spicy, or sweet foods. Don’t take anti-nausea or anti- diarrhea medication without asking your doctor. They have side effects and may make some kinds of diarrhea worse. Your doctor may give you anti-nausea medication if you are at risk of being dehydrated. It’s important to prevent dehydration : Drink clear fluids, starting with small sips and gradually drinking more. If vomiting and diarrhea last more than 24 hours, drink an oral rehydration solution. Call a doctor right away if symptoms last more than 3 days or you have: Severe belly pain Fever Bloody diarrhea or dark stools Vomiting that is prolonged or bloody Signs of dehydration , such as dry mouth , decreased urination, dizziness , fatigue , or increased heart rate or breathing rate Food Poisoning Prevention Food safety for high-risk groups Food poisoning is more common and riskier for people with weakened immune systems, infants and young children, pregnant women, and the elderly. If you fall into one of these groups, try to avoid: Sushi and other raw seafoods and partly cooked shellfish like mussels, clams, and scallops. Refrigerated smoked seafood. These usually have labels that say “Nova-style,” “lox,” “kippered,” “jerky,” or “smoked.” Smoked seafood should be safe if you cook it well or if it has been canned or stored on a shelf. Unpasteurized juice and cider, including fresh-squeezed. These drinks can be safe if you boil them for 1 minute. Soft cheeses (Brie and Camembert), blue-veined cheeses (Roquefort) and Mexican-style cheeses (queso blanco, queso fresco, Panela). These are often made from unpasteurized milk, especially when they’re sold at farmer’s markets. Feta is also often made with raw milk. Stick with hard cheeses like cheddar or Swiss. Raw or partly cooked eggs. That means staying away from cookie and cake batter (not even a lick of the spoon). Same for homemade eggnog, tiramisu, Caesar dressing, hollandaise sauce, and ice cream . If you buy one of these products at the store, check the label to make sure it doesn’t contain raw eggs. At home, cook eggs until the yolk is hard. Raw or undercooked sprouts such as alfalfa, clover, mung beans, and radishes. Premade salads from the deli that contain meat or seafood. Canned versions are safe. Pâtés or meat spreads that have been refrigerated (they may be unpasteurized). Hot dogs, cold cuts, and luncheon and deli meats, even if they’re labeled cooked. Eat them only after you’ve reheated them steaming hot. Make sure no juices from these products end up on your hands or on plates, utensils, or counters. Food safety in the grocery store Before you load items into the shopping cart: Check the ingredients for unpasteurized milk or raw eggs. Make sure the “sell by” date hasn’t passed. Don’t buy food in dented or bulging cans or in damaged packaging. Pick up meat, poultry, and seafood just before you check out to limit the time they go unrefrigerated. Wrap meats in separate plastic bags so they don’t touch other items. Go directly home after you buy your food, and put away refrigerated items right away. Food safety in the kitchen These tips will help make your home-cooked meals safe: Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Also wash hands during cooking and preparations if you switch from one food to another. Keep countertops clean. Rinse all fruits and vegetables , even if you’re not going to eat the skin. Don’t let raw meat, poultry, seafood, and eggs come into contact with other foods on cutting boards, countertops, utensils, and other surfaces. Don’t touch any foods if you have symptoms of food poisoning . Wash cutting boards and knives with antibacterial soap and warm to hot water after handling raw meat, poultry, seafood, or eggs. Wooden cutting boards are not recommended because they can be harder to clean. Do not thaw foods at room temperature. Thaw foods in the refrigerator, and use them promptly. Do not refreeze foods if they have been thawed all the way. Don’t set out eggs, meats, poultry, seafood, or milk at room temperature for long. Cooking kills bacteria. Use a thermometer to make sure meats are cooked to safe temperatures. For beef and pork, it’s 145 F. For poultry, it’s 165 F. Keep your fridge temperature below 40 F and your freezer at 0 F. Food safety while eating out You have more control over the safety of  foods cooked at home than in a restaurant. But you can still take some safe steps when eating out: Choose where you eat carefully. If the restaurant looks dirty to you, it could be a sign that it isn’t handling or serving food properly. People who eat often at fast-food restaurants are more likely to report stomach issues than those who don’t visit as often. Check with your local health department’s restaurant inspection reports. Some states and cities require restaurants to post their health ratings in a visible spot. Always ask for your hamburger or other ground meat well done. For whole steak, roast, or a chop, medium rare (145 F) can be safe. Raw-meat dishes like steak tartare are risky. Make sure there are no raw or undercooked eggs in anything you order. If you take home food, put it in the fridge within 2 hours of leaving the restaurant. If it’s above 90 F outside, make that 1 hour. Food safety while traveling Who doesn’t love a vacation? But you need to be careful when you travel, especially to developing countries. Eat packaged or dry foods. Many of the bugs that cause food poisoning prefer moisture. Dry foods such as bread or chips or factory-sealed foods such as tuna are usually a safe bet. Go for bottled, canned, or hot drinks. Carbonated drinks are a good choice, because the bubbles will tell you it’s been sealed properly. You should be good with coffee or tea if it arrives steaming hot. Avoid raw food, local wild game, and tap water and ice in developing countries. Other safety tips Breastfeed your baby if possible. Mother's milk is the safest food for young infants. Breastfeeding may prevent many foodborne illnesses and other health problems. Wash your hands with soap after handling reptiles, turtles, birds, or after contact with human or pet feces. If you have diarrhea or vomiting , do not prepare food for others, especially people in high-risk groups. Always wash your hands before preparing food or eating. Always wash your hands after using the toilet, changing diapers , or coughing or sneezing ."
36,Diabetes Foot Care,"You're more likely to have foot problems with diabetes because it can damage your nerves and lessen blood flow to your feet. The American Diabetes Association estimates that it's the reason 1 in 5 people with diabetes who seek hospital care do so. One of the best things you can do for your feet is to keep your blood sugar levels under control. Small cuts or sores don't heal as well, and they can take longer to recover. If your blood sugar isn't well-controlled, you can also have poor or no feeling in your feet. You might not even realize you have a minor injury. Diabetes can also dry the skin on your feet and make your heels crack. The big risk is infection. Germs or fungus can get into small cuts or cracks. You have to take care of your feet when you have diabetes. If you think you've gotten an infection, tell your doctor right away. Early treatment can keep it from spreading. And that makes you more likely to avoid bigger problems. Poor foot care may lead to amputation of a foot or leg. Your doctor will check yours each year for problems. If you take good care of your feet, you can prevent many serious problems related to diabetes. Wash and Dry Your Feet Daily Keep your feet clean. But don’t soak them for a long time. This can dry your skin. Use mild soaps and warm water. Pat your skin dry; do not rub. Thoroughly dry your feet. After washing, put lotion or petroleum jelly on them to prevent cracking. But not between your toes -- this can lead to an infection! Sprinkle on a nonmedicated powder before putting on your socks and shoes to help keep your feet dry. In winter, cold weather and central heating can dry out your skin. Take extra care to moisturize your feet and keep them warm. Wear socks to bed if your feet get cold. Check Your Feet Every Day Look carefully at the tops and bottoms of your feet. Use a mirror or have someone else do it if you can't see them. Set a specific time each day to do this check. Use good light so you can spot any problems. Check for dry, cracked skin on your feet, toes, and heels. Look at your feet, toes, and heels for blisters , cuts, scratches, bruises, scrapes, or other sores. Check between your toes for cuts or fungus that might cause athlete’s foot. Check for redness, increased warmth, or tenderness when you touch an area. Watch for ingrown toenails, corns, and calluses . If you get a blister or sore from your shoes, don't ""pop"" it. Put a bandage over it, and wear a different pair of shoes. Take Care of Your Toenails Cut toenails after bathing, when they are soft. Trim them straight across, then smooth with a nail file. Avoid cutting into the corners of toes. Don't let the corners of your toenails grow into the skin. This could lead to an ingrown toenail . You may want a nail technician or podiatrist (foot doctor) to do it for you. If you get pedicures at a nail salon, bring your own nail tools. Don't cut cuticles. Don’t use anything sharp to clean under your toenails or to remove calluses. You don’t want to accidentally get a cut that could let an infection set in. You can use a pumice stone to gently smooth your heels after taking a shower or bath. Don't rub too harshly. Be Careful When Exercising Exercise regularly to keep your blood flow healthy. Aim to move your body for at least 30 minutes a day. Walk and work out in comfortable shoes. Don't exercise when you have open sores on your feet. Ask your doctor what type of activity is best for you. Protect Your Feet With Shoes and Socks Never go barefoot or only in socks. You don’t want to step on rocks, tacks, or small pieces of glass that could cut your feet. Always protect your feet with shoes, hard-soled slippers, or similar footwear. Wear shoes/boots that will protect your feet from weather conditions like cold and moisture. Wear slippers at home. Don't wear shoes with high heels and pointed toes. Avoid shoes that leave your toes or heels unprotected, like open-toed shoes, flip-flops, or sandals. They leave you vulnerable for injury and infections. Change your socks daily. Wear natural-fibers: cotton, wool, or a cotton-wool blend. Don’t use socks with seams that might rub against your skin and cause blisters . Avoid tight socks. Try on new footwear with the type of socks you usually wear. Don't wear new shoes for more than an hour at a time. Look and feel inside your shoes before putting them on to make sure there's nothing irritating in them or rough areas. Wear special shoes if your doctor recommends them. Replace your shoes when they show signs of wear, such as heels that are worn down on one side or lining that is torn. Make Sure Your Shoes Fit Are your shoes too narrow? Is your foot crammed into the shoe? If you have neuropathy ( nerve damage ), you may not notice that your shoes are too tight. Use this simple test to check: Stand on a piece of paper in bare feet. (Make sure you're standing and not sitting. Your foot changes shape.) Trace the outline of your foot. Put your shoe on and stand on another piece of paper. Trace the outline of your shoe. Compare the tracings. The shoe should be at least 1/2 inch longer than your longest toe and as wide as your foot. It’s best to shop for shoes at the end of the day, when your feet are usually at their largest. Good Shoe Choices Shoes that are too tight or too loose may lead to blisters. People with diabetes should wear shoes that have: Closed toes and heels An outer sole made of stiff material Leather uppers without a seam inside, canvas, or suede. Look for a cushioned sole to absorb pressure. Pick shoes with laces over loafers, because they provide better support. Insides that are soft with no rough areas Have at least two pairs of shoes so you can switch pairs. Break in new shoes slowly. Wear them for about an hour a day the first few days. Diabetic Socks Well-fitting, quality shoes are necessary, but you also might want to think about wearing diabetic socks. They can: Improve blood flow to your feet Keep your feet dry Keep fungal infections off your feet Provide cushion All of these things help keep your feet healthy and injury-free. There’s no one standard for what makes a diabetic sock, but the best ones have things like: Flat or no seams to prevent rubbing and blisters Stretchy cuffs that don’t constrict blood flow Moisture-wicking materials to keep your feet dry Softness, with extra thickness in the heel and ball of your foot A light color to spot blood or other fluids that might signal injury or infection A foot-conforming fit with no wrinkles or bunches Don't wear stretch socks or socks made of nylon. Cuts, Bumps, Sores, and Burns Don't wait to treat a minor foot problem if you have diabetes. Report foot injuries and infections right away. Follow your doctor's guidelines and first aid guidelines. Don't self-treat your corns, calluses, or other foot problems . Go to your doctor or podiatrist to treat these conditions. Check water temperature with your elbow or a thermometer, not your foot, to make sure it’s not hot (over about 90 F). Don't wash your feet in hot water, which could cause burns. Don't use a heating pad, water bottles, or electric blankets on your feet, because they could cause burns. Don't cross your legs or stand in one position for a long time. This can block blood flow to your feet. Help Prevent Infections Watch your blood sugar levels and follow your diet as your doctor directs. If you keep your blood sugar and weight under control, you may have fewer foot problems. Don’t smoke. Smoking can narrow your blood vessels and raise your chance of getting foot problems. Also, note any cuts, scratches, scrapes, blisters, corns, or calluses, even if they're small. Let your doctor or podiatrist know in case you need medical treatment. When to Talk to Your Doctor Your doctor should look at your feet during each visit. Give them a call when you notice problems such as: Athlete's foot (cracking between the toes) Sores or wounds on your feet called ulcers. They often develop on the balls of your feet or the bottoms of your toes. Ingrown toenails Increasing numbness or pain Calluses, warts , or corns. Don’t try to treat them yourself with over-the-counter pads or liquids. Don’t try to cut them off your skin. Ask your podiatrist or doctor to remove them safely. Redness, swelling, or drainage that could be a sign of an infection. Nails that seem thicker, yellow, changed in shape, striped, or not growing the way they usually do. This could be a sign of an injury or infection. Blackening of skin Bunions Infection Hammer toes (when the middle joint of toes is permanently bent downward) If your foot, ankle , or toe is swollen, red, hot to the touch, changed in shape or size, or hurts when you move it, you may have a sprain or fracture. Damage to your nerves can raise your chance of a serious condition called Charcot foot , which causes a change in the shape of the foot."
37,What Is Plantar Fasciitis?,"What Is Plantar Fasciitis? Plantar fasciitis is a degenerative condition of the thick band of tissue (also called a fascia) at the bottom of your foot that runs from your heel to your toes. Doctors once thought bony growths called heel spurs brought on the pain . Now they believe that heel spurs are the result -- not the cause -- of plantar fasciitis. Symptoms of Plantar Fasciitis Plantar fasciitis causes pain in your heel. It’s usually worse when you take your first steps in the morning or after you’ve been sitting for a long time. It tends to feel better with activity but worsens again after you spend a long time on your feet . Plantar Fasciitis Causes and Risk Factors Your fascia supports the muscles and arch of your foot. When it’s overly strained, you can get tiny tears on its surface. This can bring on pain and inflammation . You’re at greater risk of plantar fasciitis if you: Are obese Have an unusual walk or foot position Often wear high-heeled shoes Spend many hours standing each day Diagnosing Plantar Fasciitis Your doctor will ask about your symptoms and check your feet to see where you’re having pain. They sometimes want you to have imaging tests to make sure something else isn’t causing your problem. These tests include: An X-ray to rule out bone fractures or arthritis An MRI to look for fractures Plantar Fasciitis Treatment Your treatments may include: Icing the area . Night splints. You wear these to stretch your calf and foot while you sleep . Physical therapy . Certain exercises can stretch your fascia and Achilles tendon and strengthen your leg muscles, which will make your ankle and heel more stable. Rest. Stop doing things that make the pain worse. This might include some types of exercise , like running or jumping. Supportive shoes or inserts. Shoes with thick soles and extra cushioning will make it less painful for you to stand or walk. Arch supports can distribute pressure more evenly across your feet. Taking pain-relieving non-steroidal anti-inflammatories ( NSAIDs ) like ibuprofen or naproxen sodium. You shouldn’t take these for more than a month, so talk with your doctor. Once you begin treatment, you’ll usually see gradual improvement that can take up to several months for resolution. If you do not see improvement in pain and function within 6 – 12 weeks, your doctor might try treatments like injections of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) to ease inflammation. In rare cases, you might need surgery."
38,Arthritis Footcare: It's in the Shoes,"Many forms of arthritis commonly affect the feet. When they do, walking can be difficult and painful. Osteoarthritis frequently causes degeneration of the cartilage and bony spurs at the base of the big toe. This is what leads to bunions . Wider shoes may be necessary. High-heeled and pointed shoes should be avoided since they can put pressure at the point of the bunion. Degeneration of the arch of the foot can lead to spur formation on the top of the foot. This can put pressure on adjacent nerves of sensation, which can cause burning of the foot and toes. When this discomfort occurs, patients should avoid tying the shoe tightly or wear a shoe that does not bind at the point of the spur. Rheumatoid arthritis causes inflammation of the joints at the ball of the foot, which loosens their ligaments. This can cause the bone to push against the skin of the bottom of the foot. The result can be tender calluses and ulcerations at the ball of the foot. These may even require surgical repair. A bar of leather attached to the bottom of the shoe behind the arch of the foot can help by displacing pressure from the ball to the middle of the foot. Another option for taking pressure off the bottom of the foot is to wear shoes with rocker bottom soles and proper arch support. Further rheumatoid deformity can cause the toes to cock up, which can lead to abrasion of the tops of the toes. Box-toed shoes can be extremely comfortable for persons with these deformities. Lumps of soft tissues, called nodules, can form on the sides of the foot, heel, or toes. Nodules can ulcerate from abrasion of shoes. Sometimes, slits cut into the shoe at the point of the nodules can help relieve painful pressure. Also, non-tie style laces are now available. These make it easier for a person with rheumatoid arthritis to fasten the shoes. Gout can cause hard deposits of uric acid crystals to form a lump at the inner side of the base of the big toe. Depending on the size of the deposit, there can be abrasion and even ulceration from the shoe. Wider style shoes can be helpful. Doctors will sometimes examine the shoes that a patient has worn to find evidence of deformity -- such as a shoe leaning to one side or another, wear, and alignment. The shoe exam is like a history of how the foot was used in recent months. It can sometimes help define not only causes of foot pain but also causes of ankle , knee , or hip pain . In general, running shoes are often an advantage because of their light weight. Proper shoes can provide welcome relief and often improve function for patients with foot damage from arthritis . When picking out a shoe, ALWAYS try on several pairs and walk around in them before purchasing. The salesperson will understand that you are interested in both function and comfort. Great-fitting shoes are worth investing time and effort. Be kind to your feet and they will get you where you want to go!"
39,What Is Fournier’s Gangrene?,"What Is Fournier's Gangrene? Fournier’s gangrene is a very serious, sometimes fatal infection in your genital or anal area. It’s a type of necrotizing fasciitis (flesh-eating disease) that develops quickly. Gangrene happens when body tissue is dead or is dying because it’s infected or isn’t getting enough blood. Fournier’s gangrene usually involves an infection that gets under the skin of the scrotum (the sac holding the testicles), the penis, or the perineum. The perineum is the area between the penis and the anus or between the vulva (the outer part of the vagina) and the anus. Under the skin, the infection spreads quickly and starts to destroy soft tissues surrounding your muscles, arteries, and nerves. In the worst cases, the dead or dying tissue can stretch to the thighs, stomach, and chest. Is Fournier's gangrene an emergency? Yes, Fournier’s gangrene gets worse quickly and can kill you, so it’s always an emergency. Fournier’s gangrene can be caused by many types of bacteria, including E. coli. Other causes could include group A streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. (Photo Credit: Getty Images) How Common Is Fournier's Gangrene? The disease is very rare. About 1.6 per 100,000 men and many fewer women or children get it each year. One study that looked at 10.7 million hospitalized men and boys found 2,238 cases of Fournier’s gangrene. The same study found just 49 cases in more than 15 million hospitalized women and girls. Rates are highest in men over age 50. In the United States, it's most common in the South. It’s not clear how often people who get Fournier’s gangrene die from it. Some studies say the death rate could be as low as 7.5 %; most studies put the rate at 20% to 40%. Fournier's Gangrene Symptoms What does Fournier’s gangrene feel like? The first thing you might notice is sudden pain or tenderness in the genitals or the area between the genitals and the anus (the perineum). Then you might start to feel sick all over. For example, you might feel tired, sick to your stomach, and get a fever. What does Fournier’s gangrene look like? If you have Fournier's gangrene, the skin on the affected body parts changes color. First, it’s red or purple, then bluish gray and, finally, black. These changes may be hard to see if your skin is dark. Early symptoms of Fournier’s gangrene: Your penis, vulva, scrotum, or perineum looks red or purple. You feel sore around your genitals or in the area between your genitals and your anus. These areas might start to swell. If you have these early symptoms, call your doctor right away. Don’t wait to see if things get worse. Later symptoms of Fournier’s gangrene: These vary from person to person, but can include: Pain around the genitals or anus that gets worse Pain in your belly Color changes in the sore area A bad smell from the sore area Itchiness A popping sound when you rub the sore area Fever and chills A fast heart rate Low blood pressure Confusion Nausea and vomiting Low energy Fournier's Gangrene Causes Fournier’s gangrene usually involves an infection with bacteria. The bacteria can get into tissues under your skin in several ways. These include: Urinary tract infections Bladder infections Surgery Abscesses, infected wounds that drain pus. You can get these near the anus or vulva. Genital piercings Insect bites Injuries during sex Any injury that causes a scratch or burn Circumcision in children Causes in women: If you have female anatomy, Fournier’s gangrene most often happens due to an abscess near your anus or on your vulva. Other causes can include injuries from surgery or radiation treatments. You might get infected with several kinds of bacteria. The most common found in people with Fournier’s gangrene include: Group A streptococci Staphylococcus aureus E. coli Pseudomonas aeruginosa Fournier's Gangrene Risk Factors Fournier’s gangrene is most common in people who have a weak immune system or other health problems. You're more likely to get Fournier’s gangrene if you have: Diabetes. Between 20% and 70% of people who get Fournier’s gangrene have diabetes. But most people with diabetes won’t get Fournier’s gangrene. Alcohol misuse problems HIV infection Liver damage High blood pressure Kidney failure Obesity Heart disease Your risk also is higher if you're: Over 50 A smoker Getting chemotherapy Taking steroid drugs Fournier's gangrene can affect people of any age and gender. Some cases have been reported in infants. But the peak risk is in men ages 50-60. Because secretions can drain through your vagina, having female anatomy seems to lower risks. Can diabetes drugs cause Fournier’s gangrene? The FDA has reported cases in people with type 2 diabetes who were taking certain drugs to lower their blood sugar. These drugs are called SGLT2 inhibitors and include medications such as canagliflozin (Invokana), dapagliflozin (Farxiga), empagliflozin (Jardiance), and ertugliflozin (Steglatro). It’s not clear why people taking those drugs might have a higher risk. One possibility is that the drugs increase the risk of urinary tract infections. Fournier's Gangrene Diagnosis If your doctor thinks you may have Fournier's gangrene, they will ask about your symptoms and look at your skin. If you're in danger, you might start treatment without any other tests. If you do get tests, they could include: A computerized tomography (CT) scan that might help find where the infection is An ultrasound exam that can help rule out other problems that cause similar symptoms X-rays that look for gas in the damaged tissues. Gas is released from some of the bacteria that cause Fournier’s gangrene Blood tests to look for signs of infections and other clues Fournier's Gangrene Treatment The main treatments for Fournier’s gangrene are surgery and antibiotics. You may get surgery very quickly after diagnosis. The doctor will remove as much dead skin and tissue as possible to stop the damage from getting any worse. That kind of surgery is called debridement. You might need several of these surgeries to get rid of all the dead tissue. In rare cases, the entire penis and scrotum might be removed. You'll get antibiotics, drugs to kill the bacteria damaging your body. You may need several kinds of antibiotics. Instead of taking pills, you will get them through an IV, so that the medicine can get directly into your veins. That can kill the harmful bacteria more quickly. Once the infection is under control, you can get reconstructive surgery. The goal will be for your body to look the way it did before the gangrene, if possible. You might also get something called hyperbaric oxygen therapy. That’s when you sit in a special room or lie in a tube with high oxygen levels. The oxygen can help heal wounds and stop bacteria from growing. Recovery from Fournier’s gangrene can take a while. You might spend several weeks in the hospital. Complications of Fournier's Gangrene If Fournier’s gangrene isn't stopped in the earliest stages, you can get serious complications. These can include: Sepsis. When you have an extreme reaction to an infection, inflammation can spread through your body. This is a dangerous situation and can cause your blood pressure to plunge. The most extreme form of sepsis is called septic shock. Organ failure. Your major organs, like your kidneys, heart, and lungs, can stop working when you have sepsis. Blood clots. The inflammation can also make blood cells clump up in your arteries and veins. Blood clots can cause strokes and heart attacks. Complications for women: While women (and those identified as female at birth) are less likely to get Fournier’s gangrene, they often get sicker from it. For example, they spend more days in the hospital and are more likely to need help from breathing machines and other intensive care. Outlook for Fournier's Gangrene You're more likely to survive Fournier’s gangrene than to die from it.  But after the crisis, you might have some lingering problems. These can include: Sexual problems. You might, for example, lose feeling in your genitals and have problems with erections. Needing a colostomy bag. That’s a bag attached to your belly to collect poop when you can’t poop through your anus. Using the bag for a while may help you heal. Depression Digestive problems Urinary tract infections Ongoing pain You might need to see more than one medical specialist to deal with such issues and help improve your quality of life. Can You Prevent Fournier's Gangrene? There are some steps you can take to lower your chances of getting Fournier’s gangrene: If you have diabetes, regularly check your genitals and surrounding areas for wounds or signs of infection, like redness and swelling. Keep your blood sugar at a healthy level. For people with diabetes, that means keeping up with your medications. If you're obese or overweight, try to lose some weight. Ask your doctor about the best ways to do this. If you smoke or chew tobacco, stop. To lower your risk of infection, wash any open wounds in the area with soap and water and keep them dry and clean until they heal. Keep your genital and anal areas clean and dry. Takeaways Fournier’s gangrene is a life-threatening infection. It usually starts with redness, swelling, and pain around your genitals or anus. If you have possible signs, it’s very important to see a doctor right away. Early treatment can save your life. FAQs What is the most common cause of Fournier’s gangrene? The most common causes are infections in your urinary tract or the area near your anus that make their way into other tissues. Is Fournier’s gangrene an STD (a sexually transmitted disease, also known as an STI, or sexually transmitted infection)? No. You can’t get Fournier’s gangrene from another person or pass it to someone else. Sexual  activity can play a role if it causes cuts in your skin when you have already have an infection. Is Fournier’s gangrene caused by poor hygiene? Poor hygiene doesn't cause the disease. But keeping your genitals and perineum clean can help lower your risk. Can you survive Fournier’s gangrene? Most people survive. Some small, older studies found death rates higher than 50%. But larger, more recent studies mostly show death rates in the 20%-40% range. The largest studies find even lower death rates of 7.5% to 16%. Getting clear answers is hard because Fournier’s gangrene is so rare. One thing is clear: The more quickly you get treatment, the more likely you are to survive."
40,Do I have a Broken Rib?,"Your ribs protect soft, fragile organs like your heart and lungs . Even though the rib bones are sturdy and are linked together by bands of muscles, it’s possible to break one or more ribs if you’re hit hard in the chest. Broken ribs are painful and can hurt with every breath. And if they’re broken badly they can seriously damage internal organs. There are several ways your ribs could be broken: A traffic accident Getting punched in your rib cage Contact sports -- football, hockey, or soccer, for example Repeated movements, like swinging a golf club, rowing or swimming Coughing very hard again and again A fall onto a hard surface Getting CPR Some conditions can lead to a broken rib without your being hit very hard, including: Osteoporosis (thin, brittle bones, usually linked to aging) Cancerous lesions that weaken bones How Can I Tell If I Have a Broken Rib? Sharp chest pain happens with a broken rib. But it’s different from a heart attack : If you touch the spot where your rib is broken, it will hurt more. Your chest will hurt more when you take a deep breath. The pain will get worse if you twist your body. Coughing or laughing will cause pain . There may also be bruising, depending on the cause. How Is It Diagnosed? Your doctor will give you an exam. They’ll ask you what happened and will touch the painful area. They’ll want to listen to your lungs when you breathe and watch your rib cage as your chest goes up and down. If your doctor suspects a rib fracture, they will want to get images of your chest. If the broken rib is caused by blunt trauma or a serious accident, they will want to make sure there’s is no other serious damage to internal organs. Your doctor might order one or more of these: X-ray. These catch 75% of all broken ribs. They can also show other problems, like a collapsed lung . CT scan . This type of image shows fractures that don’t appear on X-rays. Your doctor will want you to get one if they think the X-ray missed something. It can also show damage to soft tissue and organs, like your lungs, liver , spleen or kidneys . MRI . Like a CT scan, these images can show fractures that X-rays miss. They can pinpoint damage to soft tissue and organs. Bone scan . If you have a stress fracture to a rib, or a history of prostate cancer , this may do a better job of showing where the damage is. How Bad Can It Be? Many times, it’s just a crack or hairline fracture, and the rib doesn’t move out of place. But if more ribs are broken or if the fracture is from a serious injury, more problems are possible. A broken rib can have a jagged edge that juts into the chest cavity. There’s a chance that it can harm one of your organs: If you break a rib toward the top of your rib cage , the sharp end of the bone could tear or puncture an important blood vessel. If you break a rib in the middle of your rib cage , the sharp end of bone could puncture a lung. If you break a rib toward the bottom of your rib cage , the sharp end of the bone could cause damage to your liver , kidney , or spleen. What's the Treatment? Most broken ribs take about 6 weeks to heal. While you’re on the mend: Take a break from sports to allow yourself to heal without hurting yourself again. Put ice on the area to relieve pain. Take pain medicine like acetaminophen or ibuprofen . If you need something stronger, your doctor may prescribe something for you. Take deep breaths to avoid pneumonia . A lung infection is the most common thing you can get with rib fractures. Your doctor may give you a simple device to encourage you to breathe deeply. Don’t wrap anything tightly around your ribs while they’re healing. You don’t want anything to limit your breathing. If you have a more serious injury, you may need additional treatment or possibly surgery. For example, if your lung has been punctured by the sharp end of one of your ribs, you may need to have a procedure done to remove air or blood from inside your chest. Some people whose ribs are badly injured might need to have them repaired with metal plates, but this is rare."
41,Understanding Bone Fractures -- the Basics,"What Are Fractures? A fracture is the medical term for a broken bone. Fractures are common; the average person has two during a lifetime. They occur when the physical force exerted on the bone is stronger than the bone itself. Your risk of fracture depends, in part, on your age. Broken bones are very common in childhood, although children's fractures are generally less complicated than fractures in adults. As you age, your bones become more brittle and you are more likely to suffer fractures from falls that would not occur when you were young. There are many types of fractures, but the main categories are displaced, non-displaced, open, and closed. Displaced and non-displaced fractures refer to the alignment of the fractured bone. In a displaced fracture, the bone snaps into two or more parts and moves so that the two ends are not lined up straight. If the bone is in many pieces, it is called a comminuted fracture. In a non-displaced fracture, the bone cracks either part or all of the way through, but does move and maintains its proper alignment. A closed fracture is when the bone breaks but there is no puncture or open wound in the skin . An open fracture is one in which the bone breaks through the skin ; it may then recede back into the wound and not be visible through the skin. This is an important difference from a closed fracture because with an open fracture there is a risk of a deep bone infection. Because of the unique properties of their bones, there are some defined fracture subtypes that present only in children. For example: A greenstick fracture in which the bone is bent, but not broken all the way through A buckle fracture results from compression of two bones driven into each other. A growth plate fracture at the joint that can result in shorter bone length These fracture subtypes can present in children and adults: A comminuted fracture is when the bone breaks into several pieces A transverse fracture is when the fracture line is perpendicular to the shaft (long part) of the bone. An oblique fracture is when the break is on an angle through the bone A pathologic fracture is caused by a disease that weakens the bone A stress fracture is a hairline crack The severity of a fracture depends u pon the fracture subtype and location. Serious fractures can have dangerous complications if not treated promptly; possible complications include damage to blood vessels or nerves and infection of the bone ( osteomyelitis ) or surrounding tissue. Recuperation time varies depending on the age and health of the patient and the type of fracture. A minor fracture in a child may heal within a few weeks; a serious fracture in an older person may take months to heal."
42,What Is Fragile X Syndrome?,"Fragile X syndrome is a condition that affects a child's learning, behavior, appearance, and health. Symptoms can be mild or more severe. Doctors also call it Martin-Bell syndrome. Boys often have a more serious form of it than girls. Children who are born with this genetic condition can get special education and therapy to help them learn and develop like other kids. Medicines and other treatments can improve their behavior and physical symptoms. What Are the Symptoms of Fragile X Syndrome? There are several, including: Trouble learning skills like sitting, crawling, or walking Problems with language and speech Hand-flapping and not making eye contact Temper tantrums Poor impulse control Anxiety Depression Obsessive-compulsive behaviors Extreme sensitivity to light or sound Hyperactivity and trouble paying attention Aggressive and self-destructive behavior in boys Trouble picking up on social cues Seizures Attention deficit disorder (ADD) Autism symptoms that affect communication and how they deal with other people Fragile X Syndrome and Autism More people with fragile X have autism compared to those without the condition. Fragile X can sometimes cause autism. And if your child has autism, they have a 2%-6% chance of also having fragile X syndrome. If your child has both fragile X and autism, they’re more likely to have seizures, sleep issues, more behavioral issues, and need more medications. Almost 80% of children with fragile X also have attention deficit disorder (ADD) or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Some children with fragile X also have changes to their face and body that can include: A large head A long, narrow face Soft skin Crossed or lazy eyes Low muscle tone A high-arched roof of their mouth Large ears A large forehead and chin Loose joints Flat feet Enlarged testicles (after puberty) Signs of fragile X usually start with delayed speech and language trouble by the age of 2. Boys are usually diagnosed around 35-37 months old. Girls are diagnosed around 42 months old. Symptoms are usually milder in girls. While most boys with fragile X have trouble with learning and development, girls usually don't have these issues. Girls with fragile X sometimes have trouble getting pregnant when they grow up. They might also go into menopause earlier than usual. This condition can also cause problems like: Hearing problems Vision problems Heart problems Sleep problems Obesity What Causes Fragile X Syndrome? The FMR1 gene, which is on the X chromosome, makes a protein called FMR that helps nerve cells talk to one another. A child needs this protein for their brain to develop normally. Children with fragile X make too little or none of it. People with this condition also have more copies than usual of a DNA segment known as CGG. In most people, this segment repeats five to 40 times. In people with fragile X, it repeats more than 200 times. The more times this DNA segment repeats, the more serious the symptoms are. A mother with the FMR1 gene change has a 50% chance of passing it to any of their children. A father can only pass it to daughters. Boys are more likely to have fragile X than girls, and they have more severe symptoms. This is because girls have two copies of the X chromosome. Even if one X chromosome has the gene change, the other copy can be fine. Boys have one X and one Y chromosome. If the X chromosome has the gene change, they will have symptoms of fragile X syndrome. Some people inherit the fragile X gene without having symptoms. They are called carriers. Carriers can pass the gene change to their children. What Are the Risk Factors for Fragile X Syndrome? The number isn’t clear, but about 1 in 8,000 to 11,000 females have fragile X syndrome, while 1 in 4,000 to 7,000 males have the condition. There aren’t any risk factors for fragile X that you can control. If you have the FMR1 gene, your child could have it, too. There’s no way to prevent fragile X syndrome. How Do Doctors Diagnose Fragile X Syndrome? These tests can be done during pregnancy to see if an unborn baby has fragile X: Amniocentesis -- doctors check a sample of amniotic fluid for the FMR1 gene change Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) -- doctors test a sample of cells from the placenta to check for the FMR1 gene After the child is born, a blood test can diagnose fragile X syndrome. This test looks for the FMR1 gene change. Babies born with fragile X syndrome don't always show signs of it. The doctor might notice that the baby's head is larger than usual. As the child gets older, learning and behavior problems can start. What’s the Treatment for Fragile X Syndrome? No medicine can cure fragile X. Treatments can help your child learn more easily and manage problem behaviors. Options include: Special education to help with learning (IEP and 504 are education plans that guide the school in providing support) Speech and language therapy Occupational therapy to help with daily tasks Behavior therapy Medicines to prevent seizures, manage ADD symptoms like hyperactivity, and treat other behavioral problems The earlier you start treatment, the better. Work with your child's doctor, teachers, and therapists to make a treatment program. Your child might also qualify for free special education services. What’s the Outlook for People With Fragile X Syndrome? The symptoms of fragile X aren’t life-threatening. Your life expectancy with the conditions is the same for anyone without it. A lot of people with the condition are able to live successful lives on their own. About 8 out of 20 women and 1 in 20 men with fragile X don’t need help with daily activities. People with the condition can go to school, have conversations, read books, learn new ideas, and finish other tasks by themselves. How Can You Find Support With Fragile X Syndrome? To learn more about fragile X, join a support group. Or reach out to an organization like the National Fragile X Foundation for advice and resources. There, you can learn about local events and groups for people with fragile X. There are also resources for parents. If you recently found out that your child has fragile X, this site offers many tips, videos, and firsthand experiences to help you understand how to care for them."
43,Understanding Frostbite: The Basics,"What Is Frostbite? Frostbite refers to the freezing of body tissue (usually skin ) that results when the blood vessels contract, reducing blood flow and oxygen to the affected body parts. Normal sensation is lost, and these tissues change color. Frostbite is most likely to affect body parts that are farther away from the body core and, therefore, have less blood flow. These include your feet, toes, hands, fingers, nose, and ears. There are three degrees of cold injury: frostnip, superficial frostbite, and deep frostbite. Although children, older people, and those with circulatory problems are at greater risk for frostbite, most cases happen in adults between 30 and 49. If you develop frostbite, you may not realize at first that anything is wrong, because the affected area may be numb. With prompt medical attention, most people recover fully from frostbite. However, if severe frostbite happens, permanent damage is possible depending on how long and how deeply the tissue was frozen. In severe cases, blood flow to the area may stop, and blood vessels, muscles, nerves, tendons, and bones may be permanently damaged. If the frozen tissue dies, the affected area may need to be amputated . What Causes Frostbite? Frostbite is usually caused by long exposure to cold temperatures, particularly if they are accompanied by a low wind-chill factor. It may also happen following more brief exposure to very cold temperatures. What Are the Symptoms of Frostbite? For frostnip: White patches of skin that are numb. For frostbite (superficial or deep): Skin that is white or grayish-yellow and feels hard, waxy, or numb, or is blistering or becoming darkened or black. Other symptoms include swelling, itching , burning, and deep pain during the rewarming/healing process. How Is Frostbite Diagnosed? Frostbite is initially diagnosed based on symptoms and a physical exam . Three to 5 days after rewarming, doctors will use imaging tests to determine how badly the tissue is  damaged. After 1 to 3 weeks, imaging will help find any damaged blood vessels and identify areas that may need to be amputated . What Are the Treatments for Frostbite? Most people recover completely from frostbite , though the affected area may be more sensitive to cold and sun damage and more likely to get frostbitten again. The first goal of treatment is to rewarm the affected area. Frostnip can be treated at home. If you think you may have frostnip, get out of the cold as soon as possible. If your clothes are wet, change into dry clothing. Soak the affected area in warm water (100 to 105 F) to thaw the frozen tissue. Don’t use hotter water because it may burn your skin . If warm water isn’t available, use your own body heat by, for instance, tucking your hands into your armpits or covering your nose, ears, or face with dry hands. CAUTION: Don’t rub the affected area because this may increase damage to the tissue. Don’t use a heating pad, heat lamp, stove, fireplace, or radiator to rewarm the affected area. These methods may warm your skin unevenly or may burn your skin, particularly if it’s numb and you can’t tell how hot it’s getting. If the skin tingles and burns as it warms, your circulation is returning. The skin may turn red, but shouldn’t blister or swell. If the skin doesn’t seem to warm, if it remains numb, or if it does blister or swell, seek immediate medical attention. Frostbite requires emergency medical care. If you think you may have frostbite, get out of the cold as soon as possible. If you can’t get medical help immediately and there's no risk that the area might be refrozen before you get help, warm the affected area as you would for frostnip. CAUTION: If the affected area might be refrozen before you get medical help, don’t warm it; this greatly increases the risk of damage. Also, don’t walk on frostbitten feet or toes unless it's absolutely necessary. At the hospital, frostbite is usually treated comprehensively because you can’t tell how bad it is in the first few days. Usually, patients need to be admitted for observation. Initially, the hospital staff will probably do the following: Rapidly warm the affected area in water for 15 to 30 minutes. Remove blisters that contain clear or milky fluid and cover them with a topical antibiotic, petroleum jelly, or aloe vera gel. Blisters that contain blood may not be removed. Splint and elevate the affected area and wrap it in a loose bandage. Administer ibuprofen to limit inflammation , tetanus toxoid to prevent tetanus infection, and antibiotics to prevent or treat infection. Narcotic drugs may be needed to treat pain as sensation returns. Later hospital treatment may include whirlpool therapy and physical therapy to promote circulation. Surgery, including amputation of the affected area, is sometimes necessary if the tissues are dead. That’s typically decided between 3 and 6 weeks after the injury. How Is Frostbite Prevented? The only way to prevent frostbite is to limit the amount of time you spend outdoors in extremely cold weather. But if you do go out, dressing right is a must: Layer up. Wear a synthetic fabric next to your skin. Cover that with a fleece and wool layer. Flowy layers keep warm air in, close to your body. Top it off with outerwear that wards off wind and water. Tuck in your toes. You’ll need two pairs of socks -- a synthetic pair underneath to wick moisture from your skin, topped by a pair made of wool or wool-blend. Foot warmers can work well, too. Make sure your footwear is waterproof and covers your ankles to keep snow and dampness out. Don’t forget your fingers. Mittens are your best bet to protect your digits from frostbite. If you prefer gloves, choose a cozy pair and try moisture-wicking glove liners under them. Heading out. A hat or headband made of fleece, heavy wool, or windproofing fabric is your best choice. Make sure it covers your ears. Add a face mask or scarf if the cold is extreme. It’ll protect your face and nose. It’ll warm the air you breathe in, too. You have a greater chance of getting frostbite if your clothes and footwear get wet. Make sure your layers stay dry. Here are some other frostbite prevention tips: H2O to go. Drink lots of water. Down at least a whole glass and eat a good meal before you venture out. Avoid alcohol. It makes you lose heat more quickly. Mind the clime. Trust your weather forecast, and note those wind-chill readings. Frostbite can attack exposed skin within minutes. Take along emergency supplies in case you can’t get back as quickly as you plan. Check in with friends. It’s best to be prepared, whether or not you think you’ll need help. Let people know where you’re headed and when you’ll be back. Keep it moving. Staying in motion while you’re out keeps your blood flow up and helps you stay warm. Don’t overdo it, though. You’ll need your energy in the cold."
44,Frozen Shoulder (Adhesive Capsulitis),"What Is Frozen Shoulder? Frozen shoulder can be painful but it usually gets better in time. (Photo credit: Ian Allenden/Dreamstime) Frozen shoulder, sometimes called adhesive capsulitis, is a condition that limits movement in shoulder joint. You usually have pain and stiffness that comes on gradually, gets worse, and then finally goes away. Your shoulder has three bones that form a ball-and-socket joint, including your upper arm (humerus), shoulder blade (scapula), and collarbone (clavicle). Strong connective tissue surrounding your shoulder joint holds everything together. This is called the shoulder capsule. With frozen shoulder, this capsule becomes so thick and tight that it’s hard to move. Bands of scar tissue form and there’s less of a liquid called synovial fluid to keep the joint lubricated. These things limit your shoulder motion even more. The condition is called “frozen” shoulder because as your shoulder gets more painful, you use it less. The less you use it, the thicker your shoulder capsule becomes, and the more difficult it is to use. So your shoulder feels “frozen” in place. Frozen Shoulder Symptoms The main symptoms of a frozen shoulder are pain and stiffness that make it difficult or impossible to move. Y ou’ll likely feel a dull or achy pain in one shoulder. You might also feel the pain in the shoulder muscles that wrap around the top of your arm. You might feel the same sensation in your upper arm. Your pain may get worse at night, which can make it hard to sleep . Stages of frozen shoulder You usually go through three phases with a frozen shoulder. Freezing stage: You have pain (sometimes serious) in your shoulder any time you move it. It slowly gets worse over time and may hurt more at night. Your shoulder movement is limited. This stage can last from 6-9 months. Frozen stage: Your pain might get better, but your stiffness gets worse. Moving your shoulder gets more difficult and it gets harder to do some daily activities. This stage can last 4-12 months. Thawing stage: Your range of motion starts to go back to normal. This can take anywhere from 5 months to 2 years. Frozen Shoulder Causes It’s not clear why some people get frozen shoulder, but some groups are more at risk. Frozen shoulder happens more often in women (and those designated female at birth). You’re more likely to get it between the ages of 40 and 60. Another major risk factor is being unable to move your shoulder for a long time. So your chances go up if you’re recovering from a medical condition like a stroke , or surgery like a mastectomy that keeps you from moving your arm. You're also at higher risk of you have reduced movement in your shoulder because of inflammation, like from rotator cuff tendinitis or bursitis. Certain medical conditions increase your risk. too. You may also be more likely to get frozen shoulder if you have diabetes. About 10% to 20% of people with diabetes get frozen shoulder. Other medical problems, linked to frozen shoulder include: Heart disease Thyroid disease Parkinson’s disease Frozen Shoulder Diagnosis There's no specific frozen shoulder test. To diagnose it, your doctor will give you a physical exam. You'll move your arm in different ways to see how much how it hurts. They may also move your shoulder for you and note the differences. They may inject anesthetic in your shoulder to numb the area so they can better judge your range of motion. This is called an injection test. A physical exam is usually all your doctor needs to diagnose frozen shoulder. But they might order imaging tests such as X-rays, ultrasound, or MRI to rule out other problems like arthritis or a torn rotator cuff. Frozen Shoulder Treatment Most of the time, frozen shoulder eventually gets better on its own, even it you don't treat it. Over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like aspirin or ibuprofen can help relieve the pain and inflammation in your shoulder. If they don’t help, your doctor might prescribe a stronger medication. If your symptoms are intense or don’t improve over time, your doctor might recommend other kinds of frozen shoulder treatment, including: A corticosteroid injection in your shoulder joint to reduce your pain and improve your range of motion. Joint distension . This means your doctor will inject sterile water into your shoulder capsule to stretch it. This can help you move your shoulder more easily. Physical therapy. While it's often used for frozen shoulder, it isn't always effective. It may be more useful during certain phases of frozen shoulder than others. Surgery. This is rarely necessary to treat frozen shoulder. But if other treatments haven’t helped, your doctor may suggest arthroscopic surgery (a less-invasive type of surgery that uses cameras and small tools) to remove scar tissue. Shoulder manipulation can help loosen up your shoulder tissue, but is very rarely used because arthroscopic surgery has better results. With this method, a doctor forcefully moves your shoulder while you're under general anesthesia. How to cure frozen shoulder quickly Unfortunately, there's no fast cure for frozen shoulder. But you might be able to ease some frozen shoulder symptoms with methods like: Hot/cold compression packs . Applying heat or cold to your shoulder can ease pain and swelling. Warm compresses increase blood flow to the inflamed area, while cold compresses slow blood flow and reduce swelling and pain. You can alternate between the two. For heat compression, warm a moist towel in the microwave or use a heating pad. Apply to your shoulder for up to 20 minutes, three times a day. For cold compression, wrap an ice pack or bag of frozen vegetables in a towel. Apply it to your shoulder every 2 to 4 hours for no more than 20 minutes at a time. If you're alternating the two, apply heat for 15 to 20 minutes. A few hours later, apply ice. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) . TENS therapy uses a low-voltage electrical current to block or change how you perceive pain. We need more research into how it might work. Some doctors think it may activate nerve cells that block pain signals. The current may also boost your body’s natural painkillers, a group of hormones called endorphins. The TENS device is about the size of a small smartphone. It has several sets of wires that connect to pads with adhesive backings that are placed on your skin along nerve pathways. The unit sends pulses of low electrical currents. It's usually done by a health care provider in their office or clinic. But you can also buy units you can use at home. Don't use one without checking with your doctor first. They're not recommended for people with certain health conditions, like heart disease or cancer . Exercises For a Frozen Shoulder Increasing the mobility in your shoulder with gentle stretching exercises can help to both treat and prevent frozen shoulder. It's a good idea to check with your doctor before trying any exercises for frozen shoulder. Go slowly, and modify or stop any exercise that's very painful. Before you get started, warm up your shoulder. The best way to do that is to take a warm shower or bath. Another option is to use a heating pad or a moist, microwaved towel. For the following exercises, stretch until you feel tension, but not so much that you’re in pain. Pendulum stretch . Stand with your arms at your side and your shoulders relaxed. Lean slightly forward, allowing your affected arm to hang. You can rest the hand of your good arm on a table for support, if needed. Swing your hanging arm in a circle about a foot in diameter 10 times in one direction and then 10 in the other direction. As your pain decreases and your mobility increases, make the circles bigger. As your symptoms improve, you can do the exercises while holding a light weight of no more than 3 to 5 pounds. Cross-body reach . Place the hand of your good arm on the elbow of your hurt arm. Lift your hurt arm up and across your chest until you feel the stretch in your shoulder. Hold for 15 to 20 seconds. Repeat 10 to 20 times a day. Towel stretch . Stand, holding each end of a 3-foot-long towel behind your back vertically, with your affected arm holding the bottom edge of the towel and your good arm holding the top edge. Slowly raise the unaffected arm up your back until you feel the stretch in your shoulder. Hold for 10 seconds. Do five times, twice a day for 5 days. Outward rotation . Stand with your upper arms against your sides and your elbows bent at a 90-degree angle. Hold each end of a rubber exercise band in each hand. Keeping your good arm still, gently pull the affected arm out to your side about 2-3 inches. Hold for 5 seconds. Repeat 10-15 times daily. Inward rotation . Stand next to a closed door. Loop one end of an exercise band around the doorknob and hold the other end in the hand of your affected arm. With your elbow at a 90-degree angle and your upper arm by your side, pull the band toward your body about 2-3 inches. Hold for 5 seconds, and repeat 10-15 times daily. How to Sleep With a Frozen Shoulder Here are some ways to make sleeping with frozen shoulder a little easier. Sleep with proper head and neck support . Whether you’re a back sleeper or a side sleeper, you need a pillow that keeps your head and neck in line with your spine . For side sleepers, this means a thicker pillow to lift your head. Back sleepers need a slightly lower loft, while belly sleepers need a relatively flat pillow. Sleep with extra pillows . The best sleeping position for a frozen shoulder is on your unaffected side with an extra pillow between your arm. This helps open your chest and keeps your shoulders aligned. If you don’t have a body pillow, put a smaller pillow in your armpit and hug it to avoid curling your shoulders inward. A pillow between your knees can help keep your hips and spine aligned and keep you from curling inward. Sleep with arms by your side . If you’re more comfortable sleeping on your back, rest your arms by your sides with your palms facing your mattress. This position puts the least amount of pressure on your shoulder joints and provides a gentle stretch to your shoulder muscles. Sleep with heat . Warm compresses increase blood flow and relieve pain in your shoulder. If you want to use a heating pad on your shoulder while you sleep, be sure it has safety features such as turn-off switch. You can also use a microwaveable buckwheat or weighted beanbag, which will gradually cool over time."
45,What Is Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome?,"Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is a rare reaction to antipsychotic drugs that treat schizophrenia , bipolar disorder , and other mental health conditions. It affects the nervous system and causes symptoms like a high fever and muscle stiffness. The condition is serious, but it’s treatable. Most people who get it make a full recovery when it’s found early. Causes NMS is very rare. Only about 1 to 2 out of every 10,000 people who take antipsychotic drugs get it. All antipsychotic drugs can cause NMS. The older antipsychotic drugs include: Chlorpromazine ( Thorazine ) Fluphenazine ( Prolixin ) Haloperidol ( Haldol ) Loxapine ( Loxitane ) Perphenazine ( Etrafon ) Thioridazine ( Mellaril ) Doctors call the newer antipsychotic drugs ""atypical antipsychotics."" They include: Aripiprazole ( Abilify ) Asenapine ( Saphris ) Brexpiprazole ( Rexulti ) Cariprazine ( Vraylar ) Clozapine ( Clozaril ) Iloperidone ( Fanapt ) Olanzapine ( Zyprexa ) Paliperidone ( Invega ) Quetiapine ( Seroquel ) Risperidone ( Risperdal ) Ziprazidone ( Geodon ) These drugs block a brain chemical called dopamine. That can make your muscles stiff and can cause rigid movements in people with Parkinson's disease . Any antipsychotic drug can cause NMS. But stronger drugs, like fluphenazine and haloperidol, are more likely to trigger it. NMS is more common in men than in women. You're also more likely to get it if you: Take a high dose of the drug Quickly increase your dose Get the medicine as a shot Switch from one antipsychotic drug to another Some drugs used to treat nausea and vomiting can also cause NMS, because they block dopamine. These include: Domperidone (Motilium) Droperidol (Inapsine) Metoclopramide ( Reglan ) Prochlorperazine ( Compazine ) Promethazine ( Phenergan ) People who take drugs for Parkinson's disease , like levodopa, can get NMS if they stop taking their medicine too quickly. Symptoms These often start within 2 weeks after you first take the medicine or have your dosage changed. Sometimes, they show up a few days after you start to take it. Or you might not have any until months later. NMS symptoms usually last for 7 to 10 days. They may include: High fever (102 to 104 F) Muscle stiffness Sweating a lot Anxiety or other changes in mental state Fast or abnormal heartbeat Quick breathing More saliva than usual NMS can damage muscles and cause very high or low blood pressure . If you’re not treated, you can get serious problems, like: Kidney failure Heart and lung failure Lack of oxygen in the body Infection in the lungs caused by breathing in fluid (aspiration pneumonia) More acid in the body Diagnosis Your doctor will look for the two main symptoms of NMS: a high temperature and stiff muscles. To be diagnosed with it, you also need to have a few other warning signs, like a fast heartbeat, low or high blood pressure, and sweating . Some other disorders have symptoms that are similar to NMS. To figure out if you have it, your doctor will do one or more of these tests: Blood and urine tests Brain imaging scans Test of spinal fluid EEG to find electrical problems in the brain Treatment Your doctor will first take you off the drug that caused this syndrome. Often, people with NMS get treatment in a hospital intensive care unit. The goal is to bring down your fever and give you fluids and nutrition. Medicines used to treat NMS include: Drugs that relax tight muscles, such as dantrolene ( Dantrium ) Parkinson's disease drugs that make your body produce more dopamine, such as amantadine ( Symmetrel ) or bromocriptine (Parlodel) If these medicines don't help, your doctor might try electroconvulsive therapy. During this treatment, you’re asleep and pain-free. A small electric current travels through your brain to trigger a seizure . This won’t hurt you, and it should help your symptoms. NMS usually gets better in 1 to 2 weeks. After recovery, most people can start taking antipsychotic medicine again. Your doctor might switch you to a different drug. NMS can come back after you’re treated. Your doctor will closely check for any signs of it. The longer you wait to go back on antipsychotic drugs, the less likely you'll be to get NMS again."
46,Ovarian Cysts,"What Is an Ovarian Cyst? Ovarian cysts are fluid-filled or semi-solid pockets in or on one of your ovaries. They’re common, especially when you're pregnant or haven’t gone through menopause yet. Most of the time, they don't hurt or cause any problems. You might get one every month as part of your menstrual cycle and never know it. Anyone who has ovaries can get an ovarian cyst. They usually go away on their own without treatment. A cyst can be a problem when it doesn’t go away, gets bigger, causes bleeding, or starts to hurt. There’s also a chance that an ovarian cyst is cancer , but that’s rare. Types of Ovarian Cysts Most cysts are “functional.” They’re a result of your normal menstrual cycle. These most often go away on their own within 2 to 3 months. Types of functional cysts include: Follicle cyst. Your ovaries usually release one egg with each cycle. It grows inside a tiny sac called a follicle. When the egg is ready, the follicle breaks open and releases it during ovulation. If the sac doesn’t open and keeps growing, it causes a follicle cyst. Corpus luteum cyst. After an egg is released, the empty follicle usually shrinks. The follicle also starts making hormones. At this point, the follicle is called the corpus luteum. If the opening where the egg got released is blocked, fluid can collect inside to make a cyst. Other ovarian cysts aren't functional. That means they don't form as a part of your menstrual cycle. These cysts don't always mean you have a disease you need to worry about. But your doctor might watch them to make sure they don't cause you any problems. These  cysts include: Dermoid cyst. These cysts form from cells that make eggs. They start when tissues from your hair, skin, or teeth collect inside your ovary. Also called a teratoma, these cysts are almost never cancer. Cystadenoma. The cells that cover your ovary can form this type of cyst. It usually contains watery fluid or mucus and can grow larger than other types of ovarian cysts. Endometrioma. Sometimes called chocolate cysts, these complex ovarian cysts are filled with dark brown fluid. They can happen when you have endometriosis. This is a condition in which tissue similar to the lining of your uterus grows outside of it, including in your ovaries. Ovarian cancer. Rarely, an ovarian cyst may be caused by cancer. Unlike other types of ovarian cysts, these are solid masses. You can also get a condition called polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), in which your ovaries make many small cysts with immature eggs in them. When you have PCOS, you may not have monthly periods and your ovaries may not release eggs regularly. Ovarian Cyst Symptoms Most ovarian cysts are small and don’t cause any problems. Cysts more often cause trouble when they get bigger. So what does an ovarian cyst feel like? Most of the time, they don't feel like anything at all. If you do have symptoms, signs of an ovarian cyst might include:: Pelvic pain or pressure Dull ache in your back Bloating or feeling full Nausea Swelling in your belly area Pain during sex Pain during your period A frequent urge to pee or poop The ovarian cyst pain location may be on one side of your lower belly or in your back. Ovarian cyst pain may be sharp or dull, and it can come and go. Most cysts go away on their own, but you may need to see a doctor if your cyst grows large, causes symptoms, or bursts. Symptoms of a burst ovarian cyst A cyst can break open, or rupture. You'll probably feel some pain when this happens, but you might not. You may notice some discomfort a few days after your cyst bursts, too. Sometimes, when ovarian cysts rupture, you'll have discharge that looks like vaginal spotting or bleeding. Symptoms of a burst ovarian cyst may include: Sharp, sudden pain in your lower belly or back Bloating that doesn’t go away Abnormal spotting or bleeding Sometimes when an ovarian cyst bursts, it's an emergency.  Get medical help right away if you have: Sudden, serious belly pain Pain with fever and throwing up Dizziness, weakness, or feeling faint Fast breathing Call 911 or go to the hospital if you have symptoms of internal bleeding from a burst ovarian cyst, including belly pain that gets worse or signs you've lost a lot of blood like dizziness or weakness. You may need surgery to control the bleeding. Difference between ovarian cysts and ovarian cancer Less than 1% of ovarian cysts are caused by cancer. Your odds are slightly higher if you’ve gone through menopause. But no matter your age or whether you can get pregnant, it can be hard to tell the difference between ovarian cysts and ovarian cancer from your symptoms alone. Ovarian cancer and cysts both can cause symptoms like: Bloating and pressure in your belly Urges to pee often Pain in your lower belly or pelvis Pain in your lower back Fatigue Changes in how often you poop, including constipation Losing weight for no known reason But with ovarian cysts, hair on your body and face sometimes grows in unusual ways. Ovarian cancer doesn't usually cause this symptom. Your doctor can take a closer look at your ovarian cyst with an ultrasound or other type of imaging. They may also order other tests. If they think you might have cancer, they may refer you to a specialist to learn more. Ovarian Cyst Causes The most likely cause of your cyst depends on several things, including whether you still have a regular menstrual cycle. If you still get your period, some common causes of ovarian cysts include: Ovulation. Most functional cysts happen when the follicle grows like it should but doesn’t break open to release the egg. Endometriosis. People who have endometriosis, especially advanced stages of the disease, can develop endometrioma cysts. Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). You may get pus-filled cysts on or close to your ovaries if you have a pelvic infection. Abnormal cell growth. You may get dermoid or cystadenoma cysts if cells in your ovaries grow in an abnormal way. Other causes of ovarian cysts when you still have menstrual cycles include: Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) Pregnancy Noncancerous growths Cancer If you’ve gone through menopause, your ovarian cysts may be from: Noncancerous growths Fluid in the ovary Cancer Ovarian Cyst Risk Factors Things that may make you more likely to get ovarian cysts include: Age. You're most likely to get ovarian cysts when you have a menstrual cycle. Cysts are less common in those too young to have periods and after menopause. Hormonal problems. You're more likely to get ovarian cysts if you have a medical condition that affects your hormones, such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Taking fertility drugs. For instance, using clomiphene ( Clomid ) to help you ovulate can increase your risk of cysts. Pregnancy. A cyst that forms during ovulation may stay on your ovary after you get pregnant and throughout your pregnancy. Endometriosis . Anyone with endometriosis can get ovarian cysts, but it's more likely if you have a serious case. A serious pelvic infection. If this spreads to your ovaries, it can cause cysts there. A previous ovarian cyst. If you’ve had an ovarian cyst before, you’re more likely to get others. Are Ovarian Cysts Dangerous? Usually the answer is no. But some people have ovarian cyst complications. Your ovarian cyst is more likely to lead to complications or need surgery if it gets bigger than 5 to 10 centimeters (from about the size of a lime to that of a grapefruit). Ovarian torsion. If cysts grow large, they can make the ovary move and twist. This twisting, called ovarian torsion, is very painful. It also can make you feel nauseous or throw up. Rupture. Cysts can break open, causing serious pain and bleeding, especially if they're large. Sex and other vigorous activities can make a rupture more likely. A ruptured cyst sometimes heals on its own, but it can be a  medical emergency. Infected ovarian cyst. An ovarian cyst can develop from a pelvic infection, forming an abscess . If the abscess bursts, dangerous bacteria can spread through your body. This could lead to sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition. Ovarian Cyst Diagnosis Sometimes, your doctor finds a cyst during a pelvic exam. They’ll ask questions about your pain and other symptoms. A cyst can be fluid-filled, solid, or mixed. To diagnose what kind you have, your doctor may recommend one or more of these tests: Pregnancy test . A positive pregnancy test may mean you have a corpus luteum cyst. Pelvic ultrasound . This uses sound waves to make an image of your uterus and ovaries. Your doctor can confirm that you have a cyst, pinpoint its location, and figure out what kind it is. Laparoscopy. Your doctor inserts a slim instrument with a light and a camera into your belly through a small cut. They can see your ovaries and remove any ovarian cysts. Blood test. If you have a partially solid ovarian cyst, your doctor may want to test your blood for levels of a protein called CA 125 ( cancer antigen 125). It’s often higher in women who have ovarian cancer and in those who have conditions such as uterine fibroids , endometriosis , and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Ovarian Cyst Treatment Most cysts go away on their own. Your doctor may suggest: Watching and waiting. Your doctor will monitor you over time to see if your cyst goes away or changes. Medicine. There isn't any specific ovarian cyst medication. But your doctor can give you medicine if you're in pain. They might also prescribe birth control pills or other hormonal treatment . Hormone treatments won’t make the cysts go away, but they can help prevent new ones. Surgery. Some ovarian cysts need surgery. That includes those that are large, don’t go away, or cause serious symptoms. You could also need surgery if you’re near or past menopause because your cysts are more likely to be cancerous. Your surgeon may decide to take just the cyst or the entire ovary. Surgeons use two types of surgery to remove ovarian cysts: Laparoscopy .  You're most likely to have this type of surgery to remove ovarian cysts. The doctor makes tiny cuts above or below your belly button. A small tool with a camera allows your doctor to see inside, and a different tool removes the cyst. You can probably go home the same day. Laparotomy. Your surgeon will make one bigger cut in your belly, so they can get to your ovary and cyst better. You're more likely to need this kind of surgery if you have a large cyst or doctors think it may be cancerous. Takeaways Many people with ovaries get fluid-filled cysts that come and go. Usually it's nothing to worry about, but tell your doctor if you have new symptoms of pelvic pain, bloating, heavy bleeding, or bleeding outside of your period. You may need surgery or other medical treatment for ovarian cysts that get bigger, cause symptoms, or don’t go away on their own. Get help right away if you have sudden, serious belly pain along with nausea, throwing up, fever, dizziness, or other signs of a burst ovarian cyst. Ovarian Cyst FAQs What are the first symptoms of an ovarian cyst? You may not feel anything, but people often get a sharp pain or feel pressure on one side of the body. How serious is a cyst on your ovaries? Ovarian cysts usually don’t cause big problems. But tell your doctor if you think you have one. Sometimes, they can grow large and cause pain or burst open. And some ovarian cysts make it harder to get pregnant. Rarely, ovarian cysts are cancerous. What are the serious symptoms of an ovarian cyst? You may feel sick to your stomach or throw up if a cyst moves your ovary out of place (ovarian torsion) or breaks open. An ovarian cyst that bursts may cause sudden, serious, one-sided belly or back pain. You may feel lightheaded or weak if a ruptured ovarian cyst causes internal bleeding. How worried should I be about an ovarian cyst? Ovarian cysts are common in people who have monthly periods. Most go away on their own and don’t pose a serious health risk. But tell your doctor about any new or ongoing symptoms of ovarian cysts, especially if you have constant bloating, lose weight without trying, or get sudden belly pain that gets worse or makes you feel sick, dizzy, or weak."
47,Carcinoid Syndrome,"What Is Carcinoid Syndrome? Carcinoid syndrome is a group of symptoms you might have with a type of cancer called carcinoid tumors. These tumors start in cells that make certain chemicals, and they release more of those chemicals into your bloodstream. The symptoms can be similar to those of other conditions like menopause or asthma . For example, there may be times when your skin suddenly gets red and warm, you have trouble breathing , or you have a rapid heartbeat. Carcinoid tumors usually grow in your stomach and intestines , but you can also get them in your lungs , pancreas , testicles, or ovaries . If you have carcinoid syndrome, it usually means the cancer has spread, most often to your lungs or liver . If your doctor finds a tumor early, they might be able to remove it. But other times, there’s no cure for carcinoid tumors. Treatments can help you live longer and better. You can also take steps to relieve the symptoms and feel more comfortable. Carcinoid Syndrome Causes Carcinoid syndrome happens because the tumors can make chemicals like hormones. When the cancer has spread to your liver, these chemicals can get into your blood . There, they can travel around your body and cause symptoms. The chemicals can go directly into your bloodstream if you have tumors in your lungs, testes, or ovaries. Carcinoid Syndrome Symptoms People with carcinoid syndrome may have: Skin that turns pink, red, or purple Small, widened blood vessels on their face Diarrhea Shortness of breath or wheezing Rapid heart rate Sudden drops in blood pressure Carcinoid Syndrome Complications Carcinoid syndrome can lead to other problems, including: Carcinoid heart disease . This can make your heart valves get thick and leak. Medicine can help, and in some cases, you may need surgery. Bowel blockage. A tumor in the lymph nodes next to your small intestine can block your digestion. This causes severe belly pain and vomiting. You might need surgery. Carcinoid crisis. Rarely, you might have a severe episode of blushing , trouble breathing , and confusion. This is an emergency that could be life-threatening, so get medical help right away. Carcinoid Syndrome Diagnosis If your doctor thinks you have carcinoid syndrome, they’ll do a physical exam and may ask you questions like: Have there been times when your skin suddenly got red and felt warm or burning? Do you often have diarrhea? Have you been short of breath? Do you sometimes wheeze? You may also need tests to look for a carcinoid tumor. Urine test . You collect your pee in containers over a 24-hour period. A lab will check it for high levels of hormones or what's left when your body breaks them down. Blood test. This could also show chemicals that the tumors release. Imaging tests . A CT scan is a series of X-rays that gives detailed views of the inside of your body. An MRI uses strong magnets and radio waves to make pictures of your organs. For radionuclide scanning, your doctor will inject you with a small amount of radioactive material, and your organs will absorb it. A special camera can spot the material and make pictures that help your doctor find a tumor. Questions for Your Doctor Where are the tumors that are causing my carcinoid syndrome? What kinds of tests will I need? What treatment do you recommend? Are there any foods I should avoid? What can I do to control my skin flushing? What other symptoms should I watch out for? Carcinoid Syndrome Treatment To treat carcinoid syndrome, your doctor will need to treat your tumors. You could have just one treatment or a combination of them. Surgery. Doctors may take out an entire organ that has tumors, such as your appendix , or remove only part of an affected area, such as a section of your bowel. Depending on where the tumor is, your doctor may also use an electric current to burn it off or cryosurgery to freeze it. Another option could be radiofrequency ablation. It uses a tool that sends electrical energy into the tumor to kill cancer cells. Chemotherapy . Strong medicines can often kill your cancer cells or slow their growth. You can take some of these drugs by mouth and get others through injections into a vein. Radiation . This treatment can destroy cancer cells or keep them from multiplying. The radiation can come from a machine outside your body, or your doctor may place a small amount of radioactive material inside your body, in or near the tumor. Liver directed therapy. This treatment kills cancer cells in your liver by blocking their blood supply. Your doctor threads a tube called a catheter into one of the arteries that carries blood to your liver. Then, they inject particles that block the blood flow to liver tumors. Biologic drugs. This type of treatment, which is also called immunotherapy , strengthens your body's defenses. Doctors inject drugs that help your immune system kill cancer cells. Drug therapy. Injected drugs such as lanreotide ( Somatuline ) and octreotide ( Sandostatin ) can help with skin flushing. They may also have a small effect on tumor growth. Telotristat ethyl (Xermelo) along with lanreotide or octreotide can help ease diarrhea. Lanreotide and octreotide attach to carcinoid cells and cut down on the amount of chemicals they make. Their side effects can include nausea , gallstones , and pain or bruising where you inject it. In some cases, doctors give octreotide with a medicine called interferon alfa to boost your body's response. Lifestyle Changes You can make smaller changes to curb the effects of carcinoid syndrome. For instance, avoid certain foods and drinks that can trigger symptoms: Alcohol Nuts Cheese Chili peppers Hot liquids It might take some trial and error to learn which are triggers for you. Your intestines could have trouble absorbing nutrients, which can lead to weight loss, weakness, and other problems. Try to eat a healthy diet, and ask your doctor whether you need to take vitamins or supplements. Carcinoid Syndrome Outlook Treatment might make the tumors go away. But the cancer may not be gone completely, or it could return. You may need regular therapy to keep it in check for as long as possible. If your treatment stops working, you can focus on making sure you're as comfortable as possible. This is called palliative care . Getting Support You don't have to face things alone. Consider joining a support group where you can you share your feelings with others who understand what it's like. Learn more about carcinoid syndrome and carcinoid tumors on the website of the Carcinoid Cancer Foundation. It also has information about how to join support groups in your area."
48,Getting Your Affairs in Order,"Most of us don't like to think about drawing up a will, signing ""do not resuscitate"" orders, or planning funeral services. So we don't. But when we're diagnosed with a life-threatening illness, these things suddenly take on a new urgency. In the midst of coping with the medical, emotional, psychological, and spiritual challenges of serious illness, mundane logistical details must be managed as well. And if you don't address them now, someone else will have to address them later. Before time begins to run short, it's important to make sure that you put everything in order as you would like it to be. What are the most important things you need in end-of-life planning? The must-do list: A will, advance directives, durable power of attorney for health care decisions, and funeral and burial/cremation preferences. Making a Will More than half of U.S. adults don't have a will. But you need one, even if you don't have a vast estate to distribute among your heirs. People who die intestate -- the legal term for ""without a will"" -- send their loved ones to court to navigate the probate process and to deal with dividing property while they're still grieving . And ask yourself this: Do you want to determine where your assets go, or do you want the state to do it? Writing a will isn't that difficult. There are a number of inexpensive online will writing programs. Better still, hire a family law attorney to help you draft one. The costs vary widely based on where you live and how much time your situation will require from the lawyer, but unless you have an enormous estate to divide, it shouldn't be bank breaking. In addition to stipulating where you want your property to go, your will or an accompanying document should also include papers outlining your plans for guardianship of minor children, if you have any. Advance Directives Sometimes called a living will, this document spells out the measures you would like taken, or not taken, to prolong your life. This document is legally binding. It's so important, WebMD has devoted a special article to advance directives. Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care Designating someone to have your power of attorney for health care does not mean you give up any power to make your own decisions. But there may come a point when you cannot speak for yourself. At that point, you will need someone to make decisions such as whether or not you would want to be kept alive on a ventilator. This person should have a copy of your advance directives, and should know your specific wishes regarding the kinds of lifesaving measures you do and do not want. Forms for assigning durable power of attorney for health care are available online. Instructions for Your Funeral or Memorial Service When someone has just died, grieving family members must often think fairly quickly about plans for funerals or memorial services. In the immediate aftermath of death, it can be hard to focus on details such as what your favorite song was or what kind of burial you would prefer. Sit down with someone you trust -- a social worker with your palliative care team can often help you brainstorm about important details -- and write down all the things that are important to you about your funeral, memorial service, and how your body is dealt with. Some questions to think about: Do you want a funeral or memorial service? In a church, synagogue, mosque, or somewhere else? Who should preside? What would you like to have read, sung, or said at your service? Is there someone you would particularly like to have speak? Would you like your body to be viewed after your death? By close family only? Would you like to record an audio or video message for a service after your death? How would you like your body to be dealt with? Do you prefer burial or cremation? How do you feel about organ donation or donating your body to medical research? Palliative Care Team Can Help For all of these and other end-of-life planning issues, your palliative care team can help you find a financial planner, attorney, or other professional who can make sure that your wishes are carried out and respected. It's also important to think about the personal side of estate planning, according to experts at, Capital Caring, which cares for more than 1,000 people living with advanced illness in the Washington, D.C. area daily. The experts say that before you appoint someone to carry out your health care power of attorney or to be the guardian of your children, you should ask the person first and talk through what the responsibilities will be and what your wishes are. Also, in addition to legal, financial, and health care matters, don't forget to plan for your emotional, psychological, and spiritual needs. In other words, make your ""bucket list."" A list like this isn't just about going skydiving or seeing the Pyramids. It's about the things that matter most to you and ensuring that they are taken care of before you die. For example, if your grandson is getting married or your daughter is graduating from high school, your list might include being strong enough to attend those events or, if that's not possible, recording a loving message or writing a letter to share with them on that day. When making all of these plans, the important thing is to talk openly with the people you love. Having those open conversations will help to make the transition easier and less painful for everyone. It will also help you deal with any unresolved issues."
49,Nail Fungus and Ingrown Nails,"Nail Fungus Nail fungus , or onychomycosis, is a condition that occurs when a microscopic fungus enters either a fingernail or toenail. Fungal infections occur in toenails more often than in fingernails. Anyone can get nail fungus , but infections are more common in people over age 60. For people who have diabetes or a weakened immune system, nail fungus can present serious risks. Leukonychia striata. Also called Mees’ lines, these chalky white horizontal streaks on the fingernail are the result of abnormal keratinization in the nail plate. In many cases, there is no obvious cause, but they could be the result of fever, trauma to the nail or malnutrition. The streaks usually grow out or resolve on their own. What Causes Nail Fungus? Usually, nail fungus occurs when fungus enters the nail through a small trauma (cut or break) in the nail. Nail fungus is not caused by poor hygiene. Nail fungus can be spread from person to person. It may be hard to determine exactly where or how a fungal infection is acquired. However, a warm, wet place (for example, a locker room) is a good place for a fungus to grow. What Are the Symptoms of Nail Fungus? A nail fungus infection can make nails thick and discolored. Uncommonly, you may feel pain in your toes or fingertips. How Is Nail Fungus Diagnosed? Your doctor may be able to tell if you have a nail fungus infection by looking carefully at your nails. They may scrape some debris from under a nail and look at it under a microscope or send it to a lab to determine what kind of infection you have. How Is Nail Fungus Treated? Treatment for a nail fungus may include topical creams, gels, nail lacquers, or oral medications (antifungal drugs). Rarely, surgery may be required. Although seldom done, removal of the infected nail can be performed to permit direct application of a topical antifungal. Oral drugs, such as terbinafine, can cure about one third of nail fungus infections. Toenail infections are more difficult to treat than fingernail infections because the toenail grows more slowly. In addition, a damp, warm environment of a shoe or boot can encourage fungal growth. How Can I Prevent Getting Nail Fungus? To prevent getting a nail fungus infection: Avoid walking barefoot in public areas, such as locker rooms. Keep the inside of your shoes dry and change socks frequently (100% cotton socks are recommended). Wear shoes that fit properly (shoes with a wide toe area and ones that don't press your toes). Use absorbent or antifungal powder. Ingrown Toenails Ingrown toenails can occur when the corner or side of the nail grows into the flesh of the toe. In many cases, ingrown nails occur in the big toe. The end result of this common condition is pain, redness, and swelling. Infection can occur in some cases. What Causes Ingrown Toenails? Some common causes of ingrown toenail include cutting the nails too short or not straight across, injury to the toenail, and wearing shoes that crowd the toenails. How Can Ingrown Toenails Be Treated? In mild cases, ingrown toenails may be treated with a 15-20-minute soak in warm water. Dry cotton can be placed under the corner of the nail. Talk to your doctor if you are experiencing increasing pain, swelling, and drainage of the area. Minor surgery can be performed to remove the part of the nail that is poking into the skin . How Can Ingrown Toenails Be Prevented? You can prevent ingrown toenails by: Wearing shoes that fit properly Keeping toenails at a moderate length and trimming them straight across"
50,Fissured Tongue,"If you have fissures in your tongue , it's likely no cause for concern. In fact, certain types of grooves or cracks are considered simply a variation of a normal tongue . Sometimes called a plicated or scrotal tongue , this condition is often harmless. However, it's rarely a good idea to diagnose yourself. So, if you have any concerns, set your mind at ease by discussing this with your doctor or oral specialist. Characteristics of Fissured Tongue These are the characteristics of a fissured tongue: Cracks, grooves, or clefts appear on the top and sides of the tongue. These fissures only affect your tongue. Fissures on the tongue vary in depth, but they may be as deep as 6 millimeters. Grooves may connect with other grooves, separating the tongue into small lobes or sections. Unless debris builds up in these fissures, you are unlikely to have any symptoms. Fissures may first appear during childhood. However, fissures are more common in adults. And, just as wrinkles can deepen with age, fissures can also become more pronounced as you get older. If you have regular dental exams, your dentist has no doubt spotted the fissures on your tongue. This is how most fissures are found. Conditions Associated With Fissured Tongue About 2% to 5% of the U.S. population has a fissured tongue. A fissured tongue may affect men slightly more often than women. Because a fissured tongue can cluster in families, it may be genetically inherited. Although other causes of fissured tongue are unknown, it may appear along with other conditions such as these: Geographic tongue, also known as benign migratory glossitis (BMG). This benign condition often shows up along with fissured tongue. It may cause no symptoms other than sensitivity to hot and spicy foods. Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome. This is a rare condition. It not only causes a fissured tongue, but also lip or facial swelling and paralysis in the face ( Bell's palsy ) that may come and go. Down syndrome . Fissured tongue occurs in as many as 80% of children with the chromosomal disorder Down syndrome. It is not common to need a biopsy of a fissured tongue. If a fissured tongue causes any symptoms, your dentist may encourage you to brush your tongue. This may help remove debris that has built up in deep fissures, causing irritation. In almost all cases, though, no treatment is needed. However, if you have symptoms or any complications of Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome, your dentist or doctor may recommend that you see a specialist."
