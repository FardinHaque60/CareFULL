0,Oral Lichen Planus,"What Is Oral Lichen Planus? Oral lichen planus is a long-lasting disease that affects your mouth with symptoms such as white patches, redness, and swelling. It doesn't go away, but you can keep it under control. It’s not contagious, but anybody can get it. Women are more likely to have it than men. It's most common in people older than 40. But kids and young adults can also get it. Oral Lichen Planus Causes Doctors aren't sure what causes oral lichen planus, but several things could play a part: It may run in your family. It could be linked to your immune system . Most of the time, your immune cells keep you safe by attacking bacteria and viruses. With oral lichen planus, some doctors believe, those cells get confused and attack the lining of your mouth . It could be linked to hepatitis C . Many people infected with the virus get it. Oral Lichen Planus Triggers Some things can set off the condition for the first time, or they can trigger it if you already have the condition. These include: Certain medicines, such as painkillers, high blood pressure treatments , diabetes drugs, and malaria medications A reaction to metal in your mouth, such as dental fillings Other mouth problems, such as having a rough crown or a habit of biting your cheeks or tongue Injury to your mouth Food allergy Infection What is certain is that you can’t pass it to anyone else and you didn't catch it from someone. Oral Lichen Planus Symptoms Symptoms can come on slowly or start all at once. You may start out with: Dryness A metallic, burning taste in your mouth Then you may see: White patches on your tongue , cheeks, and gums. They can be tiny dots or lines that make a lace-like pattern. Redness and swelling Peeling or blistering These sores may burn and be painful. They’ll likely hurt the most when you eat or drink foods that are spicy, salty, acidic (orange juice, tomatoes ), or alcoholic. Crispy treats and drinks with caffeine can also cause problems. Your doctor can diagnose oral lichen planus by taking a small piece of skin from inside your mouth. This is called a biopsy . They’ll run tests on it in the lab to see what the problem is. You may also need blood tests to rule out other conditions. Oral Lichen Planus Treatment If you feel only a slight roughness in your mouth, you may not need treatment. If you’re in pain or have sores, your doctor may suggest a corticosteroid cream. In rare cases, they might prescribe steroid pills. If your doctor suspects your immune system is causing your symptoms, they may suggest a medication that turns down its normal response. These include: Topical ointment or gel. Calcineurin inhibitors are medications that work somewhat like those you’d take after an organ transplant to help prevent your body from rejecting the new organ. But they come with an FDA warning because they may increase your risk of cancer . Systemic medications. You take these by mouth. Your doctor may prescribe them if you’re dealing with oral lichen planus in other parts of your body such as your scalp, genitals, or esophagus . Oral Lichen Planus Prevention Watch what you eat and drink. Certain foods and drinks -- especially spicy or citrus ones -- can make your symptoms worse. Hot or cold foods and drinks can also make you more uncomfortable. Stress can also make things worse. Get rid of any problems that could trigger oral lichen planus or make it worse: Have your dentist polish sharp teeth or replace damaged fillings or crowns. Talk to your doctor about changing medications that may be to blame. Brush twice a day, and floss daily. See your dentist twice a year for a cleaning and checkup. Use a mild toothpaste and a soft toothbrush . You also need to keep track of your symptoms and tell your doctor about any changes in your mouth. There's a slight chance that oral lichen planus can lead to oral cancer . Make sure to get a screening for oral cancer every 6 to 12 months. It's also important to enjoy a diet rich in fruit and vegetables. If you smoke, quit. Don't drink large amounts of alcohol . See your doctor regularly to look for any changes in your mouth."
1,What Is Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome?,"Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) is a disease of the gastrointestinal system. People who have ZES develop tumors known as gastrinomas in the pancreas and duodenum (the first section of the small intestine). The gastrinomas caused by ZES secrete the hormone gastrin. Because gastrin creates excessive stomach acid, 90 percent of patients with ZES develop stomach and duodenal ulcers. What Are the Complications of Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome? A person who has Zollinger-Ellison syndrome may have only one gastrinoma or may have several. Approximately 25% to 30% of ZES patients also have a genetic (inherited) disorder known as ""multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1,"" which also causes tumors in the pituitary and parathyroid glands. Another complication of ZES is that more than half of single gastrinomas are malignant (cancerous). These malignant gastrinomas can spread to other parts of the body, including the liver , lymph nodes, spleen , bones, or skin . What Are the Symptoms of Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome? People who have Zollinger-Ellison syndrome don't always have symptoms. When symptoms do occur, they include: Abdominal pain Burning pain in the abdomen Nausea Diarrhea Weight loss Vomiting Bleeding from the stomach Weakness Fatigue How Is Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome Diagnosed? If your doctor suspects that you have ZES, they will perform a blood test to look for high levels of gastrin (the hormone secreted by gastrinomas). They may also perform tests to measure how much acid your stomach is producing. Your doctor may examine you for gastrinomas by performing an endoscopy. This procedure is done with a flexible, lighted tube (an endoscope) that looks at your esophagus , stomach and duodenum. This is often done with endoscopic ultrasound to see the tumor. Other tests your doctor might perform include a CT scan, a special type of X-ray that provides cross-sectional images of the body, a PET scan to locate tumors, and an octreotide scan to look for neuroendocrine tumor cells. Despite these tests, gastrinomas can be difficult to find. How Is Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome Treated? ZES is treated by reducing the amount of acid your stomach produces. Medications called proton pump inhibitors are usually prescribed. These drugs, which include dexlansoprazole ( Dexilant ), esomeprazole ( Nexium ), lansoprazole ( Prevacid ), omeprazole ( Prilosec , Zegerid ), pantoprazole ( Protonix ), and rabeprazole ( Aciphex ), curb the production of stomach acid and allow the ulcers to heal. Treatment of ZES depends on whether the gastrinoma is sporadic or part of the inherited MEN I syndrome. While the latter is usually treated with acid suppression alone, sporadic gastrinomas are treated with acid suppression and surgical removal of the tumor. Somatostatin analogs such as octreotide, which suppresses hormone production, are also very good at controlling symptoms. If there is metastatic disease, you may be offered a combination of therapies including surgery, chemotherapy, or targeted drug therapy or radiation. What Is the Outlook for People with Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome? Gastrinomas tend to grow slowly and are not always malignant. The five-year survival rate depends on whether tumors are cancerous and if they've spread. If they have not spread to the liver , the 5-year survival rate may be 90%. If surgery removes the gastrinoma, 20%-25% of patients are completely cured. Treatment Follow-up for ZES If you have been treated for ZES, you should see your doctor on a regular basis to determine if the gastrinomas recur."
