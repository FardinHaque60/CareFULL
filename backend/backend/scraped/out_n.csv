0,Fungal Nail Infections,"['What Is a Fungal Nail Infection? A fungal nail infection is a common condition that can leave you with brittle, discolored nails, usually on your toes. Its formal name is onychomycosis, and it’s a lot like athlete’s foot. But instead of affecting the skin on the bottom of your feet or between your toes, it invades your nails. Fungi are tiny organisms you can only see through a microscope. Many different types can cause a nail infection. Sometimes they live on your skin and don’t make any trouble. But if you have a lot in one area, you might get infected. Don’t be embarrassed if you have toenail or fingernail fungus . It’s way more common than you think.', 'Types of Fungal Nail Infections There are 4 main kinds of fungal nail infection. Each looks slightly different: Distal or lateral subungual onychomycosis. This is the most common kind. It results from a fungus called a dermatophyte. You can get it in your fingernails or toenails. It starts in the nail bed, underneath the nail. You’ll see a yellowish colored area that spreads from the edges of the nail to the center, and places where it comes apart from the nail bed. White superficial onychomycosis. This is less common and only affects the nail surface, mainly on your toenails. It starts as white spots, which become powdery and cause the nail to crumble. Proximal subungual onychomycosis. This appears first as white spots in the center of the nail bed at the cuticle. They move outward as the finger or toenail grows. It’s rare and usually affects people who have immune system problems, like HIV infection. Candidal onychomycosis. Yeast causes this infection that usually affects your fingernails. The area around the nails is often swollen and inflamed, and the nails may come off entirely. It tends to happen to nails that have been damaged by an injury or another infection. A fungal nail infection occurs when a fungus attacks a fingernail, a toenail, or the skin under the nail, called the nail bed.

At first, you may only see a white or yellow spot under your nail. Over time, this spreads and can turn your whole nail white, yellow, green, or black. The nail may thicken and could be hard to trim. It may start to curl up or down or loosen from the nail bed. Your nail could become brittle and crumble when you touch it. Your nail may become misshapen. You may notice a bad smell. It’s easy to ignore fungal nail infections at first, since you may not have any pain . But if you don’t treat them, it can hurt to put any pressure on the area. If an infection gets bad enough, it could even become hard to walk.', 'Fungal Nail Infection Causes You get an infection when a crack in your nail or the skin around it allows fungus to get inside and grow. Since fungus thrives in dark, warm places, your toenails are more likely to be affected than your fingernails. Your toes also have less blood flow than your fingers, which makes it harder for your body to pick up on and prevent an infection. You’re more likely to get a fungal nail infection if you: Are a man Are older, since nails become more brittle and likely to crack as you age Have a weak immune system or ongoing health problems like diabetes Wear shoes that make your feet hot and sweaty Walk barefoot through gym showers, swimming pools, and locker rooms –places where fungus spreads easily Live with someone who has a fungal infection Have athlete’s foot, as the fungus that causes it can spread to your nails Recently had an injury or surgery on your nail, or had a previous infection Wear plastic gloves or keep your hands wet for long periods', 'See your doctor if you think you have nail fungus. You may need a prescription to treat it, whether that means taking a medicine by mouth or using a special cream. In serious cases, your nail may need to be removed so a healthy new one can grow in its place. Doctors can also use lasers to treat nail fungus.', 'Fungal Nail Infection Treatment See your doctor if you think you have nail fungus. It can be tough to get rid of, and you’re more likely to have success with a prescription. Treatments include: Oral antifungals. The doctor may give you a pill to kill fungus in your whole body. This is usually the best way to get rid of a nail infection. Treatment may last 2 months for an infection in your fingernails, or 3 months if it’s in your toenails. Topical antifungals. You rub or brush these medicines onto your nails. They may work for a mild infection, but they can’t get deep enough into the nail to cure a more serious one. You might use a topical treatment in combination with a pill. Surgery. If other treatments don’t work, the doctor may need to remove your nail entirely and let a healthy one grow back in its place. The new nail could also get infected. Laser or photodynamic therapy. Doctors are studying newer treatments that use special light to try to kill the fungus.', 'Fungal Nail Infection Prevention To prevent an infection, wash your hands and feet often. Use soap, and make sure you get between your fingers and toes. Also: Keep your fingernails and toenails short and trimmed straight across. Wear socks that wick away (absorb) moisture. If your feet sweat a lot, change your socks once or twice a day, or take off your shoes and let your feet cool when you have the chance. Use antifungal powder or spray on your feet as well as in your shoes. Throw away old pairs of closed-toe shoes since fungi might be living in them. If you get manicures at nail salons, visit only the ones that disinfect tools after each client. You can also bring your own file and clippers from home. Ask that your cuticles not be cut, since this can cause tiny breaks in the skin that let germs in. Don’t share towels if someone else in your family has nail fungus . This will pass around the infection.', 'Fungal Nail Infection Complications It can take a year or more for your nails to look like they did before the infection. And you may continue to have problems: The fungus can come back. Your nails may be permanently discolored or misshapen. The infection may spread to other parts of your body. It’s especially important to take care of a fungal nail infection if you have diabetes. You’re at greater risk of getting a serious skin infection.']"
1,Nail-Patella Syndrome,"['', '', 'Also known as hereditary osteo-onychodysplasia, nail-patella syndrome is a genetic disease that largely affects the development of your finger and toenails but can cause changes in the development of knees, elbows and the pelvis. Nails may be absent or underdeveloped and discolored, split, ridged, or pitted. It is caused by the LMX1B gene. Those with Nail-patella syndrome are also at risk for kidney disease and glaucoma.', 'Article: Nail Patella Syndrome Slideshow: Birthmarks: Port Wine Stains to Hemangiomas Slideshow: Tips to Keep Baby’s Skin Healthy Slideshow: Common Childhood Skin Problems: From Rashes to Ringworm Slideshow: What Your Nails Say About Your Health']"
2,Why Do I Bite My Nails and How Do I Stop?,"['About half of all kids and teens bite their nails. Many don’t grow out of it, either. If you’re an adult who bites your nails, you may have done it when you were younger and just never stopped. It could be your parents’ fault: Scientists aren’t sure if nail biting is genetic, but kids whose parents bite their nails are more likely to bite their nails, too. Studies show this happens even if the parents stop doing it before their child is born. Sometimes, nail biting can be a sign of emotional or mental stress. It tends to show up in people who are nervous, anxious or feeling down. It’s a way to cope with these feelings. You may also find yourself doing it when you’re bored, hungry or feeling insecure. Most nail biting is automatic -- you do it without thinking.', 'Reasons to Stop Nail biting won’t typically cause permanent damage. But it definitely has its downsides: It can make your nails grow in weird. If you damage the tissue around your nails, they may stop growing the way they should. This gives you abnormal-looking nails. It can spoil your smile. You can chip, crack, or break your teeth when you bite your nails. Over time, nail biting can even cause jaw problems. It can make you sick. Hands are a hotbed for germs, and nails are their perfect hideout. When you’re putting your fingers in your mouth multiple times a day, it increases your chances of getting sick. Plus, the skin damage you can cause when you bite your nails creates an easy way for germs to get in.', 'Prevention You may not see a change overnight, but with a little time and effort, you can bust your nail-biting habit. Try these tips: Cut them short. If there’s not enough nail to grab with your teeth , it won’t feel as satisfying when you give biting a try. Coat them with a bad taste. There are special nail polishes with a bitter flavor you can paint on your nails. The terrible taste will make you think twice before chewing. Splurge on manicures . Spending money and time at a nail salon will give you both good-looking nails and a reason to keep them that way. Wear gloves. It may sound silly, but if you can’t get to your nails, you can’t bite them. If gloves won’t work for your daily schedule, you can look for stickers made to cover nails -- they can have the same effect. Find your triggers. Notice how you feel or what you’re doing when you bite your nails. Once you know what kicks you into nail-biting drive, you can try to find other ways to cope. Keep your hands or mouth busy. Find something to fiddle with -- a stress ball, a worry stone, or even a pen to click. Chew gum so your mouth has a job. Give your nail-biting energy another place to go.', 'If you’re having trouble with the cold-turkey approach, take it a little at a time. Set small goals for yourself. Try to stop biting the nails on your right hand for a week. Or start even smaller: Choose one nail not to bite, like your thumb. Once you’ve kept it up for a while, put another nail in the “no-biting” zone. Keep going until all your fingers are off-limits. If you still struggle after trying multiple methods, talk to your doctor about whether therapy’s a good option to help you get to the bottom of the problem and take nail biting out of the picture.']"
3,"Narcolepsy: Symptoms, Causes, Treatment","['What Is Narcolepsy? Narcolepsy\xa0is a brain and nervous system disorder that affects your ability to wake and\xa0sleep. People with\xa0narcolepsy\xa0have intense, uncontrollable daytime sleepiness. They may suddenly fall asleep at any time during any type of activity. In a typical sleep cycle, we enter the early\xa0stages of sleep, then the deeper stages, and finally (after about 90 minutes) rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. People with narcolepsy go into REM sleep almost immediately in the sleep cycle and sometimes while they’re awake. Type 1 narcolepsy comes with a sudden loss of muscle tone that causes weakness and makes you unable to control your muscles, called cataplexy. Type 2 is narcolepsy without cataplexy. In many cases, narcolepsy isn’t diagnosed and therefore isn’t treated.', 'Narcolepsy Symptoms Symptoms of narcolepsy usually develop over a few months\xa0and last for the rest of your life. What is the first sign of narcolepsy? Most of the time, excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS)\xa0is the first sign you have narcolepsy. In general, EDS makes it harder to do everyday activities, even if you got enough sleep at night. The lack of energy can make it hard to concentrate. You have memory lapses and feel depressed or exhausted.', 'Other symptoms of narcolepsy In REM sleep, we can\xa0dream\xa0and have muscle\xa0paralysis, which explains some of the other\xa0symptoms of narcolepsy: Cataplexy: This can cause problems ranging from slurred speech to total body collapse, depending on the muscles involved. It’s often triggered by intense emotions such as surprise, laughter, or anger. Hallucinations : These\xa0delusions\xa0can happen at any time and are often vivid and frightening. They’re mostly visual, but any of the other senses can be involved. If they happen as you’re falling asleep, they’re called hypnagogic hallucinations. If they happen when you’re waking up, they’re called hypnopompic\xa0hallucinations. Sleep paralysis: You may be unable move or speak while falling asleep or waking up. These episodes usually last a few seconds to several minutes. Disrupted sleep: You might have a hard time staying asleep at night because of things like vivid\xa0dreams,\xa0breathing problems, or body movements. Learn more about narcolepsy symptoms .', ""Types of Narcolepsy There are 2 main types \xa0of narcolepsy. Which type you have depends on whether cataplexy is among your symptoms: Narcolepsy type 1. About 20% of people with narcolepsy have type 1, which includes cataplexy. Cataplexy can be mild or so serious that it makes you fall to the ground. Narcolepsy type 2. Most people (80%) with narcolepsy have this type, which doesn't involve cataplexy. It's harder to diagnose than type 1."", 'Causes of Narcolepsy Experts don’t know what causes narcolepsy. They think it involves multiple things that come together to cause problems in your brain and disturb your REM sleep . Scientists are getting closer to finding genes linked to the disorder. These genes control the production of chemicals in your brain that may signal sleep and wake cycles. Some experts think narcolepsy may happen because your brain has a hard time making a chemical called hypocretin. They’ve also found problems in parts of the brain involved in controlling REM sleep.', ""Narcolepsy risk factors Risk factors for narcolepsy include your age. Narcolepsy usually begins between the ages of 15 and 25, but it can show up at any age. If you have a family history of narcolepsy, your risk of getting it is 20 to 40 times higher. Narcolepsy epidemiology About 1 in 2,000 people\xa0have narcolepsy. But experts think only about half of those who have it are diagnosed, since many other conditions cause daytime sleepiness. The condition is thought to affect males and females\xa0at the same rate. But some research has suggested it's more likely in men and those who were assigned male at birth."", 'Narcolepsy Diagnosis Symptoms of narcolepsy can look like those of other health problems. Your\xa0diagnosis\xa0might involve a\xa0physical exam\xa0and medical history. Your doctor might also ask you to keep sleep records to track of your symptoms and sleep times for a couple of weeks. Tests for narcolepsy Polysomnogram (PSG): This is done in a\xa0sleep disorder\xa0clinic or a sleep lab. It’s an overnight test that takes constant measurements while you’re asleep to record problems in your sleep cycle. A PSG can help reveal whether you go into REM sleep at unusual times in your sleep cycle. It can rule out other problems that might be causing your symptoms. Multiple sleep latency test (MSLT): This is also done at a special clinic or lab. The test takes place during the day to measure your tendency to fall asleep and find out whether certain elements of REM sleep happen at unusual times during the day. You’ll take four or five short naps, usually 2 hours apart. Lumbar puncture. You get this procedure, sometimes called a spinal tap, in a hospital or outpatient facility . A doctor or nurse uses a needle to remove a small amount of spinal fluid from your back. The fluid is then tested to check the levels of hypocretin. Low levels could mean you have narcolepsy. Learn more about how narcolepsy is diagnosed.', ""Narcolepsy Treatment There’s no cure for narcolepsy. But\xa0treatment\xa0can help ease your symptoms and improve your quality of life. Medications for narcolepsy Drugs your doctor can prescribe to treat narcolepsy include: Stimulants to treat sleepiness Antidepressants to treat problems with REM sleep Sodium oxybate\xa0(Xyrem,\xa0Xywav) to treat cataplexy Pitolisant\xa0(Wakix) or\xa0Solriamfetol\xa0(Sunosi) to help you stay awake for longer periods Learn more about drug treatments for narcolepsy. Alternative treatments for narcolepsy There's little evidence that any alternative or natural treatment can reduce narcolepsy symptoms. But some people have found that massage therapy\xa0improves their sleep patterns. Also, one small study found that meditation-relaxation therapy\xa0reduced how often people with narcolepsy had sleep paralysis. In this type of therapy, you learn techniques to reassure yourself, shift your focus, and relax your muscles. Always check with your doctor before you try any alternative treatment. Home remedies for narcolepsy Some lifestyle changes can also help with narcolepsy symptoms: Stay away from\xa0caffeine,\xa0alcohol\xa0and nicotine. Follow a regular\xa0exercise\xa0and meal schedule. Eat smaller meals more often instead of heavy meals. Control your sleep schedule. Try to go to sleep and wake up at about the same time every day. Schedule several daytime naps, each lasting 10-15 minutes.

But experts say that, on average, it takes 12 years\xa0longer for women to get a diagnosis than men. They also say narcolepsy tends to be under-reported in ethnic and racial minorities. One study\xa0found that Black Americans tended to get symptoms earlier in life and to have worse daytime sleepiness . That could mean the condition shows up differently in Black people than in other groups. We do know that Black people are more likely to\xa0have sleep disorders in general than other groups in the United States. Because sleep quality is so important to health, this is thought to contribute to overall health disparities."", 'Complications of Narcolepsy Narcolepsy can cause problems in several areas, including:', ""Safety When you have narcolepsy, everyday activities\xa0like driving, cooking, and operating machinery can become dangerous. It's essential to know what things make you more likely to become inattentive or fall asleep. If you have cataplexy , be aware of what tends to trigger it. Talk to your doctor about what you're capable of and the best ways to stay safe."", ""Work and school People with narcolepsy tend to have trouble focusing and staying alert, which can interfere with work and learning. Medication and lifestyle changes can help. Accommodations like a flexible schedule and scheduled nap times may also help you perform at your best. Relationships and social life Mental fogginess, daytime sleepiness, memory problems, and cataplexy can make social interactions awkward. You might also feel embarrassed about your condition, since many people don't understand it. It can help to talk to family members and friends about your condition and ask for their support and understanding. Heart health Untreated narcolepsy has been linked to high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and heart disease .\xa0People with narcolepsy are often deficient in the protein hypocretin, which helps lower blood pressure during sleep. Also, disrupted sleep is harmful to heart health."", ""Living With Narcolepsy Treating your narcolepsy can help you manage the condition. But even effective treatment won't eliminate all symptoms.\xa0Lifestyle changes and coping strategies are important, too."", ""Narcolepsy diet Some people report that low-carb diets, such as the Keto diet , help with their narcolepsy symptoms. But there's little research to back this up. Some diet changes that can help include: Follow a diet that helps you get to a healthy weight and stay there. People with narcolepsy are at higher risk for obesity. And extra weight can affect the quality of your sleep. Eat smaller, more frequent meals during the day to reduce drowsiness. Avoid big meals near bedtime so they don't interfere with sleep. Reduce processed foods and added sugar. Big changes in your blood sugar levels affect your energy levels. Be careful with alcohol and caffeine, which disrupt sleep patterns. Narcolepsy cost"", ""Narcolepsy can affect you financially as well as physically and emotionally. According to one study, medical costs for people with narcolepsy are about twice as much as for those without the condition. That includes medications as well as visits to the doctor's office and emergency room ."", ""Other extra costs you might face include: Lost time or lower pay at work Expenses due to delays and problems with education Managing narcolepsy To keep yourself safe and be as productive as possible, you need to be aware of your limitations.

Be open\xa0about your condition with those you interact with at work, school, and socially. Spend time outside\xa0or otherwise expose yourself to bright light during the day to help keep yourself alert. Tackle long or complicated projects in short bursts of time. Take a nap when you start to lose focus. If you feel sleepy while driving, pull over and take a nap. Tell your doctor if you notice any changes in your symptoms or side effects of your medication. Narcolepsy and your mental health People with narcolepsy are at higher risk\xa0of mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder. Not only are narcolepsy symptoms difficult to deal with, but disrupted sleep patterns are known to harm mental health. The stigma that narcolepsy often brings can increase feelings of shame and isolation. Some steps you can take to protect your mental health include: Join a support group for narcolepsy, where you can share your struggles and get ideas for dealing with symptoms. Ask your doctor to help you find a qualified counselor or therapist ."", ""Narcolepsy Prognosis Narcolepsy is a chronic (lifelong) condition.

You continue the activity while asleep and wake up with no memory of what you did.', ""Also, many other conditions can cause symptoms similar to those of narcolepsy. That's one reason narcolepsy is hard to diagnose. Other sleep disorders like insomnia and sleep apnea can cause daytime sleepiness. So can mental health conditions such as depression. Narcolepsy can also be mistaken for epilepsy or substance use disorder. A similar condition called idiopathic hypersomnolence (IH) also leads to sleepiness during the day. But unlike those with narcolepsy, people with IH tend to sleep for long periods (often 10-11 hours at a time) and have a very hard time waking up."", 'Takeaways Narcolepsy is a lifelong condition that affects almost every area of your life.

4,What Surgery Fixes a Perforated Nasal Septum?,"['You look at your nasal septum every time you glance in the mirror. Well, the front of it, anyway. It’s what divides your left nostril from your right. And it runs all the way up the inside of your nose. It’s made of cartilage in the front and bone in the back. If it’s perforated, that means you have a hole through part of it. It opens a path from one side of your nose to the other. A perforated septum doesn’t always cause any symptoms, but they can include nosebleeds , trouble breathing, and the feeling that your nose is blocked up. You might make a whistling sound as you breathe . About half the time, this happens after you’ve had surgery to fix a different problem in your nose. Other causes include: Cautery, a treatment for nosebleeds Certain diseases, including lupus , some cancers, syphilis , and tuberculosis Damage to your nose, like breaking it or even from picking it too much Infections Using drugs that go into your nose too often, ranging from over-the-counter nasal sprays to cocaine Surgery can sometimes fix a perforated septum, but it doesn’t always work, and it’s not always needed. In general, small holes are easier to fix than larger ones.', 'What Happens During Surgery? The procedure takes 1 to 3 hours, and you typically go home the same day. Usually, you get drugs to help you sleep through it. Some doctors use closed surgery, which means they go in through the opening in your nostrils. Others open up your nose for better access. There are all kinds of ways to do the fix. Your doctor will choose one based on where the hole is and how big it is, as well as their skills and experience. Typically, they’ll take tissue from your nose, or even your mouth , to cover the hole. Then they’ll put a flap of new tissue on each side of the hole. Some doctors think that’s all you need, while others add more support with bone, cartilage, or tissue from other parts of your body.', 'What’s Recovery Like? You’ll likely have thin splints in your nose to cover and protect the flaps. They’ll stay in for a week or two.', 'To protect your nose as it heals, it’s best to: Not lift heavy things or bend over Not pick your nose or blow it too hard Rinse with saline as often as your doctor tells you to Sneeze with your mouth open Stay away from contact sports Most of the time, you’ll feel back to normal within a few weeks. You’ll probably have a follow-up visit a week after surgery. Your doctor will: Check the splints and may take them out Clean out your nose if you have any crusting Make sure you’re healing well You might have another checkup at 2 weeks, then maybe at 6 and 12 weeks out. You usually know if it worked after 6 weeks.', 'When Should I Call the Doctor? As with any surgery, you need to keep a close eye on things as you heal. Call your doctor if you have: Bleeding Fever Lots of fluid draining from your nose Pain and swelling that get worse Redness on the outside of your nose Trouble breathing', 'How Do I Know If I Need Surgery in the First Place? Surgery isn’t usually the first step in treatment. Your doctor may suggest an ointment or a regular saline rinse. If those ease your symptoms, you still need to go for regular checkups because the hole could grow. If it gets too big, your nose won’t be as stable, and that may make the tip or middle of your nose start to droop. If those don’t work, your doctor might look for other problems in your nose, especially if your main symptom is that you feel a blockage. That could be caused by something else, and surgery may not help. You also need to understand what led to the hole. If it was caused by an ongoing issue, like a tumor, infection, or drug use, your doctor should treat that first. Then you can think about care for your septum.']"

Your doctor may use different methods to find out if you have fatty liver disease. Some of the things your doctor may use to diagnose fatty liver disease are: Health history and physical exam Your doctor will ask about your alcohol use. This information can help your doctor tell if you have ALD or NAFLD, so be truthful. They’ll also ask about medications you take, how you eat, and other health conditions you might have. Your doctor will also: Check your body for signs of liver problems such as an enlarged liver or jaundice Check your height and weight to calculate your body mass index (BMI). Your BMI determines how much you should weigh based on your height.', 'Blood tests Your doctor may order the following blood tests: Liver function and liver tests to detect and monitor liver disease and damage.

Lipid profile to measure blood fats, such as cholesterol and triglycerides Other blood tests to rule out other causes of FLD, like tests for hepatitis C and Wilson disease (a rare genetic condition) Hemoglobin A1c, which shows how stable your blood sugar is', ""Imaging tests You may get an ultrasound , computerized tomography (CT) scans, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These tests can show if there’s any fat in your liver. But they can’t tell whether you have simple fatty liver or NASH. There are some tests that can show whether you have fibrosis by measuring the stiffness of your liver. When liver cells die, they're replaced by scar tissue, which is stiff. The stiffer your liver is, the more scarring it has. Transient elastography measures liver stiffness using a special ultrasound machine. Magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) combines ultrasound and MRI to create a visual map of stiffness throughout your liver."", 'Liver biopsy Not everyone with NAFLD needs to have a liver biopsy. Your doctor may recommend it if you’re at risk for NASH or if other tests show that you may have NASH complications such as cirrhosis. A doctor removes a sample of tissue from your liver and sends it to a lab to see if you have liver inflammation or damage. You’ll get this done at a hospital or outpatient surgery center. Before the procedure, you’ll get medicine to help you relax or control pain. For the biopsy, your doctor numbs the area and uses a special needle to take a small piece of tissue from your liver. A liver biopsy is the only way for doctors to diagnose NASH.', 'Fatty Liver Disease Treatment There are no medications approved for NAFLD, though some are in clinical trials . Usually the first line of treatment is to lose weight . It helps reduce fat, inflammation, and scarring in your liver. Losing just 3% to 5% of your body weight can cut down on how much fat is in your liver. Weight loss surgery is also an option if you have a lot to lose. You’ll also need to quit drinking. It’s the only way you can keep liver damage from getting worse. You may even be able to undo some of the liver damage that’s already happened. Talk to your doctor about how you can get help. You may need a medically supervised detox program to safely quit drinking and manage withdrawal symptoms.', ""If you have complications due to NASH, such as cirrhosis or liver failure, you may need to have a liver transplant . In general, people with NASH who get a liver transplant do very well. Fatty liver disease alternative treatments Vitamin E . Studies have shown that vitamin E could improve liver health by reducing inflammation, but the results varied depending on the dosage, patient's age, and how overweight they were. Also, some studies showed that high does of vitamin E could be dangerous for people with other medical conditions as well as FLD. Coffee . Caffeinated coffee has long been thought to be good for the liver and linked to slowing down liver scarring in various liver diseases. It's not clear how coffee prevents liver damage. One theory is that coffee activates enzymes that detoxify the liver. Another is that coffee has compounds that lower inflammation. Olive oil . As a healthy fat, olive oil lowers the amount of fat stored in your liver, improves how your body deals with fats and sugars after a meal, and reduces inflammation."", ""All of these products are still being studied, so talk to your doctor or nutritionist before deciding to drink extra coffee daily or take extra olive oil or vitamin E. Reversing fatty liver disease Fatty liver disease can be reversed if you stop drinking liquor and lose some weight. The liver is one of the few organs in your body that can replace damaged tissue with new cells rather than with scar tissue. But that reversal only works if you don't keep drinking alcohol or eating the wrong foods."", ""Fatty Liver Disease Self-Care Lifestyle changes can help: Exercise more. Try to be active at least 30 minutes a day most days of the week. If you're trying to lose weight, you might find that it helps to exercise more than this.

6,Nasopharyngeal Cancer,"['Nasopharyngeal cancer is a rare type of head and neck cancer . It starts in the upper part of your throat, behind the nose. This area is called the nasopharynx. The nasopharynx is precariously placed at the base of your skull, above the roof of your mouth . Your nostrils open into the nasopharynx. When you breathe, air flows through your nose into your throat and nasopharynx, and eventually into your lungs . Nasopharyngeal cancer is also called nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).', 'Causes of Nasopharyngeal Cancer Scientists are not sure what exactly causes nasopharyngeal cancer. However, the cancer has been strongly linked to the Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ). Although EBV infection is common, not everyone who has EBV will get nasopharyngeal cancer. In the U.S., most people who have had an EBV infection never have long-term problems. Scientists are still researching how EBV leads to nasopharyngeal cancer, but it may be related to genetic material (DNA) from the virus affecting the DNA in the cells of the nasopharynx. The change in DNA causes cells to grow and divide abnormally, causing cancer . The risk for NPC goes up if you eat a diet rich in salt-cured fish and meat. Tobacco and alcohol may also increase the risk, although their link to NPC is not clear. Some scientists believe that chemicals in these things further damage the DNA in cells.', 'Who Gets Nasopharyngeal Cancer? Fewer than one in every 100,000 people in the U.S. gets this type of cancer , according to the American Cancer Society. The cancer is most common in southern China and southeast Asia. It is also much more common in: Other parts of Asia North Africa Inuit populations of Alaska and Canada Chinese and Hmong immigrant groups in the U.S. In the U.S., nasopharyngeal cancer has also been seen in African-Americans, Hispanics, and white people. You are more likely to get this type of cancer if you: Are male Eat a diet rich in salt-cured fish and meats Have a family history of nasopharyngeal cancer Have certain genes linked to cancer development Have come in contact with EBV Some, but not all, studies have found a higher risk of nasopharyngeal cancer in people who: Smoke Drink a lot of alcohol Work around wood dust or a chemical called formaldehyde', 'Nasopharyngeal Cancer Symptoms Symptoms of nasopharyngeal cancer may include: Lump in neck (most common) Blurry or double vision Ear infections that recur Face pain or numbness Headache Hearing loss , ringing in the ears , or a feeling of fullness in the ear Difficulty opening mouth Nosebleeds Stuffy nose Sore throat', 'Keep in mind, such symptoms are more likely to occur with many other diseases and health conditions that are far less serious than nasopharyngeal cancer. If you have any of the above symptoms, see your doctor. Only an experienced medical person can diagnose or rule out nasopharyngeal cancer.', 'How Nasopharyngeal Cancer Is Diagnosed Your doctor\xa0will ask you questions about your symptoms, medical history, and family history, and perform a physical exam. This includes a detailed look at your ears, nose, and throat. You may be sent to a doctor who specializes in these areas, called an otolaryngologist. The doctor or nurse will also feel your neck. Most patients with nasopharyngeal cancer have a lump in the neck. This is a sign that the cancer is spreading to the lymph nodes. A flexible, lighted tube may be placed through your mouth or nose to help the doctor better view the nasopharynx. This is called a nasopharyngoscopy. It helps the doctor check the area for abnormal growths, bleeding, or other problems.', 'If the exam is abnormal, your doctor may recommend a biopsy . A biopsy is the removal of a small amount of tissue for examination under a microscope. A biopsy may be taken during the nasopharyngoscopy. If there is a lump in your neck, the biopsy may be done by placing a very thin, hollow needle into the lump. Imaging tests can help spot nasopharyngeal cancer or determine if it has spread. Imaging tests may include: Chest X-ray CT scan MRI Ultrasound of the neck The following tests may also be performed: Complete blood count (CBC) and other blood tests EBV testing If you are diagnosed with nasopharyngeal cancer, other tests will be done to determine if and where the cancer has spread. This is called staging. Nasopharyngeal cancer is staged from Stage 0 (the earliest stage) to Stage IV (the most advanced stage). The lower the number, the less the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. Stage 0 is called carcinoma in situ. Stage I is early-stage nasopharyngeal cancer that has not spread to lymph nodes or distant parts of the body. Stage II is nasopharyngeal cancer that may have spread to nearby tissues and lymph nodes but has not spread to distant parts of the body. Stages III and IV are considered more advanced because of tumor size, extent of spread to nearby tissues, lymph nodes, and/or distant parts of the body. If nasopharyngeal cancer returns, it is called recurrent cancer.', 'Nasopharyngeal Cancer Treatment If you are diagnosed with nasopharyngeal\xa0 cancer, you will need regular follow-ups with your medical team before, during, and after treatment. Your treatment will depend on many things, including: Location of the tumor Stage of the tumor Your overall health Treatment may include: Radiation Therapy . Radiation therapy uses X-rays to kill cancer cells and stop them from growing. It is usually part of the standard treatment for early stage nasopharyngeal cancer. One type called IMRT delivers high-dose radiation directly to the tumor while minimizing damage to nearby healthy tissue. It may cause fewer side effects or complications than conventional radiation treatment to the nasopharynx, which can lead to: dry mouth inflammation of the lining of your mouth and throat blindness brain stem injury death of healthy tissue tooth decay Chemotherapy. Chemotherapy uses drugs to kill cancer cells. By itself, it is not usually helpful for treating nasopharyngeal cancer. But it may help you live longer when combined with radiotherapy or biological drugs.', ""Surgery . Surgery to remove the tumor is not often performed because of the tumor's location near nerves and blood vessels. It may cause permanent damage to the eye and other nearby structures. Not all people with nasopharyngeal cancer can have surgery. Your doctor will consider the location and stage of your tumor when discussing your treatment options. Biologic drugs . Biologic drugs affect how your body's immune system fights disease. They include monoclonal antibodies such as cetuximab (Erbitux), pembrolizumab ( Keytruda ), and nivolumab (Opdivo). Biologics work differently than chemotherapy drugs and may be used more often in cases of advanced or recurrent cancer. Palliative therapy . The goal of palliative treatment is to control symptoms related to cancer and cancer treatment and make you as comfortable as possible. Clinical trials . If treatment does not work, consider joining a clinical trial. Researchers are always testing new ways to treat cancer, and they need your help. Ask your doctor or nurse if there are any clinical trials on nasopharyngeal cancer in your area."", 'Can Nasopharyngeal Cancer Be Prevented? Many cases of nasopharygeal cancer are not preventable, but taking these steps may help lower your risk of nasopharyngeal cancer: Avoid salt-cured fish and meats. Do not smoke. Do not drink a lot of alcohol.']"
7,What Is Naturopathic Medicine?,"['Naturopathic medicine is a system that uses natural remedies to help the body heal itself. It embraces many therapies, including herbs, massage , acupuncture , exercise , and nutritional counseling. Naturopathy was brought to the United States from Germany in the 1800s, but some of its treatments are centuries old. Today, it combines traditional treatments with some aspects of modern science.', 'How Does It Work? The goal of naturopathic medicine is to treat the whole person -- that means mind, body, and spirit. It also aims to heal the root causes of an illness -- not just stop the symptoms. A naturopathic doctor may spend 1 to 2 hours examining you. They’ll ask questions about your health history, stress levels, and lifestyle habits. They may order lab tests. Afterwards, they will typically discuss your personal health plan . Naturopathic medicine focuses on education and prevention, so your doctor may give you diet, exercise , or stress management tips. They might use complementary medicine -- like homeopathy, herbal medicine, and acupuncture -- in addition to naturopathic treatments. They may also use touch, such as massage and pressure, to create balance in your body. This is called naturopathic manipulative therapy.', 'Who Practices It? You can find people who support naturopathic medicine in hospitals, clinics, community centers, and private offices. They fall into three groups, and they all have different educations and backgrounds: Naturopathic physicians: These are also called naturopathic doctors (ND) or doctors of naturopathic medicine (NMD). They usually attend an accredited four-year, graduate-level school. There they study basic sciences similar to those studied in conventional medical school. They also study nutrition , psychology , and complementary therapies such as herbal medicine and homeopathy. Some states and territories require naturopathic doctors to become licensed. That means they have to pass an exam to practice and take continuing education classes. Traditional naturopaths: These practitioners don’t attend an accredited naturopathic medical school or receive a license. Their education varies widely. Healthcare providers: Some medical doctors, dentists, doctors of osteopathy, chiropractors, and nurses have training in naturopathic medicine. Many are either NDs or they studied naturopathy. Before choosing a naturopathic practitioner, ask about their education or training and your state’s licensing requirements.', 'Will It Work for My Condition? Naturopathic medicine is used for a wide range of health issues. Some of the more common ones include: Allergies Headaches Fertility issues Digestive problems Obesity Hormonal imbalances Chronic pain Chronic fatigue syndrome In some states, licensed naturopathic doctors can perform minor surgeries, like stitching up a small wound. They can prescribe certain medications . And they might even serve as your primary care doctor. Naturopathic doctors may receive additional training in natural childbirth . You don’t have to be sick to try naturopathy. You may just want to boost your overall health or prevent an illness. Don’t use it for an emergency or issue that requires a visit to the hospital, like major surgery. Nor should it be used in place of conventional medicine for serious conditions, like cancer and heart disease .', 'Keep Your Doctor ‘in the Loop’ A few naturopathic treatments have known side effects and risks: Supplements (vitamin and herbal): Some of these may interfere with prescription medications. In large doses, certain vitamins may raise your risk of a disease like cancer . Spinal adjustments: As part of naturopathic manipulative treatment, your practitioner may apply pressure to your spine. This can damage arteries , nerves, bones, and spinal discs. In rare cases, it may lead to a stroke . Detox diets: These treatments are meant to rid your body of toxins. They involve cutting out certain foods or fasting . That means going for periods without eating. This can be dangerous for people with some chronic conditions, like diabetes . If you’re on the diet for a long time, you run the risk of not getting enough vital nutrients . Tell your doctor if you’re thinking about trying naturopathy. They can make sure the treatments are safe and don’t interact with any other drugs you’re taking. You shouldn’t stop or delay your conventional medical care because of naturopathic medicine.', 'Who Can Use It? It may be an\xa0option for people who might not find relief for their chronic illness through traditional medicine. In some\xa0cases, you can use both conventional and naturopathic medicine to treat an illness. For example, naturopathic remedies may help ease the side effects of chemotherapy . But remember to tell your regular doctor about any naturopathic treatments you’re on. And, you should tell your naturopathic doctor about your conventional medications. That way, both providers can work as a team for your health.']"

Ingesting something toxic A reaction to medicines Intense pain Emotional stress (such as fear) Drinking too much alcohol Using illicit drugs Overeating Reactions to certain smells or odors Vomiting in children Children are more prone to vomiting than adults. Some common reasons children vomit include: A viral infection Food poisoning A milk allergy Motion sickness Overeating or over-feeding Coughing Other illnesses that give the child a high fever', 'Vomiting in adults One common cause of vomiting in adults is gastroenteritis, a gut infection caused by bacteria. It\'s often called ""stomach flu,"" though it isn\'t a type of flu at all. Other common causes are: Pregnancy Food poisoning Migraines Labyrinthitis, an inner ear infection that makes you feel dizzy Motion sickness Appendicitis Chronic stomach conditions Some long-term stomach issues, such as food allergies and peptic ulcers, can cause vomiting. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) can also cause it, especially if you eat too quickly or too much, or eat certain foods. Both nausea and vomiting are side effects of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which happens when part of your gut becomes overactive. They\'re also symptoms of Crohn\'s disease, an inflammatory bowel disease that usually affects your intestines. Nausea and vomiting are triggered by stimuli in the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord.) (Credit: VectorMine/Dreamstime) Lifestyle choices Drinking too much can cause you to vomit, since alcohol irritates your stomach lining. Alcohol also increases stomach acid production and delays stomach emptying. Both these things can cause vomiting. Using too much marijuana, or taking other illicit drugs, may also lead to vomiting.', ""Overeating (eating even after you're full) can sometimes cause vomiting, too. Eating disorders Vomiting can be a sign of an eating disorder. People with anorexia have an intense fear of gaining weight and restrict how many calories they eat, sometime to a life-threatening degree. They may also use laxatives or make themselves vomit after eating. People with bulimia also have an extreme fear of weight gain. They eat excessive amounts of food in a short time (called bingeing) followed by vomiting or using laxatives. Other conditions Sometimes, vomiting is a side effect of serious illnesses like: Encephalitis Meningitis Some forms of cancer Heart attack Concussion or brain injury Brain tumor Bowel blockage (obstruction) Appendicitis, an inflammation of the appendix"", ""Nausea With Other Symptoms If you're trying to figure out what's causing your nausea, consider when it happens and what other symptoms you may have.

Other symptoms of COVID include a fever and a cough."", 'Nausea and headache If your nausea comes with a headache, you could be having a migraine. Some 60%-90% of people with migraines have nausea during an attack. Other migraine symptoms may include: Aura (visual or sensory symptoms like hallucinations, numbness, or muscle weakness) Sensitivity to light A change in mood or behavior. The nausea/migraine connection isn\'t clear. Some think there\'s a link between head pain and nausea. But often the nausea comes on well before the headache. You may also have nausea with other types of headaches, including those from hangovers. Pregnancy and nausea Nausea during the first trimester of pregnancy is extremely common. It\'s sometimes called ""morning sickness,"" though it can happen at any time of day. Scientists think it\'s brought on by an increase in a hormone called human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG). People with serious morning sickness, a condition called hyperemesis gravidarum, have higher levels of HCG than others.', 'Nausea after eating', 'Having nausea after eating could be a sign of: A bacterial or viral infection Food poisoning Food allergy Stress or anxiety Acid reflux Irritable bowel syndrome Overeating If you feel nauseated or if you vomit shortly after a meal, the cause may be food poisoning, gastritis (inflammation of the stomach lining), an ulcer , or bulimia . If it happens 1-8 hours after you eat, that may also indicate food poisoning . But certain foodborne bacteria, such as salmonella, can take longer to produce symptoms. Nausea and diarrhea Norovirus, also known as the ""stomach flu"" or ""stomach bug,"" is a very contagious virus that causes nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Norovirus can infect and sicken anyone. You can get norovirus when you eat food contaminated with it or touch someone or an object infected with it and then, for instance, put your fingers in your mouth. If you\'re having symptoms and they don\'t improve in 2 to 3 days, call a doctor. Can periods cause nausea? You might have nausea during your periods. This may be due to the changing hormones in your body. You might also get nausea if you have dysmenorrhea (very painful periods) or premenstrual syndrome (PMS).', ""Vomiting With Other Symptoms There are several reasons you could have vomiting along with other symptoms. Is vomiting a symptom of COVID-19? Like nausea, vomiting can be a sign of COVID-19. You'll usually also have respiratory symptoms, like coughing and trouble breathing. But in some cases, the only symptoms of COVID are digestive ones like vomiting and diarrhea. Vomiting and diarrhea Vomiting with diarrhea is often the result of either stomach flu or food poisoning. When you have both symptoms, the loss of fluids can put you at a higher risk of dehydration, which can be serious. Children and older people can get dehydrated quickly.

9,Colles' Fracture,"[""What is a Colles’ Fracture? A Colles' fracture -- or distal radius fracture -- is often called a ''broken wrist.''\xa0 In France it’s sometimes called a “Pouteau-Colles” fracture. Technically, it's a break in the larger of the two bones in your forearm. The bone breaks on the lower end, close to where it connects to the bones of the hand on the thumb side of the wrist. Colles' fractures are very common; they're the most frequently broken bone in the arm. In the United States, 1 of every 10 broken bones is a broken wrist."", 'Colles’ Fracture Symptoms Symptoms of a broken wrist can include: Pain, especially when flexing the wrist Tenderness Swelling Bruising Deformity of the wrist, sometimes called a “dinner fork deformity,” which causes it to look crooked and bent. To diagnose a broken wrist, your doctor will give you a thorough physical exam . You may need several sets of X-rays, since the fracture may be hard to see at first. Occasionally, a broken wrist can affect the nerves or blood flow. You should go to the emergency room if: Your wrist is in great pain. Your wrist, arm, or hand is numb. Your fingers are pale.', 'Colles’ Fracture Causes Usually, these injuries result from falling onto an outstretched arm or getting hit on the wrist. Broken wrists are common in people who play contact sports, as well as skiers, inline skaters, and bikers. People with osteoporosis or thinning of the bones are at particularly high-risk for wrist fractures. But they can happen to anyone who takes a fall or gets hit.', ""Colles’ Fracture Treatment If the broken wrist isn’t in the correct position to heal, your doctor may need to reset it. This can be pretty painful so it's usually done with anesthesia. However, painkillers will help afterward. You will probably also need: A splint , which you might use for a few days to a week while the swelling goes down; if a splint is used initially, a cast is usually put on about a week later. A cast , which you might need for 6 to 8 weeks or longer, depending on how bad the break is (you might need a second cast if the first one gets too loose after the swelling goes away.) Regular X-rays to make sure your wrist is healing normally"", 'Recovery You will probably also want to: Elevate your wrist on a pillow or the back of a chair above the level of your heart for the first few days. This will ease pain and swelling. Ice the wrist. Do this for 15 to 20 minutes every 2 to 3 hours for 2 to 3 days. Be careful to keep the splint or cast dry while icing. Take over-the-counter painkillers. Ask your doctor about nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ), like ibuprofen , naproxen , or aspirin (except for children). They can help with pain and swelling. However, these drugs have side effects, such as an increased risk of bleeding and ulcers. They should be used only occasionally unless your doctor specifically says otherwise, as this may delay healing. Practice stretching and strengthening exercises of the fingers, elbow , and shoulder if your doctor recommends them. Most of the time, these treatments will be enough. But sometimes, people with a broken wrist need surgery. Your doctor might suggest this if the bone is not likely to heal well in a cast. Sometimes, pins, plates, screws, or other devices are needed to hold the bone in place so it can mend.', ""Colles’ Fracture Outlook Of course, what you really want to know is when you can get back in the game after breaking your wrist. There's no easy answer. Here are some things to keep in mind during recovery from a broken wrist: It might take 8 weeks or longer for your wrist to heal. More severe breaks may not fully mend for 6 months. You and your doctor will decide when you are fully recovered. Don't rush back into your activity too soon. If you start working out before your wrist is healed, you could cause more serious damage. You may still have discomfort and stiffness in your wrist for months, or even years, after the injury. Follow your doctor's instructions for taking care of your cast. Remember that casts cannot get wet. See your doctor if the pain or swelling keeps getting worse after you get a cast or if you have numbness in your fingers."", 'Colles’ Fracture Complications If you get prompt treatment and good follow-up care for a Colles’ fracture, you can usually avoid complications.', 'Complications that can happen without quick treatment or with serious injuries include nerve or blood vessel injuries. Some people also develop compartment syndrome, a condition that happens when pressure in muscles gets dangerously high. These complications usually happen soon after the fracture. Complications that can happen later include carpal tunnel syndrome and osteoarthritis. Sometimes the fracture doesn’t heal in the right position, and this can cause tendon injury and ongoing pain. In more serious cases of Colles’ fracture, the following may happen: The break extends into the wrist joint. A piece of broken bone breaks through the skin . The bone is broken in multiple places. Bone pieces move out of place. Bone pieces injure a blood vessel or nerve. Ligaments may be torn. These types of broken wrists may be harder to treat.', 'Colles’ Fracture Prevention A broken wrist is tough to prevent, since it usually happens during an accidental fall. But it can help to use wrist guards during risky sports, like inline skating. Sometimes, a broken wrist can indicate osteoporosis , especially in women. Talk to your doctor about your risk factors for osteoporosis and fractures. There are steps you can take to improve your bone health.']"

Diabetes insipidus is a rare condition that causes you to have an almost unquenchable thirst and\xa0your body to make a lot of urine that is colorless and odorless. Most people pee out 1 to 2 quarts a day. People with diabetes insipidus can pass between 3 and 20 quarts a day. The main types of diabetes insipidus include central, nephrogenic, and pregnancy-related.', 'Diabetes Insipidus vs. Diabetes Mellitus Diabetes insipidus is a different disease from diabetes mellitus. Their names are similar, but the only things they have in common is that they make you thirsty and make you pee a lot. If you have diabetes insipidus, the hormones that help your body balance liquids don’t work. Only one in every 25,000 people gets this condition. With diabetes mellitus (often shortened to “diabetes”), your body can’t use energy from food like it should. It’s far more common. Around 100 million Americans have type 1 or type 2 diabetes .', 'Symptoms of Diabetes Insipidus Symptoms include: Severe thirst Peeing more than 3 liters a day (your doctor might call this polyuria ) Getting up to go a lot at night Peeing during sleep (bed-wetting) Pale, colorless urine Low measured concentration of urine Preference for cold drinks Dehydration Weakness Muscle pains Crankiness With dehydration, you might notice: Extreme thirst: often drinking more than 1 gallon of liquid per day Fatigue Feeling sluggish Dizziness Confusion Nausea Loss of consciousness', 'Symptoms in Infants and Children Many of the symptoms are similar in younger people. In infants, watch for: Crankiness Slow growth Poor feeding Weight loss Fever Vomiting In children, signs include: Drinking a lot of water Peeing often, sometimes every hour New bed-wetting or waking during the night to pee Dehydration Low energy', 'Diabetes Insipidus Causes Your body makes a hormone called vasopressin in a part of your brain called the hypothalamus . It’s stored in your pituitary gland. Vasopressin tells your kidneys to hold on to water , which makes your urine more concentrated. (Vasopressin is also called antidiuretic hormone or ADH.) When you’re thirsty or a little dehydrated, your vasopressin levels go up. Your kidneys absorb more water and put out concentrated urine. If you’ve had enough to drink, vasopressin levels fall, and what comes out is clear and diluted.', ""When your body doesn’t make enough vasopressin, the condition is called central diabetes insipidus . Anyone can get central DI, but it's not common. Only about 1 in every 25,000 people gets it. If you make enough but your kidneys don’t respond to it the way they should, you have nephrogenic diabetes insipidus . In either form, the result is the same. Your kidneys can't keep water, so even if you’re dehydrated, they'll put out a lot of pale urine."", 'Diabetes Insipidus Risk Factors Changes in the genes that you inherit from your parents can make you more likely to get diabetes insipidus. This happens in 1% to 2% of cases.', 'Types of Diabetes Insipidus Central diabetes insipidus. You get this when damage to your hypothalamus or pituitary gland affects how your body makes or puts out vasopressin. Your kidneys remove too much fluid from your body, and you pee more. This damage can result from: A tumor A head injury A blocked or bulging artery (aneurysm) Diseases such as Langerhans cell histiocytosis Infection Inflammation Surgery Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. You get this when your kidneys don’t respond to vasopressin and take too much fluid from your bloodstream. Doctors don’t always know why it happens, but some causes include: A blocked urinary tract Chronic kidney disease High levels of calcium in your blood Low levels of potassium in your blood Some medications, like lithium Gestational diabetes insipidus. This is very rare. You get this type only during pregnancy. Sometimes, a woman’s placenta -- the organ that gives oxygen and nutrients to your baby -- makes an enzyme that breaks down vasopressin. Other pregnant women make more prostaglandin, a hormone-like chemical that makes their kidneys less sensitive to vasopressin. Most cases of gestational diabetes insipidus are mild and don’t cause clear symptoms. The condition usually goes away after birth, but it might come back in another pregnancy .', 'How Is Diabetes Insipidus Diagnosed? Your doctor will do a physical exam . A checkup may not show any signs of central DI, except maybe an enlarged bladder or symptoms of dehydration . They’ll ask questions about your health history, including your family’s health. You might get a series of tests that include: Urinalysis. You’ll give a sample of your pee, and your doctor will send it to a lab to see whether it’s dilute or concentrated. They can also check for glucose, which can help them decide if you have diabetes insipidus or diabetes mellitus. You might need to collect your pee over a 24-hour period to see how much you’re putting out. Blood test. This will measure the electrolytes and glucose in your blood. This lets your doctor know if you have diabetes mellitus or diabetes insipidus. It may help them figure out which type. Fluid deprivation test . This measures the changes in your body weight , blood sodium, and urine concentration after you don’t drink anything for a while. There are two types: Short-form fluid deprivation test. You stop drinking for a short time. You collect a sample and take it back to your doctor, who sends it to a lab. Formal fluid deprivation test. You’ll have this done in a hospital so doctors can make sure you don’t get dehydrated. You’ll be weighed and give a sample every hour or two until: Your blood pressure drops too low or you have a rapid heartbeat when you stand You lose 5% or more of your starting body weight Your urine concentration goes up a little bit over two or three measurements MRI. This test takes detailed pictures of your internal organs and soft tissues. The doctor uses it to see if there’s a problem with your hypothalamus or pituitary gland. Genetic screening. Your doctor may suggest this test if your family members have had problems with making too much urine.', 'Complications of Diabetes Insipidus Diabetes insipidus that isn’t under control can make you more likely to have complications like: Dehydration. Diabetes insipidus makes it hard for your body to hold on to water. It’s easy to get dehydrated. Electrolyte imbalance. Electrolytes are minerals in your body with a tiny electric charge. When you lose too much water, your electrolyte levels can be abnormal. This might cause: A headache Feeling tired all the time ( fatigue ) Irritability Muscle pain Less sleep. Diabetes insipidus can lead to nocturia , a medical name for waking up in the night to pee. The result: a less restful night.', 'Diabetes Insipidus Treatment First, your doctor will tell you to drink plenty of fluids. That will replace the constant loss of water. Other treatments depend on which type you have: Central diabetes insipidus. You’ll take medications like desmopressin ( DDAVP ).\xa0Desmopressin controls urine output, maintains fluid balance, and prevents dehydration. You take it two or three times a day. It usually comes as a nasal spray, tablets, or injections. There are also treatments to help these drugs work better. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus can be harder to treat. If it’s caused by a drug, stopping the medicine helps. Other medicines may ease symptoms. These include indomethacin ( Indocin ) and diuretics like amiloride ( Moduretic 5-50 ) or hydrochlorothiazide ( Microzide ). Though diuretics typically make you pee more, in this case, they help you make less urine. Sometimes, this condition goes away if you treat the cause. Gestational diabetes insipidus. You can take desmopressin while you’re pregnant. Your problems should go away after you have the baby .', 'Diabetes Insipidus Outlook Diabetes insipidus doesn’t cause kidney failure or lead to dialysis . Your kidneys still do their main job, which is to filter your blood. But you will be more prone to dehydration. Make sure you always have something to drink close by, especially when it’s hot or when you exercise .\xa0Carry your medication with you, and avoid situations where you can\'t get water. It\'s also a good idea to wear ""medic alert"" jewelry, or keep a note with you about your condition, so that health care workers know about it.']"
11,What Is Myopia (Nearsightedness)?,"['Is it hard to see distant objects, like highway signs, until you’re a few feet away, but easy to read a book up close? Chances are you’re myopic, also known as nearsighted . It’s a pretty common condition that your eye doctor usually can fix with eyeglasses , contacts, or eye surgery.', 'What Causes Myopia? The structure of your eye is to blame. When your eyeball is too long or the cornea -- the protective outer layer of your eye -- is too curved, the light that enters your eye won’t focus correctly. Images focus in front of the retina, the light-sensitive part of your eye, instead of directly on the retina. This causes blurred vision . Doctors call this a refractive error. High myopia : It’s a more serious form of the condition, where the eyeball grows more than it is supposed to and becomes very long front to back. Besides making it hard to see things at a distance, it can also raise your chance of having other conditions like a detached retina , cataracts , and glaucoma . Degenerative myopia : Also called pathological or malignant myopia, it is a rare type you usually inherit from\xa0your parents. Your eyeball gets longer very quickly and causes severe myopia, usually by the teenage or early adult years. This type of myopia can get worse far into adulthood. Besides making it hard to see things at a distance, you may have a higher chance of having a detached retina, abnormal blood vessel growth in the eye (choroid neovascularization), and glaucoma .', 'Symptoms Chances are the only symptom is that more distant objects are blurred. You may also notice: Headaches Squinting Eye strain Eye fatigue when you try to see objects more than a few feet away Children with myopia often have trouble reading the blackboard at school.', 'Diagnosis and Treatment An eye exam can show you if you’re myopic. Glasses, contacts, or refractive surgery can usually correct the problem. When you have myopia, your prescription for glasses or contact lenses will be a negative number. The more negative the number, the stronger your lenses will be. For example, -3.00 is stronger than -2.50.', 'Your prescription helps the eye focus light on your retina. That clears up your vision . Eye surgery can improve your vision so much you may no longer\xa0need to wear glasses or contacts.\xa0The most common procedures for myopia are: Photorefractive keratectomy: Also called PRK, this surgery uses a laser to sculpt the middle layer of your cornea. That flattens the cornea’s curve and lets light rays focus closer to or on your retina. LASIK : This is the most common surgery for myopia. The surgeon uses a laser or another tool to create a thin flap on the top layer of your cornea. They sculpt the cornea with another laser and move\xa0the flap back into place. EVO Implantable Collamer Lens (ICL):\xa0Using a microscopic incision, a contact lens made of a soft, polmeric materialis implanted into your eye between you natural lens and your iris. It helps refract\xa0light on the retina, producing\xa0clearer vision. In the case of high myopia, special contacts or atropine eyedrops have been found to be effective in slowing the progression. In some cases, your doctor may suggest cataract or clear lens replacement surgery.', 'Does It Get Better Over Time? Myopia runs in families and will probably start in childhood. Multifocal lens (glasses or contacts) and eye drops such as atropine, pirenzepine gel, or cyclopentolate can help slow the progression. Your eyes usually stops changing after your teenage years, but not always. The incidents of myopia have\xa0been rising at an alarming rate in recent years. If you notice changes in your vision , get your eyes checked. See your eye doctor every year.']"
12,Pain Management: Neck and Shoulder Pain,"['Neck and shoulder pain can be classified in many different ways. Some people experience only neck pain or only shoulder pain, while others experience pain in both areas.', 'What Causes Neck Pain? Causes of neck pain include: Abnormalities in the bone or joints Trauma Poor posture Degenerative diseases Tumors Muscle strain', 'What Causes Shoulder Pain? The shoulder is a ball and socket joint with a large range of movement. Such a mobile joint tends to be more susceptible to injury. Shoulder pain can stem from one or more of the following causes: Strains from overexertion Tendonitis from overuse Shoulder joint instability Dislocation Collar or upper arm bone fractures Frozen shoulder Pinched nerves (also called radiculopathy)', 'How Are Neck and Shoulder Pain Diagnosed? X-rays: Plain X-rays can reveal narrowing of the space between two spinal bones, arthritis-like diseases, tumors, slipped discs, narrowing of the spinal canal, fractures and instability of the spinal column. MRI: Magnetic resonance imaging is a noninvasive procedure that can reveal the detail of neural (nerve-related) elements, as well as problems with the tendons and ligaments. Myelography/CT scanning: This is sometimes used as an alternative to MRI. Electrodiagnostic studies: Electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction velocity (NCV) are sometimes used to diagnose neck and shoulder pain, arm pain, numbness and tingling.', 'How Are Neck and Shoulder Pain Treated? The treatment of soft tissue neck and shoulder pain often includes the use of anti-inflammatory medication such as ibuprofen ( Advil or Motrin ) or naproxen ( Aleve or Naprosyn ). Pain relievers such as acetaminophen ( Tylenol ) may also be recommended. Depending on the source of pain, drugs like muscle relaxers and even antidepressants might be helpful. Pain also may be treated with a local application of moist heat or ice. Local corticosteroid injections are often helpful for arthritis of the shoulder. For both neck and shoulder pain movement, exercises may help. For cases in which nerve roots or the spinal cord are involved, surgical procedures may be necessary. Your doctor can tell you which is the best course of treatment for you.']"
13,What Is Necrotizing Enterocolitis?,"['Necrotizing enterocolitis, or NEC, is a serious disease that affects the intestines of (primarily) \xa0premature infants. It typically happens within the first 2 weeks of life in babies who are fed formula instead of breast milk. In this condition, bacteria invade the wall of the intestine. Inflammation sets in. This can create a crack or gap that allows nasty germs to leak into the abdomen . If not treated, it can lead to serious infection and death.', 'What Causes It? Doctors aren’t sure. They do know that premature infants have lungs and intestines that are weak and less mature than those of full-term babies. That means their bodies don’t move blood and oxygen around like they should. They also have problems breaking down their food and fighting infection.', 'Who’s At Risk Fortunately, NEC is not common. It affects just one in 2,000 to 4,000 births. It can happen in any newborn , but it’s most common in premature babies who weigh less than 3.25 lbs. Others who may be at risk include: High-risk or premature babies who are fed formula by mouth or tube Those who had a difficult delivery or have lowered oxygen levels Infants who have too many red blood cells in circulation Babies with existing gastrointestinal infections Seriously ill infants and those who’ve received a blood transfusion', 'What Are the Symptoms? They can differ from child to child. But an infant who has NEC will normally develop the following in the first two weeks of life: Swollen or bloated belly Feedings that stay in the stomach and don’t move through the intestines Green fluid in the stomach Bloody poop Trouble breathing , low heart rate , or sluggishness Other digestive conditions or medical problems produce similar symptoms to NEC. If your child develops any of those listed above, call your doctor.', 'How’s It Diagnosed? Your child’s doctor will take an X-ray of their abdomen and do some blood tests, usually in the neonatal intensive care unit. If it’s NEC, the X-ray will show gas or air bubbles in the wall of their intestine. Blood tests for infants with NEC show low white blood counts. That means your baby’s ability to fight infection is weakened.', 'What’s the Treatment? This will depend on a number of things, including how premature your baby is, their overall health and medical history, and how far the infection has spread.', 'Then, your doctor may do any of these things: Stop feedings Insert a tube through their nose and into their stomach to remove fluid and keep their stomach empty. Start IV fluids to keep them nourished and hydrated Give antibiotics to fight infection Take regular X-rays to monitor the condition Provide extra oxygen or a breathing machine if their belly is too swollen for them to breathe on their own Keep them away from other babies to stop the spread of NEC Once the infection is gone (typically in 5 to 7 days), your baby can start feeding again by mouth . If they don’t get better with treatment or they have a hole in their intestine, they’ll need surgery. This involves removing dead tissue and the parts of the intestine that have ruptured or are about to rupture. In the most serious cases, children who have surgery may need to have their intestine or bowel connected to an opening in the abdomen. Doctors call this an “ostomy.”', ""What’s the Outlook for NEC? Most infants with this condition fully recover. In some cases, the bowel is scarred or it narrows. This may lead to a future blockage. Babies who’ve had a large piece of their intestine removed in surgery may not be able to absorb nutrients normally. In the most severe cases, they may need a bowel transplant in order to live. Right now, there’s no way to prevent NEC. But studies show that babies who were only fed breast milk (no formula), were less likely to develop this disease. That’s why doctors recommend feeding at-risk infants breast milk, starting with small amounts.\xa0Many NICU's are now using donor breast milk when there is none available from the mother in order to reduce the incidence of NEC Researchers are working on promising new treatments for NEC. Among them: probiotics , which are live bacteria and yeasts that are good for you, to counteract the bacteria that cause the infection, and blocking nitric oxide. That’s a gas which is produced as a result of NEC. It helps to destroy the wall of the intestine.""]"
14,Necrotizing Fasciitis (Flesh-Eating Bacteria),"['What Is Necrotizing Fasciitis? Necrotizing fasciitis , also known as flesh-eating bacteria or flesh-eating disease, is a rare infection of the skin and tissues below it. ""Necrotizing"" means causing tissue death, and ""fasciitis"" refers to fascia inflammation, which is tissue under the skin. Necrotizing fasciitis is a form of necrotizing soft tissue infection (NSTI). These life-threatening infections affect the skin, muscles, and soft tissue and cause patches of tissue to die. It spreads quickly and aggressively in an infected person, causes tissue death at the infection site, and can be deadly if not treated right away. Every year, between 700 and 1,150 cases are diagnosed in the U.S. Up to 1 in 5 cases of necrotizing fasciitis result in death. It rarely happens in children. Necrotizing fasciitis spreads quickly and aggressively in an infected person. It causes tissue death at the infection site and beyond and can be deadly if not treated quickly. (Photo Credit: Juan Gaertner/Dreamstime)', 'Types of Necrotizing Fasciitis Necrotizing fasciitis includes two types: Type I, or polymicrobial. This type happens when more than one bacteria, usually a mix of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, cause the infection. Type II, or monomicrobial. The monomicrobial form is typically caused by one bacteria, group A streptococcus or Staphylococcus aureus bacteria.', ""Necrotizing Fasciitis Causes Necrotizing fasciitis is commonly caused by group A streptococcus (GAS) bacteria. That's the same type of bacteria that causes strep throat . But, several types of bacteria, including Vibrio vulnificus (bacteria that live in water), staphylococcus, and others, have also been linked to the disease. Necrotizing fasciitis happens when these types of bacteria infect the superficial fascia, a layer of connective tissue below the skin. Flesh-eating bacteria transmission The bacteria that cause necrotizing fasciitis can enter the body through: Surgical wounds Puncture wounds or an injury that doesn't break the skin Burns Minor cuts and scrapes Insect bites Abrasions In some cases, it is unknown how the infection began. Once it takes hold, the infection rapidly destroys muscle, skin, and fat tissue."", 'Necrotizing Fasciitis Risk Factors Having a weakened immune system and certain diseases may make you more likely to get necrotizing fasciitis. Health conditions that may raise your risk include: Alcohol abuse Cancer Chickenpox in childhood Cirrhosis (permanent liver damage) Diabetes Heart disease affecting the heart valves Chronic kidney disease Lung disease , including tuberculosis Peripheral vascular disease Steroid use Use of injectable or IV drugs In very rare cases, dental, tonsil, salivary gland, and sinus issues can cause facial necrotizing fasciitis.', 'Necrotizing Fasciitis Symptoms The early symptoms of an infection with flesh-eating bacteria usually appear within the first 24 hours of infection. Symptoms are similar to those of other conditions like the flu or a less serious skin infection. The early symptoms are also similar to common post-surgical complaints, such as: Serious pain , including areas other than the skin that look swollen or red Inflammation Fever Nausea Symptoms often include a combination of the following: Increasing pain in the general area of a minor cut, abrasion, or other skin opening Pain that is worse than would be expected from the appearance of the cut or abrasion Redness and warmth around the wound, though symptoms can begin at other areas of the body Flu-like symptoms such as diarrhea , nausea, fever, dizziness, weakness, and general malaise Intense thirst due to dehydration More advanced symptoms happen around the painful infection site within 3 to 4 days of infection. They include: Swelling, possibly along with a purplish rash Large, violet-colored marks that turn into blisters filled with dark, foul-smelling fluid Discoloration, peeling, and flakiness as tissue death ( gangrene ) happens Dizziness, fatigue, or nausea Critical symptoms, which often happen within 4 to 5 days of infection, include: A severe drop in blood pressure Toxic shock Unconsciousness', 'Necrotizing Fasciitis Bacteria Diagnosis Flesh-eating bacteria (necrotizing fasciitis) affects the body quickly, making early diagnosis important to survival. The doctor will examine you and review your symptoms. Having flesh-eating bacteria is a medical emergency, and if a doctor suspects you may have it, you’ll likely be admitted to a hospital and get tested there. Tests to diagnose flesh-eating bacteria (necrotizing fasciitis) include: Blood tests. People with flesh-eating bacteria have high levels of white blood cells. Tissue biopsy . You may need exploratory surgery to remove some of the tissue from the infected area. The tissue is sent to a lab to identify the particular bacteria that’s causing the infection. But you’ll be given some medicine to treat the infection before test results are back. CT scan . A CT scan can show your doctor where fluid and pus are collecting in the body. It also shows the presence of gas bubbles under the skin, which helps confirm the diagnosis. Household members and others who have had close contact with someone with necrotizing fasciitis should be tested for the disease if they have symptoms of an infection.', ""Necrotizing Fasciitis Treatment If you're infected with flesh-eating bacteria, you will get several types of treatment. The extent of treatment depends on the stage of the disease when treatment is started but can include: Intravenous (IV) antibiotic therapy Surgery to remove damaged or dead tissue in order to stop the spread of infection Medications to raise blood pressure Amputations of affected limbs, in some cases Hyperbaric oxygen therapy to preserve healthy tissue Cardiac monitoring and breathing aids Blood transfusions Intravenous immunoglobulin, which helps the body fight infection"", 'Necrotizing Fasciitis Complications Serious complications are common and may include: Sepsis Shock Organ failure Loss of an arm or leg due to amputation Severe scarring Death', 'Necrotizing Fasciitis Prevention Washing your hands with soap and water or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer is one of the best steps you can take to prevent flesh-eating bacteria and other skin infections. You can also prevent skin infections by taking these steps: After cleaning, cover an oozing, draining, or open wound with a clean, dry bandage. Get treated by a doctor if you have a serious or deep wound, such as a puncture or gunshot. Don’t go swimming or use a hot tub if you have an open wound or skin infection . There’s no vaccine available to prevent flesh-eating bacteria infection.', 'Necrotizing Fasciitis Outlook Early diagnosis and immediate, aggressive treatment are critical when it comes to fighting this rare skin infection. Many people need more than one procedure to remove damaged, infected tissue. If you have red, swollen skin and it’s not going away, make an appointment with your doctor.']"
15,What Is Fournier’s Gangrene?,"[""What Is Fournier's Gangrene? Fournier’s gangrene is a very serious, sometimes fatal infection in your genital or anal area. It’s a type of necrotizing fasciitis (flesh-eating disease) that develops quickly. Gangrene happens when body tissue is dead or is dying because it’s infected or isn’t getting enough blood. Fournier’s gangrene usually involves an infection that gets under the skin of the scrotum (the sac holding the testicles), the penis, or the perineum. The perineum is the area between the penis and the anus or between the vulva (the outer part of the vagina) and the anus. Under the skin, the infection spreads quickly and starts to destroy soft tissues surrounding your muscles, arteries, and nerves. In the worst cases, the dead or dying tissue can stretch to the thighs, stomach, and chest. Is Fournier's gangrene an emergency? Yes, Fournier’s gangrene gets worse quickly and can kill you, so it’s always an emergency. Fournier’s gangrene can be caused by many types of bacteria, including E. coli. Other causes could include group A streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. (Photo Credit: Getty Images)"", ""How Common Is Fournier's Gangrene? The disease is very rare. About 1.6 per 100,000 men and many fewer women or children get it each year. One study that looked at 10.7 million hospitalized men and boys found 2,238 cases of Fournier’s gangrene. The same study found just 49 cases in more than 15 million hospitalized women and girls."", ""Rates are highest in men over age 50. In the United States, it's most common in the South. It’s not clear how often people who get Fournier’s gangrene die from it. Some studies say the death rate could be as low as 7.5 %; most studies put the rate at 20% to 40%."", ""Fournier's Gangrene Symptoms What does Fournier’s gangrene feel like? The first thing you might notice is sudden pain or tenderness in the genitals or the area between the genitals and the anus (the perineum). Then you might start to feel sick all over. For example, you might feel tired, sick to your stomach, and get a fever. What does Fournier’s gangrene look like? If you have Fournier's gangrene, the skin on the affected body parts changes color. First, it’s red or purple, then bluish gray and, finally, black. These changes may be hard to see if your skin is dark."", 'Early symptoms of Fournier’s gangrene: Your penis, vulva, scrotum, or perineum looks red or purple.

Don’t wait to see if things get worse. Later symptoms of Fournier’s gangrene: These vary from person to person, but can include: Pain around the genitals or anus that gets worse Pain in your belly Color changes in the sore area A bad smell from the sore area Itchiness A popping sound when you rub the sore area Fever and chills A fast heart rate Low blood pressure Confusion Nausea and vomiting Low energy', ""Fournier's Gangrene Causes Fournier’s gangrene usually involves an infection with bacteria. The bacteria can get into tissues under your skin in several ways. These include: Urinary tract infections Bladder infections Surgery Abscesses, infected wounds that drain pus. You can get these near the anus or vulva. Genital piercings Insect bites Injuries during sex Any injury that causes a scratch or burn Circumcision in children"", 'Causes in women: If you have female anatomy, Fournier’s gangrene most often happens due to an abscess near your anus or on your vulva.

The most common found in people with Fournier’s gangrene include: Group A streptococci Staphylococcus aureus E. coli Pseudomonas aeruginosa', ""Fournier's Gangrene Risk Factors Fournier’s gangrene is most common in people who have a weak immune system or other health problems. You're more likely to get Fournier’s gangrene if you have: Diabetes. Between 20% and 70% of people who get Fournier’s gangrene have diabetes. But most people with diabetes won’t get Fournier’s gangrene. Alcohol misuse problems HIV infection Liver damage High blood pressure Kidney failure Obesity Heart disease Your risk also is higher if you're: Over 50 A smoker Getting chemotherapy Taking steroid drugs"", ""Fournier's gangrene can affect people of any age and gender. Some cases have been reported in infants. But the peak risk is in men ages 50-60. Because secretions can drain through your vagina, having female anatomy seems to lower risks."", 'Can diabetes drugs cause Fournier’s gangrene? The FDA has reported cases in people with type 2 diabetes who were taking certain drugs to lower their blood sugar. These drugs are called SGLT2 inhibitors and include medications such as canagliflozin (Invokana), dapagliflozin (Farxiga), empagliflozin (Jardiance), and ertugliflozin (Steglatro). It’s not clear why people taking those drugs might have a higher risk. One possibility is that the drugs increase the risk of urinary tract infections.', ""Fournier's Gangrene Diagnosis If your doctor thinks you may have Fournier's gangrene, they will ask about your symptoms and look at your skin. If you're in danger, you might start treatment without any other tests. If you do get tests, they could include: A computerized tomography (CT) scan that might help find where the infection is An ultrasound exam that can help rule out other problems that cause similar symptoms X-rays that look for gas in the damaged tissues. Gas is released from some of the bacteria that cause Fournier’s gangrene Blood tests to look for signs of infections and other clues"", ""Fournier's Gangrene Treatment The main treatments for Fournier’s gangrene are surgery and antibiotics. You may get surgery very quickly after diagnosis. The doctor will remove as much dead skin and tissue as possible to stop the damage from getting any worse. That kind of surgery is called debridement. You might need several of these surgeries to get rid of all the dead tissue. In rare cases, the entire penis and scrotum might be removed. You'll get antibiotics, drugs to kill the bacteria damaging your body. You may need several kinds of antibiotics. Instead of taking pills, you will get them through an IV, so that the medicine can get directly into your veins. That can kill the harmful bacteria more quickly."", 'Once the infection is under control, you can get reconstructive surgery. The goal will be for your body to look the way it did before the gangrene, if possible. You might also get something called hyperbaric oxygen therapy. That’s when you sit in a special room or lie in a tube with high oxygen levels. The oxygen can help heal wounds and stop bacteria from growing. Recovery from Fournier’s gangrene can take a while. You might spend several weeks in the hospital.', ""Complications of Fournier's Gangrene If Fournier’s gangrene isn't stopped in the earliest stages, you can get serious complications. These can include: Sepsis. When you have an extreme reaction to an infection, inflammation can spread through your body. This is a dangerous situation and can cause your blood pressure to plunge. The most extreme form of sepsis is called septic shock. Organ\xa0failure. Your major organs, like your kidneys, heart, and lungs, can stop working when you have sepsis. Blood\xa0clots. The inflammation can also make blood cells clump up in your arteries and veins. Blood clots can cause strokes and heart attacks. Complications for women: While women (and those identified as female at birth) are less likely to get Fournier’s gangrene, they often get sicker from it. For example, they spend more days in the hospital and are more likely to need help from breathing machines and other intensive care."", ""Outlook for Fournier's Gangrene You're more likely to survive Fournier’s gangrene than to die from it. \xa0But after the crisis, you might have some lingering problems. These can include: Sexual problems. You might, for example, lose feeling in your genitals and have problems with erections. Needing a colostomy bag. That’s a bag attached to your belly to collect poop when you can’t poop through your anus. Using the bag for a while may help you heal. Depression Digestive problems Urinary tract infections Ongoing pain You might need to see more than one medical specialist to deal with such issues and help improve your quality of life."", ""Can You Prevent Fournier's Gangrene? There are some steps you can take to lower your chances of getting Fournier’s gangrene: If you have diabetes, regularly check your genitals and surrounding areas for wounds or signs of infection, like redness and swelling. Keep your blood sugar at a healthy level. For people with diabetes, that means keeping up with your medications. If you're obese or overweight, try to lose some weight. Ask your doctor about the best ways to do this. If you smoke or chew tobacco, stop. To lower your risk of infection, wash any open wounds in the area with soap and water and keep them dry and clean until they heal. Keep your genital and anal areas clean and dry."", 'Takeaways Fournier’s gangrene is a life-threatening infection. It usually starts with redness, swelling, and pain around your genitals or anus. If you have possible signs, it’s very important to see a doctor right away. Early treatment can save your life.', ""FAQs What is the most common cause of Fournier’s gangrene? The most common causes are infections in your urinary tract or the area near your anus that make their way into other tissues. Is Fournier’s gangrene an STD (a sexually transmitted disease, also known as an STI, or sexually transmitted infection)? No. You can’t get Fournier’s gangrene from another person or pass it to someone else. Sexual \xa0activity can play a role if it causes cuts in your skin when you have already have an infection. Is Fournier’s gangrene caused by poor hygiene? Poor hygiene doesn't cause the disease. But keeping your genitals and perineum clean can help lower your risk. Can you survive Fournier’s gangrene?"", 'Most people survive. Some small, older studies found death rates higher than 50%. But larger, more recent studies mostly show death rates in the 20%-40% range. The largest studies find even lower death rates of 7.5% to 16%. Getting clear answers is hard because Fournier’s gangrene is so rare. One thing is clear: The more quickly you get treatment, the more likely you are to survive.']"
16,Fine Needle Aspiration,"['Fine needle aspiration is a type of biopsy procedure. In fine needle aspiration, a thin needle is inserted into an area of abnormal-appearing tissue or body fluid. As with other types of biopsies, the sample collected during fine needle aspiration can help make a diagnosis or rule out conditions such as cancer . Fine needle aspiration is generally considered a safe procedure. Complications are infrequent.', ""Fine Needle Aspiration: When It's Used A fine needle aspiration is most often done on swellings or lumps located just under the skin . A lump may be felt during a doctor's examination. Or it may be discovered on an imaging test such as: CT scan mammogram ultrasound Imaging tests may also discover abnormal spots deeper inside the body. Doctors may recommend fine needle aspiration for areas such as: cysts (fluid-filled lumps) nodules or masses (solid lumps) enlarged lymph nodes Without a biopsy, it's usually hard for a doctor to confirm what these abnormal areas contain. And you may not know if they are a threat to your health."", 'The most common reason to get a fine needle aspiration is to test for cancer. Most fine needle aspirations are done on these areas: breast thyroid gland lymph nodes in the neck, groin, or armpit Those types of fine needle aspirations are performed through the skin. Using endoscopy, doctors can also reach areas deeper in the body. An endoscopy uses a flexible tube with a light and camera attached. During an endoscopy, a doctor can do a fine needle aspiration on certain abnormal spots in the chest or abdomen .', 'What to Expect Before Fine Needle Aspiration There is no one standard preparation before fine needle aspiration. You may be asked to take these preparations: Changes in medicines. Several days before the test, stop taking aspirin or other blood thinners. These include clopidogrel ( Plavix ),\xa0warfarin (Coumadin or Jantoven), or one of the newer direct oral anticoagulants, such as apixaban (Eliquis) and dabigatran (Pradaxa). Changes in diet. Do not eat or drink anything for several hours before the procedure. If you will be getting sedating medication, be sure to bring someone with you to drive you home.', ""What to Expect During Fine Needle Aspiration Most fine needle aspirations are outpatient procedures. For people undergoing fine needle aspiration through the skin, here's what to expect: Your skin over the area of the procedure will be cleaned with antiseptic solution. It will then be covered with a sterile drape or towels. The area may be injected with a numbing medication under your skin. Ultrasound may be used during the procedure. This will help locate the right area for fine needle aspiration. A thin needle attached to a syringe will be inserted through the skin into the abnormal area. A vacuum inside the syringe causes body fluid or tissue to be suctioned (aspirated) into the needle and syringe. The fine needle aspiration itself is usually a short procedure (less than 10 minutes). The biopsy sample may be examined under a microscope right away. This will let your doctor: Verify that a good sample was obtained Make a rapid diagnosis Or, the biopsy sample may be sent to a lab for further testing. People undergoing fine needle aspiration during endoscopy will have additional preparation. Most will receive sedating medications. Endoscopic procedures usually take longer than fine needle aspirations through the skin (typically up to an hour)."", 'What to Expect After Fine Needle Aspiration If sedating medication is used during fine needle aspiration, you may be groggy and unable to work afterward. At the biopsy site, you may have some: swelling soreness pain In most people, over-the-counter pain medicines are enough to decrease discomfort. Examples include the generic drug acetaminophen . It is also sold under these brand names: Actamin Panadol Tylenol Final results of testing after a fine needle aspiration can take up to a week or longer. Preliminary results may be available sooner.', 'Complications of Fine Needle Aspiration Serious complications after fine needle aspiration are rare. Minor bleeding under the skin at the biopsy site can occur. This can result in a tender, swollen area called a hematoma. Infection at the biopsy site is rare, because sterile techniques and equipment are used for all fine needle aspirations. The risk of complications from fine needle aspiration during endoscopy is slightly higher. But it is still quite low for most people.']"
17,What Is Listeria?,"['It can happen to anybody -- you eat something and it doesn’t agree with you. You feel sick to your stomach , and you might come down with diarrhea . After a couple of days (or less in most cases), the trouble goes away and that’s the end of it. A possible source of the illness: listeria , one of the causes of food poisoning . It’s triggered by listeria bacteria that can live in soil, water , dust, animal poop , and other substances. You can get sick if you eat food that carries it. For most healthy people, the infection doesn’t pose much of a threat, even if it makes you sick for a day or two.\xa0Healthy people rarely become ill from listeria infection, but for some people, the infection can be serious or even life-threatening, particularly pregnant women and their babies, people whose immune systems aren’t working right, and seniors. If you belong to any of those groups, you need to be extra cautious.\xa0Prompt antibiotic treatment can help curb the effects of listeria infection.', 'What Causes Listeria? Listeria is caused by bacteria that can grow at cold temperatures, like those inside a refrigerator. Even freezing doesn’t stop it. When it contaminates food, you can’t see, smell, or taste it. People pick up the infection most often from deli meats that aren’t processed properly or from dairy products made from milk that isn’t pasteurized -- in other words, the milk hasn’t been heated to kill germs. Other common sources of outbreaks are: Cantaloupes Hot dogs Soft cheeses', 'Symptoms When you get a listeria infection, the signs typically include: Diarrhea Nausea Achy muscles Fever They could appear a few days after you eat the bad food, or they might take a couple of months to show up. If you have any of those symptoms, contact your doctor. If the infection spreads to your nervous system, it’s more serious. This severe form, called listeriosis, is fatal for 20% of people who have it. This happens most often with the very young, the very old, and people with weakened immune systems. The signs could be: Headache Stiff neck Confusion Loss of balance Convulsions', 'Go for emergency care or call 911 if you or a loved one have any of these symptoms. When you’re pregnant, you need to take special care because you have an increased risk of listeria in the blood . Call your doctor if you have: Headache Fever Achy muscles Back pain with or without diarrhea A mild case of listeria may need no treatment at all. For a more serious case, the doctor may use antibiotics .', 'Foods to Watch Out For There’s no vaccine to protect against listeria. So it’s important to be on guard. The main foods that can make you sick include: Raw vegetables contaminated by soil or by manure that was used as fertilizer Animal meat that is contaminated with listeria Milk that wasn’t pasteurized , and other products made from it Processed foods such as deli meats and hot dogs that are contaminated after they’re produced', 'How to Protect Yourself Be sure to wash your hands . Clean them well with warm, soapy water before you start cooking. If you handle raw meat or poultry, wash them afterward. Here are some other good ideas for cleaning, handling, and cooking food: Clean all kitchen surfaces, cutting boards, and utensils with hot, soapy water when you finish cooking. Scrub raw vegetables with a brush under running water. Cook meat, poultry, and egg dishes until they reach 160 F in the center. Use a meat thermometer to make sure. Keep uncooked meat and poultry away from other food. Use hot dogs within a week after you open the package, and deli and luncheon meats within 3 to 5 days after opening. Wash your hands with soap before handling a whole melon . Clean it with a brush under running water. Eat slices promptly. Throw out anything that sits at room temperature more than 4 hours. Keep the temperature below 40 F in the refrigerator , and below 0 F in the freezer .', 'People Who Should Be Extra Careful Pregnant women, and especially pregnant Hispanic women, are more likely than most people to come down with listeriosis.\xa0An infection, even one that affects the mother mildly, can have very serious effects on the baby , including premature birth or even stillbirth.', 'If a baby is born with listeria, symptoms might include: Little interest in feeding Fussiness Fever Vomiting Pregnant women and people in the other at-risk groups -- seniors and people whose immune systems are weak -- need to be especially careful. They should not eat: Hot dogs, cold cuts, or deli meats unless they have been heated to 165 F Refrigerated meat spreads or refrigerated smoked seafood. Foods that do not need refrigeration, such as canned tuna, are OK. Soft cheeses that are made from milk that has not been pasteurized. Some examples: brie, camembert, feta, queso panela, queso blanco and queso fresco. But if the label says specifically that the cheese is made from pasteurized milk, it’s OK.', 'Recalled Foods Just as cars might be recalled by their makers because of safety defects, companies that make and sell food sometimes have to recall it. News media report these recalls when they happen, and the federal foodsafety.gov website lists recalls on its home page. If you see a recall for food that you’ve eaten, watch for symptoms of listeria, and contact your doctor if you have any.']"

Although it’s a serious disease, finding and treating it early makes it more likely that you’ll be cured. No matter when you’re diagnosed, you can do certain things to ease your symptoms and feel better during your treatment. Most people who have renal cell carcinoma are older, usually between ages 50 and 70. It often starts as just one tumor in a kidney , but sometimes it begins as several tumors, or it’s found in both kidneys at once. You might also hear it called renal cell cancer . Doctors have different ways to treat renal cell carcinoma, and scientists are testing new ones, too. You’ll want to learn as much about your disease as you can and work with your doctor so you can choose the best treatment."", 'Causes Scientists aren’t sure exactly what causes renal cell carcinoma. They know that most kidney cancers start when something goes wrong in the genes in the kidney. No one can say for certain why that happens. Several things can raise your chances of getting the disease, like: Smoking Being very overweight Taking a lot of pain medicine, like aspirin , ibuprofen , or acetaminophen , for a long time Having hepatitis C Exposure to certain dyes, asbestos , cadmium (a metal), herbicides, and solvents Having acquired cystic kidney disease\xa0(especially in dialysis patients) Some inherited conditions, especially von Hippel- Lindau disease', 'Symptoms Early on, renal cell carcinoma doesn’t usually cause any symptoms. As the disease gets more serious, you might have warning signs like: A lump on your side, belly, or lower back Blood in your pee Low back pain on one side Losing weight for no clear reason Not feeling hungry Fever Feeling tired Not enough red blood cells ( anemia ) Night sweats High levels of calcium in your blood High blood pressure', 'Getting a Diagnosis Your doctor will want to find out more about your symptoms to figure out what’s going on. First, they’ll give you a physical exam and ask you questions like: When did you first notice a problem? Is there blood in your urine? Have you been having any pain? Where? Does anything make your symptoms better or worse? Has anyone in your family had von Hippel-Lindau disease? What about kidney cancer?', 'From there, they’ll do some tests that could include: Urine tests Blood tests Biopsy Tests to see how well your liver is working Ultrasound , which uses sound waves to make a picture of the organs inside your body CT scan , a test that uses a powerful X-ray to make detailed pictures inside your body Nephrectomy, when doctors remove part of one of your kidneys, or sometimes the whole kidney, to check it for renal cell carcinoma . You’ll have this test if your doctor has already spotted a tumor, but doesn’t know if it’s cancer . If the results show that you have renal cell carcinoma, your doctor will find out what stage it’s in, so you can decide on the best treatment options. The stage of cancer depends on how large your tumor is and whether the cancer has spread to other parts of your body. You may have tests to take a closer look inside your chest and belly, like: Chest X-ray CT scan MRI , which uses powerful magnets and radio waves to make pictures of the inside of your body Bone scan', 'Questions to Ask Your Doctor What stage is my cancer? What does that mean for me? Do I need any more tests? Do I need to see any other doctors? Have you ever treated this kind of cancer before? What kinds of treatments are there? Which would you recommend? How will those treatments make me feel? When should I start treatment? How will we know if it works? What will my recovery be like? What would you expect for me? Are there any clinical trials I can sign up for?', 'Treatment There are a few different ways doctors can treat renal cell carcinoma. You may need to try several before finding one that works. The best plan for you depends on the stage of your cancer, how healthy you are overall, and any side effects you might have. Your options may include: Surgery to remove part or all of the kidney Biologic drugs, which boost your body’s own defenses to fight cancer cells Drugs such as interferon -alfa or interleukin-2 Targeted therapy -- treatments that attack specific things cancers need to survive, like a tumor’s blood vessels or certain proteins; these include axitinib (Inlyta), bevacizumab ( Avastin ), cabozantinib ( Cometriq ), everolimus ( Afinitor ), lenvatinib ( Lenvima ), nivolumab ( Opdivo ), pazopanib ( Votrient ), sorafenib ( Nexavar ), sunitinib ( Sutent ), and temsirolimus ( Torisel ). Ablation. This uses extreme cold or radio waves to destroy tumors.', ""Many kinds of cancer are treated with radiation or chemotherapy , or sometimes both. These treatments usually don’t work well for renal cell carcinoma. In some cases, your doctor may still prescribe them to ease your symptoms or if other treatments haven’t worked. Talk with them about these options and how they might make you feel. Scientists also are looking for new ways to treat renal cell carcinoma in clinical trials. These trials test new drugs to see if they're safe and if they work. They often are a way for people to try new medicine that isn't available to everyone. Your doctor can tell you if one of these trials might be a good fit for you. It’s important to treat your disease, but also to make sure you're comfortable. Tell your doctor if you’re feeling any pain. They\xa0can give you medicines to ease your symptoms."", 'Taking Care of Yourself You can do things during and after your treatment to feel stronger physically and emotionally. Eat well. You need calories and nutrients to stay strong for treatment. If it’s hard for you to eat, try smaller meals every few hours instead of three big meals. Keep moving. Exercise is good for your body and your mind. Your treatment may leave you feeling tired, so be sure to balance activity with rest. Follow your treatment plan. Keep your doctor in the loop about any changes in how you’re feeling. Get support. It’s important to take care of your emotional health, too. Trained counselors and support groups can offer safe places to talk about how you and your loved ones feel. Also, ask for help from family, friends, and members of your community.', 'What to Expect Your outlook depends on the stage of your disease.

19,Diabetic Nephropathy,"['What Is Diabetic Nephropathy? Diabetic nephropathy -- kidney disease that results from diabetes -- is the number one cause of kidney failure. Almost a third of people with diabetes develop diabetic nephropathy. People with diabetes and kidney disease do worse overall than people with kidney disease alone. This is because people with diabetes tend to have other long-standing medical conditions, like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and blood vessel disease ( atherosclerosis ). People with diabetes also are more likely to have other kidney -related problems, such as bladder infections and nerve damage to the bladder . Kidney disease in type 1 diabetes is slightly different than in type 2 diabetes . In type 1 diabetes , kidney disease rarely begins in the first 10 years after diagnosis of diabetes. In type 2 diabetes , some patients already have kidney disease by the time they are diagnosed with diabetes.', ""What Are the Symptoms of Diabetic Nephropathy? There are often no symptoms with early diabetic nephropathy. As the kidney function worsens, symptoms may include: Swelling of the hands, feet, and face Trouble sleeping or concentrating Poor appetite Nausea Weakness Itching (end-stage kidney disease) and extremely dry skin Drowsiness (end-stage kidney disease) Abnormalities in the hearts' regular rhythm, because of increased potassium in the blood Muscle twitching As kidney damage progresses, your kidneys cannot remove the waste from your blood. The waste then builds up in your body and can reach poisonous levels, a condition known as uremia. People with uremia are often confused and occasionally become comatose."", ""How Is Diabetic Nephropathy Diagnosed? Certain blood tests that look for specific blood chemistry can be used to diagnose kidney damage. It also can be detected early by finding protein in the urine. Treatments are available that can help slow progression to kidney failure. That's why you should have your urine tested every year if you have diabetes."", 'How Is Diabetic Nephropathy Treated? Lowering blood pressure and maintaining blood sugar control are absolutely necessary to slow the progression of diabetic nephropathy. There are medications available which have been found to slow down the progression of kidney damage. They include: SGLT2 inhibitors including bexagliflozin (Brenzavvy), dapagliflozin ( Farxiga ), empagliflozin ( Jardiance ), and ertugliflozin ( Steglatro ), which help control high blood sugar. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors can help slow down the progression of kidney damage. Although ACE inhibitors -- including ramipril ( Altace ), quinapril ( Accupril ), and lisinopril ( Prinivil , Zestril ) -- are usually used to treat high blood pressure and other medical problems, they are often given to people with diabetes to prevent complications, even if their blood pressure is normal. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) can often be given instead\xa0if you have side effects from taking ACE inhibitors', 'If not treated, the kidneys will continue to fail and larger amounts of proteins can be detected in the urine. Advanced kidney failure requires treatment with dialysis or a kidney transplant.']"
20,Neurofibromatosis,"['What Is Neurofibromatosis? Neurofibromatosis is a genetic disorder of the nervous system . Tumors form on your nerve tissues. Mainly, neurofibromatosis disorders affect the growth and development of nerve cell tissue. The disorders are known as neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2). NF1 is the more common type of neurofibromatosis. Schwannomatosis has recently been identified as a third and more rare type of neurofibromatosis, but doctors don’t know much about it yet. You may also hear NF1 called Recklinghausen disease, von Recklinghausen disease, von Recklinghausen’s phakomatosis, von Recklinghausen’s neurofibromatosis, neurofibroma (multiple), neurofibromatosis- pheochromocytoma -duodenal carcinoid syndrome , or peripheral neurofibromatosis. It causes multiple café au lait spots (patches of tan or light brown skin) and neurofibromas (soft, fleshy growths) on or under your skin . It can also cause enlarged or deformed bones and curvature of the spine ( scoliosis ). Occasionally, tumors may develop in the brain, on cranial nerves, or on the spinal cord. About 50% to 75% of people with NF1 also have learning disabilities . Neurofibromatosis, neurofibromas. Neurofibromatosis is a genetic disorder of the nervous system which causes tumors to form on your nerve tissues. It causes multiple patches of tan or light brown skin and soft, fleshy growths known as neurofibromas to grow on or under your skin. NF2 is also called bilateral acoustic neurofibromatosis, vestibular schwannoma neurofibromatosis, or central neurofibromatosis. It’s much less common than NF1 and is characterized by multiple tumors on the cranial and spinal nerves. Tumors that affect both of the auditory nerves and hearing loss beginning in the teens or early 20s are generally the first symptoms of NF2.', 'Neurofibromatosis Symptoms Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) symptoms The following symptoms appear in people with NF1: Neurofibromatosis. Also called Recklinghausen’s disease, neurofibromatosis is characterized by areas of pigmentation like this café au lait spot on a 16-year-old. NF1 is a genetic disorder of the nervous system causing neurofibromas (tumors) to grow on the fibrous covering of nerves. Spots like this one can appear on the skin and can sometimes be accompanied by physical deformation. Most are benign but they can become malignant and those with NF1 have a predisposition to brain tumors and various forms of cancer. People with this disorder should seek genetic counseling before planning a child. Dermatologists look for more than six cafe au lait macules greater than 5mm in greatest diameter in pre-pubescent kids and greater than 15 mm in postpubertal people to initiate a workup for Neurofibromatosis 1. Several (usually 6 or more) café au lait spots Multiple freckles in the armpit or groin area Tiny growths in the iris (colored area) of the eye ; these are called Lisch nodules and usually do not affect eyesight . Neurofibromas that occur on or under the skin, sometimes even deep within the body. These are benign (harmless) tumors. But in rare cases, they can turn malignant or cancerous. Bone deformities, including a twisted spine (scoliosis) or bowed legs Tumors along the optic nerve, which may cause eyesight problems Nerve-related pain High blood pressure Osteoporosis Learning disabilities Large head size Short stature Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) symptoms People with NF2 often display the following symptoms: Loss of hearing Weakness of the muscles of the face Dizziness Poor balance Uncoordinated walking Cataracts (cloudy areas on the lens of the eye ) that develop at an unusually early age Headaches Schwannomatosis symptoms People with schwannomatosis may have the following symptoms: Pain from the enlarging tumors Numbness and tingling of the fingers or toes Weakness in the fingers and toes Chronic pain Loss of muscle', ""Neurofibromatosis Causes Neurofibromatosis: Crowe's Sign is freckling in the armpit of those with neurofibromatosis type I (von Recklinghausen's disease). Neurofibromatosis is a genetic disorder of the nervous system which affect the growth and development of nerve cell tissue. These freckles occur in up to 30% of people with the disease and their presence is one of six diagnostic criteria for neurofibromatosis. Freckles can also appear in the groin area, along the jaw and in the nape of the neck. Neurofibromatosis is often inherited (passed on by family members through your genes). But about 50% of people newly diagnosed with the disorder have no family history of the condition. That’s because it can result from a sudden mutation (change) in your genes. Once this change takes place, you can pass the mutant gene on to future generations. Mutations that lead to neurofibromatosis include: Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1): The NF1 gene on chromosome 17 makes a protein called neurofibromin that controls your cells’ growth. The mutation of this gene causes a neurofibromin loss and uncontrolled cell growth. Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2): The NF2 gene on chromosome 22 makes a protein called merlin or schwannomin. It suppresses tumors. Changes to this gene cause a loss of merlin and uncontrolled cell growth. Schwannomatosis: Mutations of the two known genes linked to schwannomatosis, SMARCB1 and LZTR1, which both suppress tumors, are associated with this type of neurofibromatosis."", 'Neurofibromatosis Diagnosis Neurofibromatosis is diagnosed using a number of tests, including: Physical examination Medical history Family history X-rays Computerized tomography (CT) scans Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) Biopsy of neurofibromas Eye tests Tests for particular symptoms, such as hearing or balance tests Genetic testing To receive a diagnosis of NF1, you must have two of the following features: Six or more café au lait spots that are 1.5 centimeters or larger in people who have had puberty, or 0.5 centimeters or larger in people who haven’t Two or more neurofibromas (tumors that develop from the cells and tissues that cover nerves) of any type, or one or more plexiform neurofibroma (a nerve that has become thick and misshapen due to the abnormal growth of cells and tissues that cover the nerve) Freckling in the armpit or groin Optic glioma (tumor of the optic pathway) Two or more Lisch nodules A distinctive bony lesion, dysplasia of the sphenoid bone, or dysplasia or thinning of long bone cortex A first-degree relative with NF1', 'To be diagnosed with NF2, you must have: Bilateral (on both sides) vestibular schwannomas, also known as acoustic neuromas. These are benign tumors that develop from the balance and hearing nerves supplying the inner ear . or Family history of NF2 (first-degree family relative) plus unilateral (on one side) or bilateral vestibular schwannomas, or any two of the following health conditions: Multiple meningiomas (tumors that occur in the meninges, the membranes that cover and protect the brain and spinal cord) Glioma ( cancer of the brain that begins in glial cells, which are those that surround and support nerve cells) Any neurofibromas Schwannoma Juvenile cataracts Gradual hearing loss Ringing in the ears Balance problems Headaches Schwannomatosis diagnosis is based on these criteria: If you’re 30 or older, you have no evidence of vestibular tumors on an MRI scan, no known NF2 gene mutation, and two or more schwannomas within or between skin layers, one being confirmed by a biopsy. You have one schwannoma confirmed by biopsy and a first-degree relative who also meets the criteria. If you have a type called segmental schwannomatosis, you have tumors limited to one area of the body, such as your arm, leg, or spine.', 'Neurofibromatosis Treatment There’s no cure for neurofibromatosis. Treatments focus on controlling symptoms. There’s no standard treatment for NF, and many symptoms, such as café au lait spots, do not need treatment. When treatment is necessary, options may include: Surgery to remove problem growths or tumors Treatment that includes chemotherapy or radiation if a tumor has turned malignant, or cancerous Surgery for bone problems, like scoliosis Therapy (including physical therapy , counseling , or support groups) Cataract removal surgery Aggressive treatment of pain linked to the condition Stereotactic radiosurgery Auditory brainstem and cochlear implants', 'Neurofibromatosis Complications Neurofibromatosis complications may vary from person to person. They typically stem from a growing tumor pressing against your nerve tissue or an internal organ. Possible NF1 complications include: Neurological problems like trouble learning or thinking Anxiety or distress with changes to your appearance, like large numbers of cafe au lait spots Skeletal problems, like bowing of the legs, scoliosis, fractures that don’t heal, or low bone density that increases your risk of osteoporosis Vision problems due to a tumor pressing against the optic nerve Problems during times of hormonal changes, such as puberty or pregnancy Cardiovascular problems like high blood pressure Breathing problems Higher risk of some cancers, such as breast cancer , leukemia , colorectal cancer, brain tumors , and some soft tissue cancers Benign adrenal gland tumor that could cause high blood pressure', 'Possible NF2 complications include: Partial hearing loss or deafness Nerve damage in the face Benign skin tumors or schwannomas Vision problems Weakness or numbness in your extremities Benign brain or spine tumors that need to be removed with surgery One possible schwannomatosis complication is severe pain that requires specialist medical treatment or even surgery.', 'Neurofibromatosis Outlook Your outlook depends on the type of NF you have. Often, the symptoms of NF1 are mild, and people who have it are able to lead full and productive lives. Sometimes, pain and deformity can lead to significant disability. The NF2 outlook depends on your age at the start of the disease and on the number and location of tumors. Some can be life-threatening.']"

You must also want to quit smoking for yourself, not to please your friends or family. It helps to plan ahead. This guide will help you get started."", 'What Should I Do First? Your first days of not smoking will be the hardest. You should pick a date to quit smoking and then stick to it. Write down your reasons for quitting before your quit day and read the list every day before and after you quit. You should also come up with a quit plan. It will help you stay focused and motivated. Here are some ideas to get you started: Write down when you smoke, why you smoke, and what you are doing when you smoke. These are your smoking triggers. You need to avoid these as often as possible going forward. Stop smoking in certain situations (such as during your work break or after dinner) before actually quitting. Make a list of activities you can do instead of smoking, like taking a brisk walk or chewing a piece of gum. You have to be ready to do something else when you want to smoke. Ask your doctor about using nicotine replacement therapy gum or patches. Some people find these helpful in curbing cravings. Join a smoking cessation support group or program. Call your local chapter of the American Lung Association to find groups near you. Tell your friends and family about your quit smoking plan, and let them know how they can support you.', 'Why Is Smoking So Addictive? Blame nicotine, the main drug in tobacco, for your smoking addiction . Your brain quickly adapts to it and craves more and more to feel the way you used to feel after smoking just one cigarette. Over time, your brain learns to predict when you\'re going to smoke a cigarette. You feel down and tired , so you think, ""I need a cigarette,"" and the cycle starts again. But it\'s not just about brain chemistry. Certain situations make you want to smoke. Everyone\'s triggers are different. Yours might include the smell of cigarette smoke, seeing a carton of cigarettes at the store, eating certain foods, or drinking your morning coffee .

Poisonous carbon monoxide in your blood drops, so your blood can carry more oxygen. No doubt about it: Quitting helps your entire body. It can even improve your looks: You'll be less likely to get wrinkles when you're still young. And you'll save money, too."", ""How Can I Avoid Smoking Again? Slipping is a common part of quitting. For most people trying to quit, even “just one puff” counts. And if you “have just one,” it makes it that much harder to go completely smoke free. But slipping does not mean you go back to smoking regularly. Use your slip up to focus on your triggers and learn how to better deal with cravings. And to avoid further slip ups and relapses, try the following: If you live with a smoker, ask them not to smoke around you. When you get the urge to smoke, take a deep breath. Hold it for 10 seconds and release it slowly. Repeat this several times until the urge is gone. Keep your hands busy. Doodle, play with a pencil or straw, or work on a computer. Change activities that were connected to smoking. Take a walk or read a book instead of taking a cigarette break. Hang out with nonsmokers or go to places that don't allow smoking, such as the movies, museums, shops, or libraries. Don't substitute food or sugar -based products for cigarettes. Exercise . Exercising will help you relax. Get support for quitting, especially from family and friends. Work with your doctor to develop a plan using over-the-counter or prescription nicotine replacement aids."", 'How Will I Feel? When you quit smoking, you will have both physical and mental withdrawals. You may crave cigarettes, feel irritable and hungry , cough often, get headaches , or have difficulty concentrating. You have these symptoms of withdrawal because your body is used to nicotine. When withdrawal symptoms occur within the first 2 weeks after quitting, stay in control. Think about your reasons for quitting. Remind yourself that these are signs that your body is healing and getting used to being without nicotine. The withdrawal symptoms are only temporary. They are strongest when you first quit but will go away within 10 to 14 days. Remember that withdrawal symptoms are easier to treat than the major diseases that smoking can cause. You may still have the desire to smoke, since there are many strong associations with smoking. The best way to overcome these associations is to enjoy them without smoking. If you relapse and smoke again, don’t lose hope. Seventy-five percent of those who quit smoke again. Most smokers quit 3 or more times before they are successful. Plan ahead and think about what you will do the next time you get the urge to smoke.']"

It isn’t a disease, but rather a symptom of another problem like untreated nearsightedness .', 'What Causes It? The problem comes from a disorder of the cells in your retina that allow you to see dim light. It has many causes: Nearsightedness Glaucoma Glaucoma medications that close the pupil Cataracts Diabetes Retinitis pigmentosa Vitamin A deficiency Keratoconus To pinpoint the cause, your eye doctor will carry out a full exam. They\xa0may order specialized tests.', 'How Is Night Blindness Treated? That depends on its cause. It may be as simple as a new prescription for glasses or a new medication . It could require surgery if cataracts are to blame.']"
23,Sleep-Related Eating Disorders,"[""Sleep-related eating disorders are characterized by abnormal eating patterns during the night. Although it is not as common as sleepwalking , nocturnal sleep -related eating disorder (NS-RED) can occur during sleepwalking. People with this disorder eat while they are asleep. They often walk into the kitchen and prepare food without a recollection for having done so. If NS-RED occurs often enough, a person can experience weight gain and increase their risk of developing type 2 diabetes . A closely related disorder, known as night eating syndrome (NES), is diagnosed when a person eats during the night with full awareness and may be unable to fall asleep again unless they eat. Symptoms of NES include the following and often persist for at least two months: Little or no appetite for breakfast Eating more food after dinner than during the meal Eating more than half of daily food intake after dinner hour Recurrent awakenings from sleep that require eating to fall back asleep NS-RED and NES differ, in that people with NES eat when they are conscious. However, the disorders are similar in that they both are hybrids of sleep and eating disorders . Both of these conditions can interfere with an individual's nutrition, cause shame, and result in depression and weight gain."", 'Who Gets Sleep-Related Eating Disorders? Both men and women are vulnerable to these disorders, but they are more common among women. One in 100 people\xa0are thought to have NES. Close to 5% suffer from NS-RED. The number of people affected by these disorders increases up to 17% in those with other eating disorders. Many of these individuals diet during the day, which may leave them hungry and vulnerable to binge eating at night, when their control is weakened by sleep. In some cases, people with sleep-related eating disorders have histories of alcoholism , drug abuse, and other sleep disorders.', 'How Are Sleep-Related Eating Disorders Treated? Treatment of sleep-related eating disorders begins with an interview and may include an overnight stay in a sleep lab, where brain activity is monitored during the night. Medication sometimes can be helpful for these disorders; however, sleeping pills should be avoided, because they can increase confusion and clumsiness that can lead to injury. Additional treatments may include methods to release stress and anxiety. Examples of these methods include stress management classes, assertiveness training, counseling, and limiting intake of alcohol and caffeine .']"
24,Do I Need Nitroglycerin for Sudden Chest Pain?,"['Do you know whether to take your nitroglycerin tablets before, during, or after chest pain ? And are there times when you shouldn’t take it at all? Doctors usually prescribe nitroglycerin for angina pectoris, which often is called just ""angina."" It’s sudden heart -related chest pain. It happens because something prevents the flow of blood to your heart muscle. Nitroglycerin helps widen the blood vessels so more blood gets to your heart muscle. That helps stop the pain.', 'When Should You Take Nitroglycerin? Your doctor may give you instructions to take your nitroglycerin before you have angina. That means taking it before activities that are more likely to cause it. For example, you might take it 5 to 10 minutes before you go for a bike ride. You might also take it before: Exercise Physical activity like carrying heavy items, using the vacuum, or raking leaves Sex (don’t take erectile dysfunction medicines at the same time) Situations that make you feel worried, anxious, or angry', 'You may take your nitroglycerin when you first feel the symptoms of angina. It’s important to know your own body and what angina is like for you. You may have: Aching, discomfort, or pain in your chest Aching, discomfort, or pain in your jaw, throat, shoulders, arms, or upper belly or abdomen Trouble breathing or shortness of breath Tiredness ( fatigue ) Nausea , a feeling of fullness or bloating , or gas If you have angina, take your nitroglycerin as instructed by your doctor. This might mean you take it as soon as you feel symptoms, or you wait a minute before you take it, or you take more than one pill over several minutes. If you take your nitroglycerin as instructed and you still have chest pain, get medical help right away.', 'When Should You Avoid Taking Nitroglycerin? As with any medicine, nitroglycerin might be harmful if you don’t take it correctly. You should not take nitroglycerin if: You have taken the maximum amount of short-acting nitroglycerin prescribed by your doctor You know your blood pressure is very low. Ask your doctor about this. You take medicine for erectile dysfunction', 'Nitroglycerin and Erectile Dysfunction Medicine Men with heart disease and other long-term health problems are more likely to have erectile dysfunction (ED) or trouble with erections. There are medicines that help men who have ED. You or your partner may take one of them. Prescription ED pills include: Avanafil Avanafil ( Stendra ) Sildenafil ( Viagra) Tadalafil ( Cialis ) Vardenafil ( Levitra , Staxyn ) Why shouldn’t you take your ED medicine with your nitroglycerin? The reason is that both lower your blood pressure. Taken together, your blood pressure may get to a very low, and dangerous, level. Because of this effect, the American Heart Association warns against it. You may still be able to take both medicines, at different times. Talk with your doctor about how long you should wait between taking the two medicines. For example, you may have to allow 24 to 48 hours or more between taking your ED medicine and nitroglycerin']"
25,What Is Nocardiosis?,"['Nocardiosis is a disease caused by bacteria found in soil or standing water. It starts in your lungs or skin , and can cause serious problems if it gets into your bloodstream and infects other parts of your body. Nocardiosis comes in two forms. You get the pulmonary (lung) version from breathing in the bacteria. The second type is primary cutaneous (skin). That’s when the bacteria gets into an open wound like a scratch. Between 500 and 1,000 people get it each year in the United States. Men are three times more likely to be infected by it than women -- middle-aged men working outdoors are at the highest risk. You also may have a greater chance of getting it if you have a weak immune system because of a condition like diabetes , HIV , or cancer , or if you’ve had a bone-marrow or organ transplant . If you’ve taken high doses of powerful steroids (drugs that help with inflammation ), it also increases your chances.', 'Symptoms The signs can be different, depending on which type you have. Pulmonary nocardiosis is the most common, and its symptoms are a lot like ones you might have with pneumonia or tuberculosis : Chest pain Coughing Sweating Chills Feeling weak Lack of appetite Unexplained weight loss Shortness of breath or a hard time breathing The most common signs of primary cutaneous nocardiosis are skin abscesses on your hands, chest, or rear end. These are bumps on or below the skin’s surface that are usually filled with a fluid (pus). You also might have a fever. If not treated, the infection can spread through your bloodstream to your brain or, more rarely, to your kidneys , intestines , or other organs. It can be very serious. Signs that the infection has spread to your brain include: Bad headaches Motor skills problem, like balance or hand- eye coordination Extreme sensitivity to loud sounds or bright lights If you have any of these symptoms, see your doctor right away.', 'Diagnosis It can be hard to tell the difference between pulmonary nocardiosis and pneumonia or tuberculosis. And primary cutaneous nocardiosis looks a lot like several other, more common skin infections. To find out for sure, your doctor probably will take a small sample of tissue or fluid from the area where you’re infected. This might include tissue or mucus from your lungs or tissue from your skin. If the infection is in your lungs, you might get a chest X-ray -- or a CT scan , which takes X-rays from several angles and puts them together to make a more detailed image.', 'Treatment Nocardiosis usually can be cured with antibiotics , but not all of them will work against the bacteria. Your doctor might need to run some lab tests to see which ones will work best for you. Then you might need to take them for 6 weeks up to a year, depending on how serious your infection is. In some cases, you might need surgery to remove or drain abscesses in infected areas.']"

While it's usually not a big deal, it can be frustrating for both you and your kid. Here's some more information about the types of bedwetting, why it happens, and when to see a doctor. Bedwetting happens when someone accidentally pees while sleeping. It's common in kids, even if they've been toilet trained. (Photo credit: iStock / Getty Images)"", ""What Is Bedwetting? Bedwetting, or nocturnal enuresis, happens when someone accidentally pees while sleeping. It's common in kids, even if they've been toilet trained. Your child will likely stop wetting the bed around 4 to 6 years old. While bedwetting can be a symptom of an underlying disease, most children who wet the bed have no underlying disease that explains their bedwetting . An underlying condition is found in only about 1% of children who routinely wet the bed. That does not mean that a child who wets the bed can control it or is doing it on purpose. They are not\xa0lazy, willful, or behaving badly. Bedwetting is most often a developmental issue.\xa0Most kids simply outgrow it and never need treatment. It's not a serious condition, but it can cause your child to feel embarrassed or upset. In some cases, they may even avoid activities, like sleepovers, out of fear that they'll wet the bed."", 'Types of Bedwetting There are 2 types of bedwetting: Primary bedwetting. Primary means bedwetting that has been going on since early childhood without a break. A child with primary bedwetting has never been dry at night for any significant length of time. Secondary bedwetting. Secondary bedwetting is bedwetting that starts after the child has been dry at night for a significant period of time, at least 6 months.', 'Causes of Bedwetting Primary bedwetting causes The cause is likely due to one or a combination of the following: The child cannot yet hold urine for the entire night. The child does not wake up when their bladder is full. The child makes a large amount of urine during the evening and night hours. The child has poor daytime toilet habits. Many children habitually ignore the urge to pee and put off peeing as long as they possibly can. Parents usually are familiar with the leg crossing, face straining, squirming, squatting, and groin holding that children use to hold back pee.', 'Secondary bedwetting causes Secondary bedwetting can be a sign of an underlying medical or emotional problem. A child with secondary bedwetting is much more likely to have other symptoms, such as daytime wetting. Common causes of secondary bedwetting include the following: Urinary tract infection . The resulting bladder irritation can cause pain or irritation with peeing, a stronger urge to pee (urgency), and frequent peeing (frequency). Urinary tract infections in children may indicate another problem, such as an anatomical abnormality. Diabetes . People with diabetes have a high level of sugar in their blood . The body makes more urine to try to get rid of the sugar. Having to pee often is a common symptom of diabetes. Structural or anatomical abnormality. An abnormality in the organs, muscles, or nerves involved in peeing can cause incontinence or other urinary problems that could show up as bedwetting. Sleep apnea. When your child’s breathing is disrupted, their brain works harder to take in oxygen than it does on other functions, like bladder control. Sleep apnea in children is often caused by enlarged tonsils and adenoids blocking their airway. In that case, removing their tonsils and adenoids can improve their breathing and end the bedwetting. Neurological problems. Abnormalities in the nervous system, or injury or disease of the nervous system, can upset the delicate neurological balance that controls peeing. Emotional problems. A stressful home life, as in a home where the parents are in conflict, sometimes causes children to wet the bed. Major changes, such as starting school, a new baby, or moving to a new home, are other stresses that can also cause bedwetting. Children who are being physically or sexually abused sometimes begin bedwetting.', ""ADHD and Bedwetting Bedwetting is quite common in children who have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Kids with ADHD are three times as likely to have trouble with bedwetting than those who don't. Experts aren't sure why ADHD is linked to bedwetting. But some people think it's because both things are related to a delay in the development of someone's central nervous system."", 'Children with ADHD also have a harder time paying attention to bodily cues. This means that they might not wake up at all or not wake up enough at night to notice they have to pee. A review found that a few things might put your child at risk of bedwetting if they have ADHD. These include: Being assigned male at birth A low birth weight Having parents with a lower educational level Having a family history of bedwetting Having sepsis as a newborn Being delivered via cesarean section or C-section', 'Autism and Bedwetting If your child has autism spectrum disorder (ASD), they might also be more likely to wet the bed. But experts still need to do more research to discover why ASD is linked to bedwetting.', 'One case study looked at how a 12-year-old girl with autism would react to bedwetting treatment. She wore a urine alarm at night and was rewarded for morning dryness. Experts found that this form of treatment lowered the number of bedwetting events within 2 weeks. By 3 weeks of treatment, bedwetting stopped.', 'Is Bedwetting Inherited? Bedwetting does tend to run in families. Many children who wet the bed have a parent who did too. Most of these children stop bedwetting on their own at about the same age their parent did.', ""How Common Is Bedwetting in Children? About 40% of 3-year-olds wet the bed. Experts don't fully understand why one child continues to wet the bed and another doesn't. It could be a matter of development. Sometimes a child's bladder is simply not developed enough to store pee for an entire night. Sometimes a child has not yet mastered the ability to know when the bladder is full, wake themselves up, and get to the bathroom."", 'What\'s ""Normal"" When It Comes to Bedwetting? The range is very wide regarding bedwetting . Typically, a child becomes toilet trained between ages 2 and 4. But some won\'t be able to stay dry through the night until they are older. By age 5 or 6, 85% of children can stay dry, but some children still wet the bed from time to time until age 10 or 12.', 'Sometimes a child who has been dry at night will begin to wet the bed again. This may be triggered by family stress or school problems. As a child\'s systems mature, they are less likely to wet at night. By the teen years or much earlier, almost all kids who wet their bed have outgrown the problem, with only 1% or less still having issues. Most children of school age who wet the bed at night have what doctors call ""primary enuresis."" They have never had nighttime control of their bladder. Family history plays a role, too, in incontinence in children. If you wet the bed as a child, don\'t be surprised if your child does, too.', ""How Does Bedwetting Affect a Person’s Mental Health? It's normal to feel embarrassed about bedwetting, but know that it's common. If you're an older child or an adult, your bedwetting may be a sign that your body isn't working as it should be. While it might be hard to bring bedwetting up to your doctor, they may be able to help you. Whether you're wetting the bed or your child is, a doctor can help you figure out the next steps."", ""When Should We Talk to the Pediatrician About Bedwetting? If your child has been dry and then starts to wet the bed, tell your pediatrician right away. Your child's doctor can check them to be sure the problem isn't stress related or due to an underlying medical condition. That likelihood is small. Only 1% of all bedwetting problems are thought to be caused by diabetes, infections, abnormalities of the bladder or kidney , or another medical condition. If your child has any symptoms that are not common, such as burning while peeing or passing bloody urine, talk to the doctor right away."", 'Bedwetting Treatments Managing bedwetting at home There are steps you can take at home to help your child stop wetting the bed. Some ways include to: Avoid blaming them. If you feel angry or frustrated because you have a wet bed to clean up yet again, don’t direct your feelings toward your child. They likely feel bad about it, and they didn’t do it on purpose. So don’t blame.', 'Make sure your child knows that bedwetting isn’t their fault and they aren’t alone. Let them know that millions of children, and teenagers too, regularly wet their beds. Tell your child if you did it too when you were growing up. You can help them see that it’s a problem that they will outgrow. Keep your other children from teasing them. If you have other children, let them know not to tease about bedwetting. You can make this a rule in your house. Help them try to use the bathroom before bedtime and during the night. Have your child use the bathroom when they start to get ready for bed, then once again the minute before they get into bed. This helps to empty their bladder .', 'If you’re still awake an hour or two after your child’s bedtime , think about waking them for a quick bathroom visit (or if your child is older, they might be able to set this habit for themselves). It won’t stop bedwetting, but it can reduce the amount of pee that might end up in the bed. If your child is afraid of the dark, put night lights in the hallway and the bathroom so they won’t hesitate to get up and go when the urge wakes them. Use an alarm. Some kids wet the bed because their bodies don’t yet tell them to wake up when their bladders are full. Bedwetting alarms wake children at the first sign that they’re letting go of\xa0pee and train the body to notice what it feels like when the bladder is full. The child wears special underwear with sensors that beep loudly when a small amount of urine leaks out. The beeping wakes them, and then they can go to the bathroom. In the first few weeks of use, however, it is usually a parent who is awakened by the alarm and then wakes the child to use the bathroom. If the alarm is used nightly and the wake-up routine is continued, your child will likely begin to wake up to the alarm within 4 to 6 weeks. Within 12 weeks, your child will likely be getting up on their own to go to the bathroom or hold their pee until morning.', 'These alarms are among the most effective and safest bed-wetting treatments. Studies show alarm therapy is often successful with children over age 7. Drink less water before bedtime. Some kids who worry that they’ll wet the bed don’t drink enough during the day. By evening, they’re so thirsty, they drink a lot. Help your child to drink more during the day, and let them have only one drink with dinner. Stay away from drinks with caffeine , including cola and iced tea . Caffeine makes the body speed up the pee-making process. Fizzy drinks can also cause problems, so be sure to have your child avoid soda. Use covers that protect their bed. Use a zip-up waterproof mattress cover so pee won’t reach the mattress. There are also waterproof pads to go between the sheets and blanket. After a wet night, you’ll only have to wash the pad, not the bed sheets. Medical treatment for bedwetting In some cases, you may need medication to help with bedwetting. There are different types that can help, including:', 'Drugs that change how much pee is made at night. A medication called desmopressin (DDAVP) will lower the amount of pee your body makes at night. It\'s a tablet taken by mouth that\'s only for children 6 and older. Avoid drinking too much liquid with these drugs though, because it can lead to issues like headaches and dizziness. Make sure you don\'t use this drug if your child has a fever, nausea, or diarrhea. Medicines that calm the bladder. Anticholinergic drugs, like oxybutynin (Ditropan XL), can help with having fewer bladder contractions and allow the bladder to hold more pee. This type of drug can be helpful for people who also have daytime wetting. But it\'s usually only used when different treatments haven\'t worked. There are more drugs that can help based on the reasons for bedwetting. In some cases, you\'ll have to use multiple medicines. Just know that once you stop the medication, bedwetting will start again. Medications may not help everyone because they don\'t cure the problem. Beware of devices or other treatments that promise a quick ""cure"" for bedwetting. There really is no such thing. Stopping bedwetting for most children takes patience, motivation, and time.', ""How Can I Help My Child During Bedwetting Treatment? Let your child know that bedwetting in children is common. It's nothing to be ashamed of and almost all children outgrow it with time. Make sure siblings understand this as well. Don't let them tease the bedwetter."", 'When to Call the Doctor Parents should consider treatment if their child is still wetting the bed between ages 6 and 7, according to the National Enuresis Society -- or sooner if the child seems troubled by bedwetting.

27,Understanding Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma -- the Basics,"['What Is Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma? Lymphoma refers to a malignancy of the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system is a network of nodes (knots of tissue) connected by vessels. Together, the lymph nodes drain fluid and waste products from the body. The lymph nodes act as tiny filters, removing foreign organisms and cells. Lymphocytes\xa0are a type of white blood cell that helps fight infections caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi. The lymph node function is to prevent infections from entering the bloodstream. When the lymphatic system is fighting an active infection, you may notice that some of the lymph nodes in the area of the infection become swollen and tender. This is the body’s normal reaction to an infection. Lymphoma occurs when the lymph-node cells or the lymphocytes begin to multiply uncontrollably, producing cancerous cells that have the abnormal capacity to invade other tissues throughout the body. The two main types of lymphoma are Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The differences in these two types of lymphoma are certain unique characteristics of the different lymphoma cells.', 'Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is further classified into a variety of subtypes based on the cell of origin (B-cell or T-cell), and the cell characteristics. The subtype of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma predicts the necessity of early treatment, the response to treatment, the type of treatment required, and the prognosis. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is much more common than Hodgkin lymphoma. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is the seventh most common cause of cancer -related deaths in the United States. The risk of developing non-Hodgkin lymphoma increases with age and it is more common in males than in females and in Caucasians. North America has one of the highest incidence of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.', ""What Causes Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma? The exact cause of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is unknown. However, there are multiple medical conditions that are associated with an increased risk of developing the disease: Inherited immune deficiencies Genetic syndromes: Down syndrome, Klinefelter's syndrome (a genetic condition in men caused by an extra X chromosome) Immune disorders , and their treatments: Sjögren's syndrome (an immune disorder characterized by unusual dryness of mucous membranes), rheumatoid arthritis , systemic lupus erythematosus Celiac disease, a disease involving the processing of certain components of gluten, a protein in grains Inflammatory bowel disease, particularly Crohn’s disease, and its treatment Psoriasis Family history of lymphoma Bacteria: Helicobacter pylori , associated with gastritis and gastric ulcers; Borrelia burgdorferi, associated with Lyme disease ; Campylobacter jejuni; Chlamydia psittaci Viruses: HIV , HTLV-1, SV-40, HHV-8, Epstein Barr virus, hepatitis virus Non-random chromosomal translocations and molecular rearrangements"", 'Other Factors Include: Regular exposure to certain chemicals, including insect and weed killers, and a number of chemicals used in industries such as farming, welding, and lumber Exposure to nuclear accidents, nuclear testing, or underground radiation leaks Treatment with immunosuppressant drugs, for prevention of organ transplantation rejection, or for treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune disorders Tumor necrosis factor agents used to treat psoriatic and rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease Prior exposure to chemotherapy and/or radiation used to treat a prior diagnosis of cancer Treatment with a medication called Dilantin (phenytoin), commonly used to treat seizure disorders Use of hair dyes, especially dark and permanent colors, used before 1980 (research is inconclusive) High levels of nitrates found in drinking water Diets high in fat and meat products Ultraviolet light exposure Alcohol intake']"

Uveitis gets its name from the uvea, the middle layer of your eye . It includes the iris (the colored part). The inflammation can also affect other parts of your eye , like the lens or retina. Adults between 20 and 60 years old are most likely to get it. How it affects you depends a lot on the cause and how quickly you get treated. You might only have minor problems with your sight. Or it could cause serious vision loss . You might have it for a short time or for many years. It could return again and again. Left alone, it can turn into serious eyesight troubles, like glaucoma or cataracts .', ""What Causes It? There are two types: Infectious uveitis can result from a bacteria or virus in your eye. Noninfectious uveitis can result from an eye injury or a disease somewhere else in your body. The uvea has a lot of blood vessels, so if your immune system is fighting off a problem in one area, the cells and chemicals it makes can travel through your bloodstream and enter your eye. That causes inflammation.

It's important to treat uveitis right away so it doesn’t permanently scar your eye or lead to other serious problems, like glaucoma or cataracts . Your doctor may give you steroid eye drops to ease the swelling, redness, and pain. Steroid shots or pills are other options.\xa0In addition the doctor may ask you to take eye drops like atropine which dilate your pupil and prevent painful spasm of your eye.\xa0This can make your vision blurry and sensitive to light. Doctors can treat some types of the condition with a small capsule that slowly releases steroids inside your eye. This is usually a treatment for long-lasting cases. Many of these cases are in just one eye. But with this treatment, you can be more likely to get cataracts or glaucoma. The surgery to put the capsule in your eye won’t require a hospital stay. If your doctor recommends this option, ask them what you can expect. If you take oral steroids for a long time, you may have side effects, like cataracts, stomach ulcers , bone thinning (your doctor will call this osteoporosis), diabetes , and weight gain . Ask them how the treatment may affect you. Other options include drugs that turn down your immune system . Your doctor will refer to them as immunosuppressants. Or you could get drugs to boost your body’s own response to inflammation. The doctor might call them biologics. They don’t get prescribed often, but your doctor may choose them if steroids haven't helped you. If you take them, you’ll get regular blood tests and doctor’s appointments to make sure they aren’t causing any side effects."", 'What Can I Do? Treatment will help ease any eye pain and swelling you may have, but keep your doctor informed about any discomfort or changes in your vision. If your uveitis was caused by another medical condition, you’ll need to make sure you get the right treatment for it as well.', 'What Should I Expect?

There are several topical forms available of both that you can apply to the affected area of your skin. Depending on which kind you use, your treatment could last from 2 days to 3 months, and cause mild to severe irritation to your skin. Liquid nitrogen. Your doctor may suggest freezing off the cancerous skin tumor. They might have to do it a couple of times, but it eventually kills the cancerous cells. Your skin will blister and crust up, but once it heals all you’ll be left with is a scar.', 'Surgery Basal cell and squamous cell skin cancers are the two most common nonmelanoma skin cancers. Surgery is often used to treat them. These procedures usually take a matter of minutes to an hour and only require local anesthe sia. Excision. Your doctor will use a blade to remove the cancer , as well as some cancer -free skin. This is a quick process that often requires stitches and will leave a scar. Electrodessication and Curettages. This procedure gets its name from the scoop-shaped tool called the curette. After your doctor removes the cancerous cells, they’ll use an electric needle to probe the skin around the area to kill any leftover cancer cells. You may repeat the process a couple of times during your visit, and you’ll probably end up with a scar. Mohs surgery . During this surgery, your doctor will remove thin layers of skin from the affected area and review them under a microscope to look for cancerous cells. It usually takes hours because your doctor repeats the procedure, removing a thin layer of skin and putting it under the microscope, until they no longer see\xa0any cancer cells. Mohs is common for cancers found on the face.', 'Radiation If you’re trying to avoid surgery or if your cancer is too large, radiation might be an option. It uses high-energy rays (such as X-rays) or particles (such as photons, electrons, or protons) to kill your cancer cells. You may have radiation after surgery to kill cancer cells that might have been left behind. It’s sometimes recommended as the only treatment for elderly people or those who have health conditions that make it dangerous for them to have surgery. Radiation also might be used instead of surgery if your tumor is very large or in a hard-to-treat area (like your eyelids or the tip of your nose) and the surgery might affect how you look. To treat skin cancer , external radiation is focused on the cancerous tumor to kill or stop its growth. To help limit some of the side effects, your doctor will likely use a type of radiation called electron beam radiation because it doesn’t go deeper than your skin. The goal is to destroy as much of the cancer as possible without hurting the rest of your body.', 'Your doctor might also use internal radiation -- putting radioactive materials inside the affected area -- to go with other treatments, especially if your cancer has metastasized, meaning spread to other parts of your body, such as your lymph nodes . Most often, the radiation is delivered by a machine. It’s a lot like getting an X-ray -- it doesn’t hurt and is fairly quick. But you may need to have several sessions. The side effects of radiation therapy include: Skin irritation Changes in skin color and texture Hair loss to the treatment site Damage to saliva -making glands and teeth (when treating near those areas) Nonmelanoma skin cancers treated only with radiation are more likely to come back than ones treated with surgery. And if you have certain other health issues, such as lupus or scleroderma , radiation therapy can sometimes make those conditions worse.', ""Photodynamic Therapy Photodynamic therapy (PDT), also called phototherapy, might be an option if you have: Actinic keratosis , a type of precancer Basal cell cancer near the surface of your skin Bowen's disease , also called squamous cell carcinoma in situ"", ""With PDT, your doctor uses a special light along with a drug to kill cancer cells. The drug goes on as a cream that your doctor rubs onto your skin over the cancer. Then, you need to wait at least 3-6 hours for your skin to absorb the medicine. In some cases, you may need to wait as long as 14-16 hours. When your doctor turns on the light, it kicks the drug into action to destroy the cancer. You can't get PDT for cancers that go deep into your skin because the light can't reach that far. It's mainly used for cancer that covers a large section of skin or that's clustered in one area. PDT tends to work just as well as other treatments like surgery and radiation, but there are usually no long-term side effects, and it doesn't leave a scar."", 'Other Options Your doctor might suggest other treatments based on the type of skin cancer you have, whether it continues to happen, and your overall health. These could include less common treatments, non-FDA-approved procedures, or even clinical trials . Talk to your doctor about your specific goals and concerns.', 'After Treatment Once your treatment is complete and the affected area is healed, you need to protect your skin. Many of these treatments can make your skin more sensitive to the sun. You will need to wear a daily broad-spectrum sunscreen to all exposed skin and reapply it every 2 hours when outside or near a window, cover up with hats and long sleeves, and avoid the sun, especially from 10 a.m. to\xa04 p.m. Your odds for getting skin cancer again go up if you’ve had it before. So it’s now more important than ever to perform regular skin checks, know what raises your odds of skin cancer, and take all necessary steps to prevent it from coming back. Your doctor may even recommend twice-a-year check-ups going forward.']"
30,What Is Epidermolysis Bullosa?,"['Epidermolysis bullosa is a rare genetic condition that makes skin so fragile that it can tear or blister at the slightest touch. Children born with it are often called “Butterfly Children” because their skin seems as fragile as a butterfly wing. Mild forms may get better with time. But severe cases can be painful, trigger other serious health issues, and can be life-threatening. If you have this condition, you need special treatment to keep your delicate skin as healthy as possible.', 'Types There are five major types of epidermolysis bullosa. The kind you have depends on where your blisters tend to form. Epidermolysis Bullosa Simplex: The most common type, it first shows up in newborns. It mainly affects the palms of the hands and soles of the feet . Junctional epidermolysis bullosa : While it also first appears in babies, this is a more severe form that causes blistering in deep layers of the skin. Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa: If you have this type, your skin doesn’t have collagen to hold it together, or the collagen you do have doesn’t work well. This means the layers of your skin don’t seal together like they should. Sometimes this type doesn’t show up until early childhood.', 'Kindler syndrome: This is a mixed condition since blisters appear across different skin layers. It can also cause patchy changes in your skin coloring when it’s exposed to the sun. Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita: This form causes blisters on your hands and feet as well as in mucous membranes like the mouth .', 'Causes Almost all types of epidermolysis bullosa run in families. If you inherited certain gene glitches from your parents, you will have it. There’s one exception. Epidermolysis bullosa aquisita is the only type that’s not inherited. It happens because of a problem in your immune system .', 'Symptoms Usually, signs of epidermolysis bullosa first appear in babies or toddlers . Painful skin blisters are the main symptom. They can form anywhere on the skin. Sometimes they also form on the eyes , or in parts of the throat, stomach , or bladder . If these blisters become infected or scar the skin, they cause more problems.', 'Diagnosis To confirm the condition, your doctor may take a small sample of skin and send it to a lab where experts will use a microscope to look at it.', 'Treatment There’s no cure for epidermolysis bullosa. But there are treatments for it. If you have a severe case, you’ll care for your skin much like someone who has a burn does. You’ll need to learn how to perform daily wound treatment and how to bandage and protect affected areas. Your doctor can also prescribe a medicine to help with pain relief. In some cases, you might need surgery. If you have blisters that have fused your fingers and toes together, your doctor can separate them. Or if your esophagus , the tube connecting your mouth to your stomach , becomes too scarred, you can get surgery to widen it to help you eat. Some people with epidermolysis bullosa still find eating too painful. In that case, your doctor may suggest a feeding tube so food goes right into your stomach.', 'Tips for At-Home Care To help prevent blisters, you have to take special care of your skin. Reduce friction. Use lotion to keep your skin moist and reduce friction. If you cover wounds, use only dressings that aren’t sticky, then loosely wrap again with rolled gauze. Wear loose-fitting clothes without tags, tight sleeves, or seams.', 'Drain blisters. If left untreated, these can fill with fluid and become infected. Your doctor can show you the best way to drain them. Keep cool. Keep your bath water no warmer than room temperature. Stay in air conditioning as much as you can and avoid heat and humidity. Know the signs of infection. Your skin may get red or feel hot to the touch if it is becoming infected. You could also notice pus or a yellow discharge crusting at the site, a red streak under the skin, or have fever or chills. If you see any of these signs, call your doctor right away. You may need antibiotics . Check your diet . Many people with epidermolysis bullosa have low levels of iron, selenium , or vitamin D . Your doctor may suggest that you see a nutritionist about eating more foods that are rich in these vitamins and minerals.', 'Get support. Talk to your doctor or someone you trust. You might also find it helpful to talk about your feelings to a therapist or at a support group in your area.']"
31,Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer,"[""What Is Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)? Most people who have lung cancer have NSCLC. Although it's serious, treatment can sometimes stop it from getting worse. There are things you can do to help you feel better, too. People who smoke or who breathe a lot of smoke are most likely to get NSCLC. Many of them are over 65. There are four kinds of NSCLC tumors: Adenocarcinoma starts in cells in your air sacs that make mucus and other substances, often in the outer parts of your lungs . It's the most common kind of lung cancer among both smokers and nonsmokers and people under 45. It often grows more slowly than other lung cancers. Squamous cell (epidermoid) carcinoma starts in cells that line the inner airways of the lungs . About a quarter of lung cancers are this kind. Large cell (undifferentiated) carcinoma grows and spreads more quickly. That can make it tougher to treat. It's about 10% of lung cancers. Adenosquamous carcinoma is relatively rare and generally develops in\xa0the outer part of the lungs. Smoking can increase the risk of its development. The treatments your doctor suggests will depend on how far your lung cancer has spread."", ""Causes Doctors aren't sure exactly what causes this disease. Many people who get it have smoked or been around smoke. Other things that make lung cancer more likely are: Radon, a radioactive gas found naturally in soil and rocks Asbestos Mineral and metal dust Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) Pulmonary fibrosis Air pollution Radiation treatment to your chest or breast HIV /AIDS It can also run in families."", 'Symptoms You may not notice symptoms in the early stages. Or you might mistake them for another illness, such as pneumonia or a collapsed lung . Like other types of lung cancer , symptoms can include: Coughing that lasts or gets worse Chest pain that often hurts more when you cough , laugh, or take deep breaths Hoarseness or voice changes Harsh, raspy sounds when you breathe Wheezing Weight loss , little appetite Coughing up blood or mucus Shortness of breath Feeling weak or tired Lasting lung problems, like bronchitis or pneumonia If the cancer spreads to other parts of the body, you may have: Bone pain Headache Dizziness or balance problems Numbness or weakness in an arm or leg Yellow skin or eyes', ""Getting a Diagnosis First, your doctor will talk with you and ask questions like: When did you first notice problems? How have you been feeling? Are you coughing or wheezing ? Does anything make your symptoms better or worse? What do you do for a living? Do you, or did you, smoke? Has anyone in your family had lung cancer ? They'll also give you a physical exam . You will need tests, too. Imaging tests help your doctor find tumors inside your lungs. They can also show whether the cancer has spread. X-rays use low doses of radiation to make images of structures inside your body. MRI, or magnetic resonance imaging , shows blood flow, organs, and structures. Ultrasound creates a picture by bouncing sound waves off tissues inside you. PET scans use a radioactive compound or tracer that collects where your cells are very active. CT scans are powerful X-rays that make detailed pictures of the tissue and the blood vessels in the lung. Sputum cytology is a lab test that checks the mucus you cough up for cancer cells."", 'Fine-needle aspiration biopsy takes cells from an abnormal growth or the fluid in your lungs. Your doctor may want to look inside your lungs and chest using a thin, flexible tube with a light and tiny camera. They may also take samples of tissue, including from nearby lymph nodes, to check for cancer cells. They can do this a few different ways: Bronchoscopy goes through your nose or mouth and into your lungs. Endobronchial ultrasound uses bronchoscopy with an ultrasound placed at the tip of the tube to look at lymph nodes and other structures. Endoscopic ultrasound is like the endobronchial ultrasound, but your doctor puts the endoscope down your throat into the esophagus . Thoracoscopy uses a few small cuts along your side to look at the outside of your lung and the tissue around it. Mediastinoscopy makes a small cut just above your breastbone, in the space between your lungs. Based on what your doctor finds, they\'ll assign a stage, describing where the cancer is. That will help your medical team figure out the best treatment for you. You’ll want to know what each stage means: Occult stage: ""Occult"" means ""hidden."" Cancer cells are in lung fluid or sputum, but the doctor can\'t find where the cancer is in your lungs. Stage 0: Cancer cells are in the lining of your airways. Stage I: A small tumor is in only one lung. The cancer hasn\'t spread to lymph nodes. Stage II: A larger tumor is in one lung, or the cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes. Stage III: Cancer in one lung has spread to farther lymph nodes or into nearby structures. Stage IV: Cancer has spread to both lungs, to fluid around the lungs, or to other parts of the body, such as the brain and liver .', 'Questions for Your Doctor Finding out that you have cancer is overwhelming. You may want to start by asking your doctor: How serious is my lung cancer? Has it spread, where to, and what does that mean? What are my cancer treatment options? How well do they work? What are the side effects? What other treatments might I need to feel OK? Will I have to stop working while having treatment? What happens if the cancer continues to spread? Have you treated anyone else with this type of lung cancer ? Can I take part in clinical trials ? How can I find out about that? Is there a medical center that takes care of my kind of cancer regularly that I could go to? Ask a friend or family member to go with you to your appointments for emotional support and to help you understand what the doctor tells you. You may feel more comfortable getting a second opinion before deciding on your treatment plan.', ""Treatment Doctors treat this kind of lung cancer in two ways: They target the cancer itself, and they try to make you feel better. Their goal is to stay ahead of the symptoms and make you as comfortable as possible. Your doctor may suggest a combination of treatments, depending on what kind of cancer you have and where it is. Surgery . If you’re in an early stage, your doctor will probably recommend surgery to take out the cancer. You could have a part or all of your lung removed. Other types of surgery destroy cancer cells by freezing them or using a heated probe or needle. Radiation . It can kill cancer cells that remain after surgery. It also treats certain cancers that your doctor can't get rid of with surgery. The radiation comes either from a high-energy beam aimed at the cancer from outside of your body using a special machine, or from a radioactive substance put inside your body in or near the cancer. Chemotherapy . Whether you get it as pills or with a needle in a vein or muscle, the drugs travel throughout your body to kill the cancer. Your doctor might put it in your spinal fluid, a specific organ, or a space inside your body to target cancer cells in that area. You could get chemo before surgery to make a tumor smaller, after surgery, or both, or even if you don't have surgery."", 'Targeted therapy . These drugs and antibodies stop cancer cells from growing and spreading in very specific ways. Because of how they work, they usually harm normal cells less than radiation and chemo . Laser and photodynamic therapy (PDT) . This technique uses a special laser light to ""turn on"" special drugs that cancer cells have absorbed. This kills them and helps avoid damage to healthy tissue. Clinical trials . Scientists are studying new ways to treat cancer. Check the National Cancer Institute\'s web site and ask your doctor if a clinical trial would be a good fit for you, what you should consider, and how to sign up. Let your doctor know if you have any pain or shortness of breath. There are treatments for that so you can feel better.', ""Taking Care of Yourself As you follow your treatment plan, pay attention to any changes you feel. Tell your doctor how you’re doing, both physically and emotionally. Some days, your appetite may not be great. But you'll need to eat well to keep your strength and energy up. Try to eat several small meals throughout the day instead of a few large ones."", ""If you have trouble breathing , oxygen from a tank may help. So can practicing relaxation techniques, like meditation , listening to music, or picturing yourself in a peaceful place. Complementary treatments, including gentle massage and aromatherapy , may put you more at ease. Talk to your doctor about what you can do when you're tired, in pain, or breathless. Finding out that you have cancer is very hard to deal with. You may be afraid, angry, or sad. Strong emotions are normal. A support group or a counselor who works with people who have cancer could help you work through your feelings. Look online or in your community, or ask your doctor for suggestions and about other professionals who can help support you -- perhaps social workers, nurses, clergy, or other doctors."", ""What to Expect If it's caught early enough, your cancer may be curable. Even if it's not, your treatment should help you live longer and feel better. Throughout your treatment, you can make choices about what's best for you."", 'Getting Support The Lung Cancer Alliance can help you find other people and families near you who have also faced this disease. Their support can make it easier to live with NSCLC.']"
32,Henoch-Schonlein Purpura (HSP),"['Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP) is a disease involving inflammation of small blood vessels. It most commonly occurs in children. The inflammation causes blood vessels in the skin , intestines , kidneys , and joints to start leaking. The main symptom is a rash with numerous small bruises , which have a raised appearance, over the legs or buttocks. Henoch-Schonlein purpura. Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP) is a disease that involves inflammation which causes blood vessels in the skin, intestines, kidneys, and joints to start leaking. The main symptom is a rash with numerous small bruises, which have a raised appearance, over the legs or buttocks. Other symptoms can include joint and abdominal pain as well as kidney impairment. HSP most commonly occurs in children and in boys more than girls. Adults who develop it generally experience more severe cases. Although HSP can affect people at any age, most cases occur in children between the ages of 2 and 11. It is more common in boys than girls. Adults with HSP are more likely to have more severe disease compared to children. HSP usually ends after four to six weeks -- sometimes with recurrence of symptoms over this period, but with no long-term consequences (recurrences are fairly common). If organs such as the kidneys and intestines are affected, treatment is often needed and it is important to have regular follow-up to prevent serious complications.', ""Causes and Risk Factors for Henoch-Schonlein Purpura The exact cause of HSP is not known. The body's immune system is believed to play a role in targeting the blood vessels involved. An abnormal immune response to an infection may be a factor in many cases. Approximately two-thirds of the cases of HSP occur days after symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection develop. Some cases of HSP have been linked to vaccinations for typhoid, cholera , yellow fever , measles , or hepatitis B; foods, drugs, chemicals, and insect bites. Some experts also say that HSP is associated with the colder weather of fall and winter."", 'Symptoms of Henoch-Schonlein Purpura The classic symptoms of HSP are rash , joint pain and swelling, abdominal pain , and/or related kidney disease , including blood in urine. Before these symptoms begin, patients may have two to three weeks of fever, headache, and muscular aches and pains. Rarely, other organs, such as the brain , lungs , or spinal cord may be affected. Here are some key details about the symptoms of HSP: Rash. The rash usually appears in all patients with HSP. The initial appearance may resemble hives , with small red spots or bumps on the lower legs, buttocks, knees , and elbows. But these change to appear more like bruises . The rash usually affects both sides of the body equally and does not turn pale on pressing.', 'Arthritis . Joint inflammation, involving pain and swelling, occurs in approximately three-quarters of cases, particularly affecting the knees and ankles . It usually lasts only a few days and does not cause any long-term, chronic joint problems. Abdominal pain. In more than half of people with HSP, inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract may cause pain or cramping; it may also lead to loss of appetite, vomiting , diarrhea , and occasionally blood in the stool.', ""In some cases, patients may have abdominal pain before the rash appears. In rare cases, an abnormal folding of the bowel (intussusception) may cause a bowel blockage, which may require surgery to fix. Kidney impairment. HSP can cause kidney problems, indicated by such signs as protein or blood in the urine . This is usually only discovered on urine testing, since it does not generally cause any discomfort. In most patients, the kidney impairment is mild and goes away without any long-term damage. It's important to monitor the kidney problems closely and make sure they clear up, since about 5% of patients may develop progressive kidney disease. About 1% may go on to develop total kidney failure."", 'Henoch-Schonlein Purpura Diagnosis and Treatment The diagnosis of HSP may be clear when the typical rash, arthritis , and abdominal pain are present. A doctor may order some tests to rule out other diagnoses, confirm the diagnosis, and assess its severity. Occasionally, when the diagnosis is uncertain, particularly if the only symptom is the classic rash, your doctor may perform biopsies of the skin or kidney. Urine and blood tests will likely be done to detect signs of kidney involvement and may need to be repeated during follow-up to monitor any changes in kidney function.', 'Although there is no specific treatment for HSP, you can use over-the-counter pain medicines, such as acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ), such as ibuprofen and naproxen for joint pain. In some cases, corticosteroid medication may be used. The rash and joint pain will usually go away after four to six weeks without causing any permanent damage. Bouts of the rash may recur in approximately one-third of cases, but usually they are\xa0 milder, do not involve joint and abdominal symptoms, and they clear up on their own.']"
33,Whole Medical Systems: An Overview,"[""Introduction Whole medical systems involve complete systems of theory and practice that have evolved independently from or parallel to allopathic (conventional) medicine. Many are traditional systems of medicine that are practiced by individual cultures throughout the world. Major Eastern whole medical systems include traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), Kampo medicine (Japanese), and Ayurvedic medicine, one of India's traditional systems of medicine. Major Western whole medical systems include homeopathy and naturopathy. Other systems have been developed by Native American, African, Middle Eastern, Tibetan, and Central and South American cultures."", 'Traditional Chinese Medicine Traditional Chinese medicine is a complete system of healing that dates back to 200 B.C. in written form. Korea, Japan, and Vietnam have all developed their own unique versions of traditional medicine based on practices originating in China. In the TCM view, the body is a delicate balance of two opposing and inseparable forces: yin and yang. Yin represents the cold, slow, or passive principle, while yang represents the hot, excited, or active principle. Among the major assumptions in TCM are that health is achieved by maintaining the body in a ""balanced state"" and that disease is due to an internal imbalance of yin and yang. This imbalance leads to blockage in the flow of qi (or vital energy) along pathways known as meridians. TCM practitioners typically use herbs, acupuncture , and massage to help unblock qi in patients in an attempt to bring the body back into harmony and wellness.', 'Treatments in TCM are typically tailored to the subtle patterns of disharmony in each patient and are based on an individualized diagnosis. The diagnostic tools differ from those of conventional medicine. There are three main therapeutic modalities: Acupuncture and moxibustion (the burning of an herb above the skin to apply heat to the acupuncture point) Chinese Materia Medica (the catalog\xa0of natural products used in TCM) Massage and manipulation Although TCM proposes that natural products cataloged in Chinese Materia Medica or acupuncture can be used alone to treat virtually any illness, quite often they are used together and sometimes in combination with other treatment modalities (such as massage, moxibustion, diet changes, or exercise).', 'The scientific evidence on selected TCM treatments is discussed below. Acupuncture Acupuncture is widely practiced for relief or prevention of pain and for various other health conditions, according to the National Institutes of Health. Acupuncture is now considered to have potential clinical value for nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy or an after-effect of surgery, low- back pain , neck pain , osteoarthritis and knee pain, tension headaches , migraines , and dental pain. Limited evidence also suggests its potential in the treatment of other chronic pain disorders.', ""Studies have documented acupuncture's effects, but they have not been able to fully explain how acupuncture works within the framework of the Western system of medicine. It is proposed that acupuncture produces its effects by the conduction of electromagnetic signals at a greater-than-normal rate, thus aiding the activity of pain-killing biochemicals, such as endorphins and immune system cells at specific sites in the body. In addition, studies have shown that acupuncture may alter brain chemistry by changing the release of neurotransmitters and neurohormones and affecting the parts of the central nervous system related to sensation and involuntary body functions, such as immune reactions and processes whereby a person's blood pressure , blood flow, and body temperature are regulated. Chinese Materia Medica Chinese Materia Medica is a standard reference book of information on medicinal substances that are used in Chinese herbal medicine.Herbs or botanicals usually contain dozens of bioactive compounds. Many factors--such as geographic location, harvest season, post-harvest processing, and storage--could have a significant impact on the concentration of bioactive compounds. In many cases, it is not clear which of these compounds underlie an herb's medical use. Moreover, multiple herbs are usually used in combinations called formulas in TCM, which makes the standardization of herbal preparations very difficult. Further complicating research on TCM herbs, herbal compositions and the quantity of individual herbs in a classic formula are usually adjusted in TCM practice according to individualized diagnoses. In the past decades, major efforts have been made to study the effects and effectiveness of single herbs and of combinations of herbs used in classic TCM formulas. The following are examples of such work: Artemisia annua . Ancient Chinese physicians identified that this herb controls fevers . In the 1970s, scientists extracted the chemical artemisinin from Artemisia annua . Artemisinin is the starting material for the semi-synthetic artemisinins that are proven to treat malaria and are widely used. There is a lower concentration of artemisinin in herbal preparations than in the drug products, and there is concern that using it alone as a therapy may cause resistance. Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F (Chinese Thunder God vine) . Thunder God vine has been used in TCM for the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. The first small randomized, placebo -controlled trial of a Thunder God vine extract in the United States showed a significant dose-dependent response in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.In larger, uncontrolled studies, however, renal, cardiac, hematopoietic, and reproductive toxicities of Thunder God vine extracts have been observed."", 'Ayurvedic Medicine Ayurveda, which literally means ""the science of life,"" is a natural healing system developed in India. Ayurvedic texts claim that the sages who developed India\'s original systems of meditation and yoga developed the foundations of this medical system. It is a comprehensive system of medicine that places equal emphasis on the body, mind, and spirit, and strives to restore the innate harmony of the individual. Some of the primary Ayurvedic treatments include diet, exercise , meditation, herbs, massage, exposure to sunlight, and controlled breathing. In India, Ayurvedic treatments have been developed for various diseases (e.g., diabetes, cardiovascular conditions, and neurological disorders). However, a survey of the Indian medical literature indicates that the quality of the published clinical trials generally falls short of contemporary methodological standards with regard to criteria for randomization, sample size, and adequate controls.', 'Naturopathy Naturopathy is a system of healing, originating from Europe, that views disease as a manifestation of alterations in the processes by which the body naturally heals itself. It emphasizes health restoration as well as disease treatment. The term ""naturopathy"" literally translates as ""nature disease."" Today naturopathy, or naturopathic medicine, is practiced throughout Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and the United States. There are six principles that form the basis of naturopathic practice in North America (not all are unique to naturopathy): The healing power of nature Identification and treatment of the cause of disease The concept of ""first do no harm"" The doctor as teacher Treatment of the whole person Prevention', 'The core modalities supporting these principles include diet modification and nutritional supplements , herbal medicine, acupuncture and Chinese medicine, hydrotherapy, massage and joint manipulation, and lifestyle counseling. Also, in some states, naturopathic licensure allows for the use of some, if not all, pharmaceuticals that medical doctors can use. Treatment protocols combine what the practitioner deems to be the most suitable therapies for the individual patient. 8 As of this writing, there is no single research study on naturopathy as a complete system of medicine, as such studies would be difficult to design. However, many botanicals have been studied extensively and some of these are used by naturopathic doctors. For example, in a study of 524 children, echinacea did not prove effective in treating colds.', 'In contrast, a smaller, double-blind trial of an herbal extract solution containing echinacea, propolis (a resinous product collected from beehives), and vitamin C for ear pain in 171 children concluded that the extract may be beneficial for ear pain associated with acute otitis media.10 A naturopathic extract known as Otikon Otic Solution (containing Allium sativum, Verbascum thapsus, Calendula flores, and Hypericum perforatum in olive oil) was found as effective as anesthetic ear drops and was proven appropriate for the management of acute otitis media-associated ear pain.', 'Another study looked at the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of cranberry tablets (which are used by naturopaths, allopaths, and herbalists) versus cranberry juice and versus a placebo -- as prophylaxis against urinary tract infections (UTIs). Compared with the placebo, both cranberry juice and cranberry tablets decreased the number of UTIs. Cranberry tablets proved to be the most cost-effective prevention for UTIs.', 'Homeopathy Homeopathy is a complete system of medical theory and practice. Its founder, German physician Samuel Christian Hahnemann (1755-1843), hypothesized that one can select therapies on the basis of how closely symptoms produced by a remedy match the symptoms of the patient\'s disease. He called this the ""principle of similars."" Hahnemann proceeded to give repeated doses of many common remedies to healthy volunteers and carefully record the symptoms they produced. This procedure is called a ""proving"" or, in modern homeopathy, a ""human pathogenic trial."" As a result of this experience, Hahnemann developed his treatments for sick patients by matching the symptoms produced by a drug to symptoms in sick patients.Hahnemann emphasized from the beginning carefully examining all aspects of a person\'s health status, including emotional and mental states, and tiny idiosyncratic characteristics.', ""Since homeopathy is administered in minute or potentially nonexistent material dosages, there is an a priori skepticism in the scientific community about its efficacy. Nonetheless, the medical literature provides evidence of ongoing research in the field. Studies of homeopathy's effectiveness involve three areas of research: Comparisons of homeopathic remedies and placebos Studies of homeopathy's effectiveness for particular clinical conditions Studies of the biological effects of potencies, especially ultra-high dilutions Five systematic reviews and meta-analyses evaluated clinical trials of the effectiveness of homeopathic remedies as compared with placebo. The reviews found that, overall, the quality of clinical research in homeopathy is low. But when high-quality studies were selected for analysis, a surprising number showed positive results. Overall, clinical trial results are contradictory, and systematic reviews and meta-analyses have not found homeopathy to be a definitively proven treatment for any medical condition."", ""Summary While whole medical systems differ in their philosophical approaches to the prevention and treatment of disease, they share a number of common elements. These systems are based on the belief that one's body has the power to heal itself. Healing often involves marshaling multiple techniques that involve the mind, body, and spirit. Treatment is often individualized and dependent on the presenting symptoms. To date, NCCAM's research efforts have focused on individual therapies with adequate experimental rationale and not on evaluating whole systems of medicine as they are commonly practiced."", 'References Takeshige C.

34,What Is Noonan Syndrome?,"['Noonan syndrome is a rare genetic disorder. If you have it, you might have certain identifiable facial features, short height, and unusual chest shape. You may also have heart defects. It can cause a wide range of other physical and developmental symptoms that usually start at birth. There’s no cure for it, but doctors can treat some of the symptoms as they happen.', 'What Causes It? Noonan syndrome is caused by a genetic defect. Scientists have identified four\xa0genes involved in the syndrome: PTPN11, SOS1, RAF1, and KRAS. There are two ways you can get this syndrome: The gene mutation is passed down to you by one parent The altered gene happens for the first time while you are still in the womb', 'What Are the Symptoms? There are many symptoms, and they may be mild, moderate, or severe. Head, Face, and Mouth Widely spaced eyes Deep groove between the nose and mouth Low-set ears that arch backward Short neck Extra skin on the neck (“webbing”) Small lower jaw High arch in the roof of the mouth Crooked teeth', 'Bones and Chest Short height (about 70% of patients) Either sunken or protruding chest Low-set nipples Scoliosis Heart Most babies with Noonan syndrome are also born with heart disease . They may have: Narrowing of the valve that moves blood from the heart to the lungs Swelling and weakening of the heart muscle Atrial septal defects Blood Excessive bruising Nosebleeds Prolonged bleeding after an injury or surgery Blood cancer ( leukemia ) Puberty Delayed puberty Testes that don’t descend -- this can cause infertility Other Symptoms Vision or hearing problems Feeding problems (these usually improve by age 1 or 2) Mild intellectual or development disability (although most have normal intelligence) Puffy feet and hands (in infants)', 'How’s It Diagnosed? Before your baby is born, your doctor might consider that he has Noonan syndrome if a pregnancy ultrasound shows: Extra amniotic fluid around your baby in the amniotic sac A cluster of cysts in your baby ’s neck Problems with their heart structure or other structural problems', 'Your doctor might also suspect Noonan syndrome if you have abnormal results on a specialized prenatal test, called a maternal serum triple screen. Most of the time, they’ll know your baby has this condition at birth or shortly after by examining them. But sometimes, it’s hard to recognize and diagnose.', 'What’s the Treatment? There isn’t one. But your doctor will prescribe treatments for your baby’s symptoms or complications. For example, growth hormones may help with growth problems.', 'What Else Should I Know? If you have Noonan syndrome, you may wonder if your future children will have it. That depends on your family’s history If one of your parents has the condition, they have a 50% chance of passing it on to you. But if you have Noonan syndrome and no one else in your family had it, the defective gene may have started with you. Doctors call this a “de novo mutation.” In this case, your chances of passing it along to a future child are very small -- less than 1%. If you’re concerned, see a genetic specialist. They can run tests to spot mutations that happen with this syndrome, and help confirm whether your child has it or not.']"
35,Normal Period,"['What Is a Normal Period? A normal period (or normal menstruation ) is different for every woman. Each month, one of your ovaries releases an egg. Meanwhile, your uterus gets ready to help your baby grow if that egg gets fertilized. If it does, you’re pregnant . If it doesn’t, your body sheds the lining of your uterus through your vagina . That’s your period. It happens, on average, every 28 days. Think about how old you were when you got your first period . Now think about how old you may be when you enter menopause. Your body and life will change a lot from one to the other, right? So does your menstrual cycle. When it comes to periods, ""normal"" covers a lot of ground. Use the broad range of factors below as a guide. And remember: The only true normal is what\'s normal for you.', 'Normal Period Timing Every month, your entire body prepares to get pregnant . Your ovaries release an egg. Hormones rise and fall.', ""This is your menstrual cycle. It starts on the first day of your last period and ends on the first day of your next period. Though the average cycle is 28 days long, anything between 21 and 45 days is considered normal. That's a 24-day difference. For the first year or two after menstruation begins, women tend to have longer cycles that don't start at the same time every month. Older women often have shorter, more consistent cycles. If you're on birth control pills or have an IUD , it can change the timing of your period. Ask your doctor what's normal for your form of contraception . How long your period lasts also varies. The time from the first sign of blood to the last is usually in the 3-to-5-day range. Any length from 2 days to a week is normal for a period."", ""Normal Period Flow If the egg your ovary releases every month isn't fertilized, the lining of your uterus sheds through your vagina . This is your period. The amount of blood that comes out of your body is called your menstrual flow. Whether your flow is light, moderate, or heavy, it can all be considered normal."", 'Normal Period Symptoms Some months, your breasts may feel tender when you have your period. Other months, you may notice bloating around your abdomen or mood swings. Other normal menstruation symptoms include: Acne Cramping in the lower abdomen and back More hunger Sleep issues Mood swings Breast tenderness Bloating Not every period is the same, though. Most of the time, an irregular or abnormal period isn’t serious. But you should call the doctor if: You have a heavier than usual flow You need to change your pad or tampon hourly Your period lasts more than 7 days Your period suddenly stops for more than 90 days You have severe pain You think you might be pregnant', 'How to Track Your Period In just 3 months, you can get a picture of what’s normal for you by tracking your periods. Keep a record of: When your period starts and when it stops How light or heavy your flow is Whether or not you passed any blood clots How frequently you change pads or tampons How severe your cramps are Changes in mood Spotting between periods']"
36,Gaucher Disease,"[""What Is Gaucher Disease? Gaucher disease is a rare condition passed down through your family. (Credit: iStock/Getty Images) Gaucher\xa0disease is a rare condition that can cause a variety of symptoms, from weakening of your bones to easy bruising. There's no cure. But depending on which type you have, treatment can help you manage some of the symptoms. Gaucher\xa0causes problems with the way your body gets rid of a certain kind of fat. With all types of this disease, an enzyme you need to break fat down doesn't work right. Fat builds up, especially in your liver, spleen, and bone marrow, and causes problems. There are three main types of Gaucher\xa0disease. Type 1, also known as non-neuronopathic Gaucher, is the most common. If you have it, your symptoms may be mild, moderate, or serious. Some people don't have any at all. There are many treatments for type 1. Type 2 and type 3 are more serious. Both affect the central nervous system. Babies with type 2 usually don't live past age 2. Type 3 also causes damage to the brain and spinal cord, but symptoms show up later in childhood. Your blood might not clot well, or you might get anemia . It can also cause bone mineral loss that leads to pain and easily broken bones."", ""It's passed along in families -- about 1 in 450 people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent (from Eastern and Central Europe) have the condition. It's the most common genetic disease that affects Jewish people. Whether you have the disease or are the parent of a child who has it, it's important to get support from family, friends, and perhaps a support group."", 'Causes of Gaucher Disease Gaucher\xa0disease isn\'t something you ""catch,"" like a cold or the flu. It\'s an inherited condition that\'s caused by a problem with the GBA gene and passed down through your family. You get the disease when both of your parents pass along a damaged GBA gene to you. You can pass a faulty gene on to your children even if you don\'t have Gaucher disease.', ""Symptoms of Gaucher Disease Symptoms vary a lot from person to person and depend in part on what type of Gaucher\xa0disease you've got."", ""Type 1. Symptoms of type 1 can appear at any time in your life, but they usually show up by the teen years. Sometimes the disease is so mild you won't notice any problems."", 'Some symptoms you might have are: Easy bruising, caused by low levels of blood platelets Nosebleeds Tiredness , caused by anemia (low levels of red blood cells) Enlarged spleen or liver, which makes your belly look swollen Bone problems like pain, breaks, or arthritis Lung disease Type 2. This very serious type affects infants, usually when they\'re 3 to 6 months old. Symptoms include: Slow back-and-forth eye movement Not gaining weight or growing as expected, called ""failure to thrive"" A high-pitched sound when breathing Seizures Brain damage , especially to the brain stem Enlarged liver or spleen Inability to swallow Pneumonia Throat muscle spasms Collodion skin, which looks like a thin, shiny coating Slow heart rate Infections Lung problems Bluish skin Perinatal lethal Gaucher\xa0disease . An infant with this form of type 2 usually lives only a few days. The symptoms include: Too much fluid in the baby\'s body before or soon after they\'re born Dry, scaly skin (called ichthyosis) and other skin problems Enlarged liver and spleen Serious brain and spinal cord problems Swollen stomach Unusual facial features', 'Type 3. Like type 2, it starts in childhood, but usually at a later age. The timing varies, but it usually shows up by the teen years. Type 3 brings the same blood and bone problems that type 1 does and also causes symptoms like: Trouble moving eyes side to side or up and down Lung disease that gets worse A slow breakdown in mental ability Problems controlling arms and legs Muscle spasms or shocks Your child may feel very ill and might need help to eat or get extra nutrition. As type 3 symptoms get worse, they may need help to dress, bathe, or get around the house. With the right treatments, people with type 3 can live into their 20s or 30s. There are technically three varieties of type 3 Gaucher: 3a, 3b, and 3c. But their symptoms often overlap. Type 3b may cause liver or spleen problems earlier. Type 3c, also called cardiovascular Gaucher disease, mostly affects your heart. Cardiovascular Gaucher\xa0disease (type 3c). This rare type causes symptoms like: Hardening of the heart valves and blood vessels Bone disease Enlarged spleen Eye problems', ""Gaucher Disease Diagnosis When you go to your doctor, they might ask: When did you notice your symptoms? What's your family's ethnic background? Have past generations of your family had similar medical problems? Did any children in your extended family pass away before age 2? If your doctor thinks it's Gaucher\xa0disease, they can confirm that with a blood or saliva test. They'll also do tests regularly to track the condition. You may have an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan to see if your liver or spleen is swollen. You might also get a bone density test to check for any loss of bone. When Gaucher\xa0disease runs in your family, blood or saliva tests can help you find out if you could pass the disease to your child."", ""Questions for Your Doctor If you just found out that you or your child has Gaucher\xa0disease, it's natural to have lots of questions and concerns about what to expect. Some things you may want to ask your doctor include: Will the symptoms change over time? If so, how? Which treatments are best? Do these treatments have side effects? What can I do about them? Is there a clinical trial that could help? Are there new symptoms I should watch for? How often do I need to see you? Are there other specialists I should see? Does having this disease mean I have a higher chance of getting other diseases? Should I add my name to a Gaucher\xa0disease registry? If I have more children, what are the chances they'll have Gaucher\xa0disease?"", 'Gaucher Disease Treatment How your doctor treats Gaucher\xa0disease depends on several things. Some treatments can only be used by adults. Others are designed for a specific type of Gaucher. If your symptoms are mild, you may not need any treatment.', ""Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is one choice for people who have type 1 and some with type 3. It helps ease anemia , build bone strength to ease pain and avoid breaks, and shrinks an enlarged spleen or liver. ERT doesn't work as well if you have type 3 disease that gives you brain or nervous system problems like seizures. That's because the drug can't get from your blood into your brain."", ""Enzyme replacement therapy medications include: Imiglucerase ( Cerezyme ) Taliglucerase alfa ( Elelyso ) Velaglucerase alfa ( VPRIV ) These are IV drugs. The medicine drips into your vein through a small tube. You'll get this treatment every 2 weeks at the doctor's office in a session that takes 1 to 2 hours. Other medications for type 1 are eliglustat ( Cerdelga ) and miglustat ( Zavesca ). You take them as pills. They curb the process in your body that leads to fat buildup when you have an enzyme shortage. Eliglustat is a newer drug you take twice a day. It may not work well for people whose bodies break down the drug too quickly. Miglustat is for adults with mild to moderate type 1 Gaucher who weren't helped by ERT. You swallow a capsule three times a day."", ""There's no treatment that can stop type 3 from damaging the brain, but researchers are always looking for new ways to fight the disease. Other treatments that can help symptoms are: Blood transfusions for anemia Medications to strengthen your bones, prevent the buildup of fat, and ease pain Joint replacement surgery to help you move better Surgery to remove a swollen spleen Stem cell transplant to reverse type 1 symptoms. This procedure is complicated and can cause both short-term and long-term problems, so it's rarely used. Pain treatments. Kids and adults with Gaucher may take drugs like acetaminophen or ibuprofen for mild pain or opioids for stronger pain. Antidepressants, anti-anxiety drugs, and muscle relaxers may also help with pain. Vitamin D, calcium, or other supplements may help ease Gaucher symptoms too. Your doctor may recommend them if they think you're not getting enough in your diet."", ""What to Expect Because the disease is different for each person, you'll need to work with your doctor to make sure you're getting the right care. Treatment can help you feel better and might help you live longer. You might consider joining a clinical trial . Scientists use them to study new methods to treat Gaucher\xa0disease. These trials test new drugs to see if they're safe and if they work. They often are a way for people to try new medicine that isn't available to everyone. Your doctor can tell you if one of these trials might be a good fit."", ""If your child has Gaucher, they might not grow as quickly as other kids. They might be late in reaching puberty. Depending on your symptoms, they may need to avoid contact sports or limit your movement. Some people have very bad pain and fatigue. It may take extra effort to be active. Little things can make a big difference, though. For example, wheelchairs or crutches can help when you're having trouble walking. Naps are also useful. If you have serious symptoms, you may need help every day and might not be able to live alone. Whether you have the disease or are caring for someone who has it, this is a tough condition to manage. When you get the support of others who face the same challenges, it can help you feel less isolated. Sharing information and tips can help make your daily life easier. Think about getting professional counseling. It might also help you manage your feelings and frustrations about living with Gaucher\xa0disease."", 'Getting Support You can get information on resources and support groups from the National Gaucher Foundation. The organization has a mentor program that lets you connect with others who have the disease to share experiences and ideas for living with your condition.']"

Do these things until you can get to a doctor: Stop the bleeding Sit up -- don't lie down or lean back. Your nose needs to stay higher than your heart . Lean forward so that the blood won't run into the back of your throat. Pinch the soft part of your nose with your thumb and index finger, and hold it tightly for 5 minutes. If the bleeding hasn't stopped, pinch your nose again for 10 more minutes. Ease the pain Take over-the-counter pain medicine as directed on the package (like acetaminophen or ibuprofen) as needed. Sleep with your head propped on extra pillows. Reduce the swelling Wrap an ice pack in a towel. Place it on your nose for 10 minutes, then remove for 10 minutes. Repeat.

Put an ice pack or cold compress on your nose at least four times per day for the first 2 days after you get hurt."", 'Broken Nose Diagnosis To find out if your nose is broken, your doctor probably will: Ask about how the injury happened Put gentle pressure on the outside of your nose and the area around it Look inside your nose See if you have any bruising, cuts, or swelling Examine your eyes, jaw, and teeth X-rays and other types of scans aren’t usually needed to diagnose a broken nose, but your doctor might recommend them if they think you could have other injuries.', ""Broken Nose Treatment If your doctor confirms that your nose is broken, they'll likely wait for the swelling to go down before deciding whether or not it needs to be fixed. If it does, they'll choose to fix it either with surgery or without. They'll know what's best, based on your injuries. Here's what you can expect from both procedures. Manual realignment If your doctor decides your nose can be fixed without surgery, they'll have to do it within 1 to 2 weeks of your accident. If they wait any longer, the injury will begin to heal on its own, even if the bones are out of place."", ""Your doctor will give you pain medication before the procedure. Then, they'll open your nostrils with a flat tool called a speculum. They'll use a special instrument to align your broken bones and cartilage back in place. Your doctor will use packing inside your nose. They'll also put a dressing on the outside. That'll keep your nose in place while it heals. They may give you antibiotics to prevent infection. Surgery Your doctor probably will choose this option if your nasal fracture is severe or has gone untreated for more than 2 weeks. The goal is to put your bones back in their proper place and reshape your nose, if necessary. You'll get pain medication for the procedure. You might also have to have nasal surgery to fix any breathing problems. In many cases, you can go home the day of surgery. But you may have to stay home for about a week due to swelling and bruising.""]"
38,Nosebleeds,"['Why Is My Nose Bleeding? Several things can trigger a nosebleed. The most common cause is dry air, either from having the heat on in winter or being in a hot, low-humidity climate. Other causes include: Picking your nose Blowing your nose too hard often Injuries caused by a fall or getting hit in your nose Side effects of medication, like blood thinners Allergies High altitudes, where the air is thin', 'How Do I Stop My Nosebleed? Nosebleeds usually aren’t serious. You can treat most by yourself at home by doing the following: Stay calm . If you start to get nervous, it can actually make you bleed more. Try to relax. Sit up, don’t lie down. Keep your head above your heart. Lean a little bit forward . This keeps the blood from draining down the back of your throat. Pinch your nostrils closed . Use your thumb and index finger to hold your nostrils closed for 5 to 10 minutes while you breathe through your mouth. This puts pressure on the part of your nose that’s bleeding and can make the blood stop flowing.', 'Once the bleeding has stopped, do not touch or blow your nose. This may start it bleeding again. But if it does restart, gently blow your nose to get rid of any blood clots. You can also spray a decongestant such as oxymetazoline (Afrin,\xa0Mucinex,\xa0or Vicks Sinex) in both nostrils. Then pinch your nostrils shut and breathe through your mouth for 5 to 10 minutes. Call your doctor if: You fell or hit your nose on something You get nosebleeds often Your nosebleed lasts longer than 20 minutes even after you put pressure on it There’s so much bleeding that it’s hard to breathe. You’re taking blood thinners , such as warfarin (Coumadin), dabigatran (Pradaxa), rivaroxaban (Xarelto), fondaparinux sodium (Arixtra), or aspirin, or you have a bleeding disorder. If your doctor can’t get your nosebleed to stop with pressure, they might try: Cauterization. This procedure burns a blood vessel closed. After your doctor numbs your nose, they’ll use either a heated electronic device (an electrocautery) or a chemical called silver nitrate to close the leaky blood vessel. Packing. Your doctor puts a latex balloon or gauze into your nostril. This puts a lot of pressure on a blood vessel until it closes.', 'How to Prevent Nosebleeds You can’t always prevent nosebleeds from happening, but there are certain things you can do to help lower your chances of getting them: Keep the inside of your nose moist. Dryness can cause nosebleeds. Use a cotton swab to gently smear a thin layer petroleum jelly in your nostrils three times a day, including before you go to sleep. You can also use an antibiotic ointment like Bacitracin or Polysporin. Use a saline nasal product. Spraying it in your nostrils helps keep the inside of your nose moist. Use a humidifier. Your nostrils might be dry because the air in your house is dry. Don’t smoke. Smoking can irritate the inside of your nose and dry it out. Don’t pick your nose. Also, don’t blow or rub it too hard. If your child is getting nosebleeds, keep their fingernails short and discourage them\xa0from picking their\xa0nose. Don’t use cold and allergy medications too often. These can dry out your nose. In some cases, certain medications can cause nosebleeds or make them worse. You may need to discuss your medications with your doctor. But keep taking them unless your doctor tells you to stop.']"
39,Pain Relief: How NSAIDs Work,"[""NSAIDs -- or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs -- are among the most common pain relief medicines in the world. Every day more than 30 million Americans use them to soothe headaches, sprains, arthritis symptoms, and other daily discomforts, according to the American Gastroenterological Association. And as if that wasn't enough, in addition to dulling pain NSAIDs also lower fever and reduce swelling. But how do those little pills do so much? And if they're so good in some ways, why do they also raise the risk of heart problems in some people? The answer is complicated. Even researchers don't fully understand how NSAIDs work. Nonetheless, with the benefits and risks of NSAIDs in the headlines frequently, WebMD turned to four experts for a rundown of what researchers do know. Our panel consisted of: Byron Cryer, MD, a spokesman for the American Gastroenterological Association and an associate professor of medicine at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. Nieca Goldberg, MD, a spokeswoman for the American Heart Association and chief of Women's Cardiac Care at Lennox Hill Hospital in New York. John Klippel, MD, president and CEO of the Arthritis Foundation in Atlanta. Scott Zashin, MD, clinical assistant professor at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas and author of Arthritis Without Pain . Here is their explanation of how NSAIDs help ease your pain -- and sometimes cause side effects in the process."", 'What Is Pain? First, it helps to understand what pain is. On a basic level, pain is the result of an electrical signal being sent from your nerves to your brain . But the process is not only electrical. When you get injured -- say with a sprain -- the damaged tissue releases chemicals called prostaglandins, which are like hormones. These prostaglandins cause the tissue to swell. They also amplify the electrical signal coming from the nerves. Basically, they increase the pain you feel.', 'How Do NSAIDs Help Relieve Pain? NSAIDs work on a chemical level. They block the effects of special enzymes -- specifically Cox-1 and Cox-2 enzymes. These enzymes play a key role in making prostaglandins. By blocking the Cox enzymes, NSAIDs stop your body from making as many prostaglandins. This means less swelling and less pain.', 'Most NSAIDs block both Cox-1 and Cox-2 enzymes. They include the over-the-counter drugs: Aspirin ( Bufferin , Bayer, and Excedrin) Ibuprofen ( Advil , Motrin , Nuprin ) Ketoprofen ( Actron , Orudis ) Naproxen ( Aleve )', 'Other NSAIDs are available by prescription. They include: Daypro Indocin Lodine Naprosyn Relafen Vimovo Voltaren Aspirin has some benefits that other NSAIDs do not. The biggest is that aspirin works against the formation of blood clots . As a result, you are less likely to form the clots that can cause heart attacks and strokes. Other NSAIDs do not have this effect. Cox-2 inhibitors are a newer form of prescription NSAID. As you might guess, they only affect Cox-2 enzymes and not Cox-1. Two of them -- Bextra and Vioxx -- are no longer sold because of concerns about their side effects. The third, Celebrex , is still available.', ""What Are the Side Effects from Standard NSAIDs? Most people who use NSAIDs don't have any serious problems with them. But in some -- especially those who need pain relief regularly -- there can be a downside. When you swallow a pill, it affects your whole system, not just the part that hurts. So while an NSAID may do a great job of easing your pain, it may also be having other effects -- some of them unwanted -- in other parts of your body. Gastrointestinal Problems"", ""The most common risk of standard NSAIDs is that they can cause ulcers and other problems in your esophagus , stomach , or small intestine. Why? NSAIDs prevent the creation of prostaglandins, the hormone-like chemicals that cause swelling and increase pain. But that's not all that prostaglandins do. There are actually many different types of prostaglandins in your body. One type of prostaglandin helps protect the lining of the stomach and GI tract. And the Cox-1 enzyme helps make this prostaglandin. Since regular NSAIDs block Cox-1 enzymes, they slow down the manufacture of this prostaglandin. This is why standard NSAIDs cause high rates of gastrointestinal problems. With its defenses down, your GI tract becomes irritated and damaged by normal gastric acids. High Blood Pressure and Kidney Damage How can NSAIDs affect your blood pressure ? NSAIDs reduce the blood flow to the kidneys , which makes them work more slowly. When your kidneys are not working well, fluid builds up in your body. The more fluid in your bloodstream, the higher your blood pressure. It's that simple."", ""If you take NSAIDs in high doses, the reduced blood flow can permanently damage your kidneys. It can eventually lead to kidney failure and require dialysis . Allergic Reactions NSAIDs can also cause extreme allergic reactions, especially in people with asthma. Experts aren't sure why. Many specialists recommend that people who have asthma stay away from any NSAID, especially if they have sinus problems or nasal polyps ."", ""How Are Cox-2 inhibitors Like Celebrex Different? Cox-2 Inhibitors are a type of NSAID, and generally they work in similar ways. They are no better or worse at relieving pain. They have most of the same risks. But there is a vital difference. Cox-2 inhibitors were specifically designed to avoid the gastrointestinal problems common to other NSAIDs. Most NSAIDs affect levels of both Cox-1 and Cox-2 enzymes. Cox-2 inhibitors only block the Cox-2 enzyme. So these drugs don't affect the prostaglandins that protect the lining of your GI tract. Cox-2 inhibitors offer the same pain relief as standard NSAIDs, but a much lower risk of gastrointestinal problems."", 'What Are the Risks of Cox-2 Inhibitors? In a normal body, the levels of Cox-1 and Cox-2 enzymes are naturally in balance. When you block one but not the other, unexpected things can happen. It turns out that the Cox-1 enzymes also help make a chemical that encourages blood clotting and tightens the arteries . Normally, these nasty effects are kept in check by another chemical called prostacyclin. But prostacyclin is made, in part, with the help of Cox-2 enzymes -- the enzymes that drugs like Celebrex block. Blocking only Cox-2 upsets the balance of these enzymes. Levels of prostacyclin go down, the influence of Cox-1 goes unchecked, and your risk of heart attacks and strokes goes up. This is why Cox-2 inhibitors have been linked to an increased risk of heart attacks and strokes. The dangers were considered so high for the drug Vioxx that it was taken off the market. Bextra, another Cox-2 inhibitor, was also removed from the market partly because of the same risk.']"
40,Setting Up a Safe Nursery,"[""Wow, your baby is going to come home soon! Are you ready? Some of your decisions for setting up the nursery may be easy, like using your childhood dresser. But others may be harder to make. Where should everything go? What looks best? What's safest?"", ""Where to Put Your Baby's Crib The best place to put the crib is near the door of your baby's room so you can quickly reach them when you're stumbling around in the middle of the night, or in case of an emergency. Also, follow these safety guidelines as you place the crib. Never put your baby's crib near a window. Babies and toddlers can get caught in drapes or window blind cords -- even fall through window screens. Clear the crib area. Place cribs as far away from all electrical cords as possible. Also, don't put a crib under shelves or anything heavy that could fall off the wall and onto your baby. Don't hang anything near your baby's crib with strings or ribbons. These are choking hazards. That includes crib mobiles -- even they need to be hung out of your baby's reach. Remove them altogether when you baby is able to sit up. Having twins? The American Academy of Pediatrics says it's OK for newborn twins to share a crib, but as they get bigger and squirmier, they'll need separate sleep spaces.\xa0 Be sure to use these same tips when it's time to place your second crib."", ""Practical and Safe Furniture Arrangement The changing table is most efficient near\xa0the crib. Don't put all your changing supplies under the table. Instead, put some in a place where they are easy to reach.\xa0You may want to have changing supplies in other areas of the house as well for convenience. You'll probably find it most convenient if your chair or rocker is also near the crib and door. You won't have far to go to transfer your sleeping baby, and you can make a quick getaway afterwards. Your sweet, tiny newborn won't be moving around alone. But think ahead -- your toddler will. And one thing most toddlers love to do is climb . This means you need to secure all tall and heavy furniture to the walls using furniture straps.

If your baby's toys are in a toy box, make sure the top has a spring-loaded support so that it can't slam down on little heads or hands. Most newly purchased toy chests will have these, but you may need to update hand-me-downs. Last but not least, remember these two essential elements for your baby's room: a working smoke alarm and carbon monoxide detector!""]"
41,Vitamin D Deficiency,"[""If you shun the sun, wear sunscreen, suffer from milk allergies, or adhere to a strict vegan diet, you may be at risk for vitamin D deficiency. Known as the sunshine vitamin, vitamin D is produced by the body in response to skin being exposed to sunlight. It also occurs naturally in a few foods -- including some fish, fish liver oils, and egg yolks -- and in fortified dairy and grain products. Vitamin D is essential for strong bones because it helps the body use calcium from the diet. Traditionally, vitamin D deficiency has been associated with rickets, a disease in which the bone tissue doesn't properly mineralize, leading to soft bones and skeletal deformities. But increasingly, research is revealing the importance of vitamin D in protecting against a host of health problems."", 'Symptoms and Health Risks of Vitamin D Deficiency Symptoms of bone pain and muscle weakness can mean you have a vitamin D deficiency. However, for many people, the symptoms are subtle. Yet, even without symptoms, too little vitamin D can pose health risks. Low blood levels of the vitamin have been associated with the following: Increased risk of death from cardiovascular disease Cognitive impairment in older adults Severe asthma in children Cancer Research suggests that vitamin D could play a role in the prevention and treatment of a number of different conditions, including type1 and type 2 diabetes, hypertension, glucose intolerance, and multiple sclerosis .', ""Causes of Vitamin D Deficiency Vitamin D deficiency can occur for a number of reasons: You don't consume the recommended levels of the vitamin over time . This is likely if you follow a strict vegan diet, because most of the natural sources are animal-based, including fish and fish oils, egg yolks, fortified milk, and beef liver. Here are the best vitamin d foods for vegetarians. Your exposure to sunlight is limited. Because the body makes vitamin D when your skin is exposed to sunlight, you may be at risk of deficiency if you are homebound, live in northern latitudes, wear long robes or head coverings for religious reasons, or have an occupation that prevents sun exposure. During the winter, vitamin D deficiency can be more prevalent because there is less sunlight available."", ""You have dark skin. The pigment melanin reduces the skin's ability to make vitamin D in response to sunlight exposure. Some studies show that older adults with darker skin are at high risk of vitamin D deficiency."", ""Your kidneys cannot convert vitamin D to its active form. As people age, their kidneys are less able to convert vitamin D to its active form, thus increasing their risk of vitamin D deficiency. Your digestive tract cannot adequately absorb vitamin D. Certain medical problems, including Crohn's disease , cystic fibrosis, and celiac disease can affect your intestine's ability to absorb vitamin D from the food you eat. You are obese. Vitamin D is extracted from the blood by fat cells, altering its release into circulation. People with a body mass index of 30 or greater often have low blood levels of vitamin D."", 'Tests for Vitamin D Deficiency The most accurate way to measure how much vitamin D is in your body is the 25-hydroxy vitamin D blood test. A level of 20 nanograms/milliliter to 50 ng/mL is considered adequate for healthy people. A level less than 12 ng/mL indicates vitamin D deficiency.', ""Treatment for Vitamin D Deficiency Treatment for vitamin D deficiency involves getting more vitamin D -- through diet and supplements. Although there is no consensus on vitamin D levels required for optimal health -- and it likely differs depending on age and health conditions -- a concentration of less than 20 nanograms per milliliter is generally considered inadequate, requiring treatment. Guidelines from the Institute of Medicine increased the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) of vitamin D to 600 international units (IU) for everyone ages 1-70, and raised it to 800 IU for adults older than age 70 to optimize bone health. The safe upper limit was also raised to 4,000 IU. Doctors may prescribe more than 4,000 IU to correct a vitamin D deficiency. If you don't spend much time in the sun or always are careful to cover your skin ( sunscreen inhibits vitamin D production), you should speak to your doctor about taking a vitamin D supplement, particularly if you have risk factors for vitamin D deficiency.""]"
