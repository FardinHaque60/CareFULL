0,Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease,"What Is Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease? Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease ( CJD ) is a very rare disorder that causes the brain to break down. Also called ""classic"" CJD, it worsens quickly. Most people die within a year of getting it. The disease destroys brain cells. Seen through a microscope, it makes the brain look like a sponge. Classic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is not the same as “ mad cow disease ,"" which only happens in cattle. It's also not linked to ""variant"" CJD, which comes from products made from cattle that had mad cow disease . Causes There are three types of classic CJD. Each has a different cause: Sporadic: This is the most common type. It's caused by harmful proteins in the body called prions. Prion proteins are a normal part of your body. But sometimes they can fold the wrong way as they form. This “misfolded” prion infects the brain and destroys brain cells. Scientists don’t know why this happens. Familial: This happens in people who inherit a bad gene from a parent. Only 10% to 15% of CJD cases each year are familial. Acquired: The rarest form, It happens when someone comes into contact with a medical instrument (like a scalpel), organ (by transplantation), or growth hormone that’s infected with CJD. It makes up less than 1% of classic CJD cases. Symptoms The symptoms start and worsen very quickly. People with CJD often have signs of dementia , including: Confusion Trouble walking Jerky muscle movements or twitching Personality changes Trouble with memory and judgment Vision problems Sometimes people with it have trouble sleeping or become depressed. In later stages of the disease, they often lose the ability to speak or move. They may also get pneumonia or other infections, or slip into a coma . Diagnosis There is no single test for CJD. Doctors diagnose it from your symptoms. One sign of the disease is how fast it gets worse. A few tests doctors can use include: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This brain scan puts together detailed images. Doctors use these images to see changes in the brain over time. Electroencephalogram ( EEG ). This is another type of test using surface electrodes that measures the electrical activity in the brain. Lumbar puncture ( spinal tap ). Doctors use a long, very thin needle to draw some of the fluid out of the spinal column to test for certain proteins. The only way to know for sure someone has CJD is by taking a sample (called a biopsy ) of their brain tissue, or by autopsy. Doctors don’t usually biopsy brain tissue, because it’s risky, both for the patient and the doctor. It’s hard to target which tissue in the brain is infected, so doing a biopsy may not give helpful information. And it puts the doctor at risk of getting the disease. Since a positive diagnosis doesn't help someone with CJD, doctors often confirm cases only after someone dies of it. Treatment There are no treatments for CJD. Researchers have tested several drugs, but none have been able to slow or stop the disease. Doctors can prescribe pain medicine for the symptoms. Muscle relaxers or anti- seizure drugs can help with stiffness. People with CJD need full-time care once the disease is in its late stage."
1,What Is Chondrodysplasia?,"The term “chondrodysplasia” includes a number of conditions that are caused by changes in the genes. They’re often linked to dwarfism , which stunts the growth of many parts of the body, especially the bones. Doctors usually diagnose it in babies. People with some types of chondrodysplasia are able to lead normal lives with few limitations, if any. Other types can cause both physical and mental disabilities. One of the most common types -- achondroplasia -- usually has very few limitations, except perhaps some physical ones. Most people can live a full life with it. Actor Peter Dinklage, who plays Tyrion Lannister in the HBO series “Game of Thrones,” was born with achondroplasia. At the other end of the spectrum are severe and painful forms of chondrodysplasia, such as rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata (RCDP1). This condition stunts growth in babies, causing bone problems, mental disabilities, and cataracts . Most people with it don’t live past childhood. But there is hope. Researchers are working on possible treatments from RCDP1, although they are still in the early stages. Causes Chondrodysplasias are genetic, which means they happen because of problems in genes. A child might inherit these gene flaws from parents. That’s the case with RCDP1. Achondroplasia usually happens due to a mutation in a certain gene, which a child could inherit. But more often, it happens randomly. Symptoms Beyond a person’s physical appearance -- such as short stature and a large head -- symptoms depend on what type of chondrodysplasia someone has. Some may have mental disabilities because of problems with brain development. But others do not. With other forms of chondrodysplasia, symptoms can include rough and scaly skin , a cleft palate , and deformities of the spinal cord. Some children develop cataracts , causing poor vision . Diagnosis Usually, a doctor would notice chondrodysplasia when a baby is born. The hallmarks of the condition, such as short limbs and a large head, are easy to spot. X-rays could show that the bones in the child’s arms and legs are unusually short in length and broad in width. A number of measurements of the bones in X-ray images will show they are abnormal in size. Doctors can usually also diagnose achondroplasia using ultrasound while the baby is still in the womb. There is also a genetic test that can confirm the diagnosis. Treatment Your child’s treatment will depend upon what type of chondrodysplasia they have. Most treatments don't increase your child’s height, but they could relieve other problems. If your baby has achondroplasia and is healthy, you might only need to keep in touch with your pediatrician to make sure your child is doing well and address any complications along the way. If your child has a severe form, you’ll work with a number of specialists, from physical therapists to nutritionists, and a lot of that care may happen at a hospital. In some rare cases, growth hormones have helped with bone development in people with chondrodysplasia, but it’s not a guaranteed treatment. Growth hormones don’t cure achondroplasia, and in many cases patients do not respond to any form of drugs. Some people with dwarfism may choose to have extended limb lengthening. This surgery is controversial because there are risks and it can be painful. Many times, the child only gains a few inches of height. Surgeons re-cut the limbs to “stretch” the bones, and braces hold the bones in place. A successful treatment may take several surgeries. Because the procedures can be physically and emotionally stressful, doctors recommend holding off on the surgery until the person is old enough to decide for themselves. Complications Most forms of chondrodysplasia aren’t life-threatening. But there can be painful and long-term problems with breathing, as well as: Back pain Curvature of the spine Spinal stenosis Issues with the joints Lung infections Seizures Sleep apnea Doctors will work with you to treat and manage these. Support You may want to reach out to a support group for families of people with chondrodysplasia. These groups are designed to share information, hold meetings and raise money for a cure. Also, the Billy Barty Foundation has set up a scholarship fund to improve the quality of education for students who have achondroplasia. Most people with chondrodysplasia prefer not to be singled out, but people tend to stereotype them. Children with these conditions often are bullied. It’s a good idea for you to seek counseling that helps your child handle the condition -- and helps others understand it."
2,Understanding Encephalitis: The Basics,"What Is Encephalitis? Encephalitis (pronounced en-sef-uh- lie -tis) is inflammation of your brain tissue. It can be very serious and may cause personality changes, seizures , weakness, and other symptoms, depending on the part of your brain affected. Encephalitis is an inflammation in your brain. Most cases are caused by infection with a virus, such as the herpes simplex virus. (Photo Credit: Science Photo Library/Getty Images) Encephalitis is rare, affecting about 10-15 in 100,000 people each year in the U.S. Young children, older adults, and those with a weak immune system are most vulnerable. It's usually caused by an infection with viruses, bacteria, fungi, or parasites, although it can be caused by an autoimmune condition or some medicines as well. Most people who have mild encephalitis fully recover. Your treatment and chance of recovery depend on the cause and severity of your inflammation. In acute encephalitis, the infection directly affects your brain cells. In parainfectious encephalitis, your brain and spinal cord become inflamed within 1-2 weeks of contracting an infection (usually viral or bacterial) . Encephalitis vs. meningitis Encephalitis and meningitis are both diseases that cause inflammation in your brain. However, while encephalitis is an inflammation of your brain tissue, meningitis is an inflammation of the membranes that cover your brain and spinal cord (called meninges). Like encephalitis, meningitis is often caused by a viral or bacterial infection, but it can also be caused by fungal or parasitic infections, injuries, certain drugs, and some types of cancer. Is encephalitis contagious? Swelling in your brain isn’t contagious, but the causes can be. For example, viral encephalitis can be caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV) that can pass from person to person. Childhood diseases, such as measles, mumps, and German measles (Rubella), used to be a common cause of viral encephalitis in kids, but these causes are a bit rarer now since most people get vaccinated against them before they start school. Encephalitis Causes Viral infections with any of the following three groups of viruses are the most common cause of encephalitis. These include: Herpes viruses, which include HSV (especially HSV-1), chickenpox, cytomegalovirus, and Epstein-Barr virus Viruses that are transmitted through bugbites, such as West Nile virus , Dengue virus, and Eastern equine encephalitis virus Viruses that cause childhood infections, such as measles, mumps, and Rubella Less commonly, encephalitis may be caused by: Infection with HIV or the virus that causes rabies Bacterial and other infections, such as syphilis or toxoplasmosis (an infection with a parasite from infected cat poop) Autoimmune conditions Some kinds of cancer Some medicines Sometimes, your doctor may not be able to tell what caused your encephalitis. Encephalitis Types Infectious encephalitis It is usually caused by a viral infection but can also be caused by bacteria, fungi, and parasites. As it's usually caused by viral infections, it's more common in people who are exposed to bugs that can transmit diseases, such as people who spend a lot of time outdoors, especially near standing water. Infectious encephalitis can develop quickly and the symptoms can be serious. Autoimmune encephalitis It is usually caused by proteins that your body makes in your brain. These proteins cause inflammation in your brain. Doctors don't yet know for sure why some people develop these proteins, while other people don't. Autoimmune encephalitis tends to develop more slowly than infectious encephalitis and may cause more neurological symptoms, such as confusion, memory issues, and seizures. It's also rarer than infectious encephalitis. Some conditions that are linked to autoimmune encephalitis include: Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis Hashimoto’s encephalopathy LGI1/CASPR2-antibody encephalitis Limbic encephalitis Rasmussen’s encephalitis Both infectious and autoimmune encephalitis can cause serious, life-threatening symptoms. If you or someone else has neurological symptoms, such as irritability, seizures, or extreme drowsiness, call 911 or go to the emergency room right away. Encephalitis Symptoms Your symptoms depend on the type of encephalitis you have. People with infectious encephalitis may have symptoms of an infection before they get encephalitis. Signs of encephalitis can include: Fatigue or loss of energy Fever, especially a high fever Headache that can be severe Sensitivity to light and sound Mild-to-moderate neck stiffness Drowsiness or loss of consciousness Irritability, anxiety, and behavioral or personality changes Hallucinations Signs of severe encephalitis may include: Weakness or trouble moving some parts of your body Double vision Confusion, trouble speaking, or difficulty understanding when someone talks to you Coma Seizures A bulging soft spot (fontanel) in infants Go to the ER or call 911 right away if you or someone else has any signs of severe encephalitis. Encephalitis Diagnosis Your doctor will ask about your symptoms, including how long you've had them. Because people with encephalitis can be disoriented, family and friends are key to getting a good history. It's important to know if you've come into contact with mosquitoes or ticks , infected animals, or sick people. Your doctor will also do a physical exam and may order some tests. Encephalitis tests Some of the tests your doctor may use include: Blood tests, including a complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel Urine, stool, or sputum culture tests to see if you have an infection and what type you have Imaging tests, such as CT scans, MRI scans, and magnetoencephalography (MEG) to see where in your brain you are having seizures Electroencephalogram (EEG) to look for seizers or specific electrical activity in your brain Spinal tap (lumbar puncture) to remove cerebrospinal fluid to find infections in your brain or spinal cord A neurological exam, which is a series of tests that show how well your nervous system is working An intracranial pressure monitoring (ICP) to measure the pressure inside your skull Rarely, a biopsy of your brain tissue to look at under a microscope Encephalitis Risk Factors Several risk factors could increase your chance of getting encephalitis. These include: Age. Young children and older adults are at a higher risk for viral encephalitis. Some types of autoimmune encephalitis are more common in children and young adults. Having a weakened immune system. This could be because you have HIV, take medicines for cancer, or have a condition such as diabetes. Having an autoimmune condition. Smoking. Living in areas where mosquito- or tick-borne viruses spread easily, particularly in the summer months. Encephalitis Treatment Because the complications from encephalitis can be serious, you may need to go to the hospital. You will usually need monitoring for your blood pressure, heart rate, and breathing. You will also usually need IV fluid therapy to help keep your brain from swelling more. Otherwise, your treatment will depend on your age, condition, and the cause of your disease. Some common treatments include: Steroids that can help reduce swelling in your brain Antiviral drugs, such as acyclovir (Zovirax), Foscarnet (Foscavir), or Ganciclovir (Cytovene) for people who have viral encephalitis Antibiotics for people with bacterial encephalitis Anticonvulsant therapy for people with seizures Immune globulin and plasmapheresis for people with autoimmune encephalitis Over-the-counter medicines, such as acetaminophen, that can help control fever and headaches Supportive care Supportive care is a type of care for patients who are seriously ill. The goal is to focus your treatment on what is most important to you. This may involve, for instance, focusing on relieving your symptoms and how other treatments will affect how you feel. You usually get supportive care alongside specific treatments for your condition. Examples of supportive care may include: Use of a ventilator or other breathing help, such as an oxygen mask IV fluids to keep you hydrated Medications for pain, inflammation, infection, seizures, and other issues Post encephalitis therapy Once you have been treated for encephalopathy and the inflammation is gone, you may still need some treatment and support to continue your recovery. Some people need help such as: Physical therapy to help regain your muscle strength to stand, walk, or perform regular tasks. Occupational therapy (OT), which often works hand in hand with physical therapy. OT helps you work on your everyday skills and may give you ideas for adaptations, such as special tools, if you need help with some of your day-to-day activities. Speech therapy, which helps you regain or fine-tune your ability to speak or communicate clearly. Brain rehabilitation or retraining, which helps you improve your memory and your cognition. Psychotherapy, which helps you learn how to cope with changes in your life and manage your moods and behavior. Encephalitis Complications After you recover from the swelling in your brain, from encephalitis, you may have long-term damage in your brain that needs ongoing medical care. For instance, some people may have long-term problems, such as: Memory loss (amnesia) Personality and behavioral changes Emotional and psychological problems, such as anxiety, depression, and mood swings Problems with attention, concentration, planning, and problem-solving Repeated seizures (epilepsy) Hearing loss Speech and language problems Problems swallowing Problems with balance, coordination, and movement Long-term fatigue In severe cases, loss of consciousness (coma) and death Encephalitis Prevention The best way to avoid getting encephalitis is to avoid the germs that can cause it. Here are some tips: Get yourself and your kids vaccinated, as recommended by your doctors. The elimination of smallpox and the availability of vaccines that prevent mumps , measles , and rubella have lowered cases of encephalitis , especially in children. If you're traveling in an area that has a high risk of tick-borne or mosquito-borne viruses, make sure you get vaccinated before you head out. The CDC's website has a travelers' health page where you can look up your destination and get a list of all the recommended vaccines for that location. Wash your hands completely and often with soap and water throughout your day, especially before you handle food, eat or drink, and after using the bathroom. Don't share food, eating utensils, or glasses. Don't share personal-care items and remind your kids not to share their things, such as razors, towels, makeup, or toothbrushes. Take these steps to avoid getting bitten by mosquitoes and ticks: Avoid being outside between dusk and dawn when mosquitoes are most likely to bite you. If do have to be out then, wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants. Make sure mosquitoes can't get into your house through broken screens and windows. Also, run a fan, which can keep mosquitos moving around so they're less likely to land on and bite you. Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants when you're in wooded areas with tall grasses and shrubs, where ticks like to hang out. Check yourself, your kids, and your pets for ticks when they come inside during tick season (this can be year-round for people in the U.S. South and on the West Coast, but for most of the U.S., it's early spring to winter). Use bug repellent and insecticide. You can use the mosquito repellent DEET on both your skin and clothes. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recommends spraying your clothes, tents, and outdoor gear with products that contain permethrin to repel and kill both mosquitoes and ticks. Don't spray permethrin on your skin, though. For infants younger than 2 months, you can't use insect repellent, so cover their carrier or stroller with mosquito netting. For infants and children older than 2 months old, you can use 10%-30% DEET products. Don't use a combined sunscreen and DEET product because you'll need to reapply sunscreen for a full day of outside play. Reapplying a DEET-containing product can expose your child to high levels of DEET. Get rid of standing water outside your house. Mosquitoes lay their eggs in standing water. Common problem areas for standing water are old flowerpots, flat roofs, old tires, and clogged gutters. Report any sick or dying birds or small animals to your local health department. They could be infected with viruses such as West Nile virus that cause encephalitis. Encephalitis Prognosis Your symptoms can last anywhere from a few days to a couple of months. Some people with complications may take another few months to fully recover. However, with treatment, most people recover from encephalitis. Your outlook depends on a few things, such as: What caused your encephalitis. Some causes, such as an HSV infection, may cause fewer issues, so people with encephalitis caused by HSV may have an easier recovery than other people. Your level of inflammation. High levels of brain inflammation can cause more long-term issues that complicate your recovery. Your age. Adults may have a harder time recovering from encephalitis. Your overall health. If you have preexisting health issues or a weakened immune system, it can make your recovery more difficult. How long it took you to be diagnosed. The longer it takes you to get treatment, the higher your chance of having a difficult recovery and lasting complications. Takeaways Encephalitis is a condition that involves inflammation and swelling in your brain. It's usually caused by infection with a virus, especially HSV. It isn’t always preventable, but you can lower your risk by avoiding infection with a germ that could lead to encephalitis. This means getting your recommended vaccines and avoiding or protecting yourself when in areas that have ticks and mosquitoes. If you have signs or symptoms of encephalitis, you should get to the doctor right away. Quick diagnosis and treatment can make your recovery easier and limit lasting effects. Although some people do experience complications, most people fully recover. Encephalitis FAQs What is the life expectancy of people with encephalitis? Most people fully recover from encephalitis and go on to live a normal life. People with mild cases may recover in a week, while people with serious cases may have complications that take months of added recovery time. One study showed that about 5% of people who are hospitalized with encephalitis die while they are in the hospital. Can encephalitis resolve on its own? If you have mild encephalitis, it can recover on its own over several weeks. Severe cases of encephalitis, however, can be life-threatening. You can't necessarily tell from your symptoms how serious your case is, so if you suspect you have encephalitis, you need to go to the doctor."
3,Newborn Jaundice,"What Is Newborn Jaundice? It's a common and usually harmless condition in which your new baby's skin and eyes look yellow. It happens when too much bilirubin, a chemical that red blood cells release during their normal breakdown process, builds up in the blood. About 60% of full-term babies get jaundice in their first week. It's even more common – about 80% – in premature babies and can be more serious for them. Sometimes jaundice goes away on its own. Or your doctor may suggest light therapy or other treatment options. Newborn Jaundice Causes The most obvious sign of jaundice is a yellow color to the skin. But that can be hard to spot in babies with darker complexions. Instead, you might look for yellow in the whites of their eyes. (Photo Credit: Arindam Ghosh/Dreamstime) Some of your baby's red blood cells break down every day and create bilirubin, a waste pigment. It's the liver's job to filter it out of the bloodstream. When your baby is still in your womb, your liver clears out their bilirubin for them. After birth, your baby's liver takes over. Sometimes, your newborn's liver can't break down bilirubin quickly enough, and it starts to build up. Because bilirubin is a yellow compound, it turns your baby's skin and eyes yellow. Babies have a greater chance of getting jaundice if they’re: Born before 37 weeks Of East Asian or Mediterranean descent Are only breastfed or are having trouble feeding A younger sibling of a child who had jaundice Born to a mother with type O or Rh-negative blood The most common kind of newborn jaundice, called physiologic jaundice, happens because babies naturally have a high turnover of red blood cells in their first few days, and their growing livers can't keep up. It typically shows up 2-3 days after your baby is born and goes away on its own within the first couple of weeks. It's common for breastfed babies to have jaundice for a couple of reasons: Breastfeeding jaundice happens because your baby isn’t eating enough. Your milk may not have come in yet or your baby is having trouble latching on. The more your baby eats, the more quickly their body clears waste, including bilirubin, from their system. Breast milk jaundice appears after the first week. Doctors don’t know exactly why it happens, but they think something in breast milk keeps your baby’s liver from processing bilirubin well. This kind of jaundice can last for several months. More serious kinds of jaundice are caused by a disease or condition, such as: Hemorrhaging (bleeding) somewhere inside your baby's body Infection of the blood ( sepsis ) Bacterial or viral infections Liver problems Lack of certain enzymes Problem with red blood cells that makes them break too easily Jaundice may also happen if a mom has a different blood type from their baby. If that's your situation, your body may make antibodies that attack and break down your baby's red blood cells. In some cases, you can help prevent this by getting special shots when you're pregnant . Newborn Jaundice Symptoms The most obvious sign of jaundice is a yellow color to your baby's skin, which sometimes can be hard to tell on brown or darker skin. It may be easier to spot yellow in the whites of their eyes or under their tongue . Jaundice usually starts on the face. Once bilirubin levels in the blood rise, the yellow color moves to the chest and stomach , and then, finally, the legs and arms. Severe jaundice can be a medical emergency, so call your doctor right away if your baby: Isn’t eating or their diapers aren’t wet Is hard to wake up Won’t stop crying or is making a high-pitched cry Is limp or stiff with their back arched Moves their eyes strangely Newborn Jaundice Diagnosis Usually, a doctor can tell that your baby has jaundice by looking. But they’ll also want to know how much bilirubin is in your baby's blood to help decide on a treatment plan. They may: Take blood from your baby and send it to a lab to measure the level and kinds of bilirubin. Test your baby's skin with an instrument that measures bilirubin by shining a special light on them. If your doctor suspects that a condition is causing your baby's jaundice, they may do other tests, like: A urine sample to check for infection A complete blood count to measure the number of red blood cells A reticulocyte count to see if the number of newly formed red blood cells is normal A blood type test to see if the mother’s blood conflicts with the baby’s A Coombs test to see if the immune system is destroying the baby’s red blood cells A liver function test Newborn Jaundice Treatment In many cases, jaundice goes away on its own in 1 to 2 weeks. Your doctor will decide whether your baby should wait it out or start treatments, such as: Extra feedings. Taking in more breast milk or formula will help your baby poop more often, which can help clear out bilirubin from the body. Or, if your baby is having trouble breastfeeding , your doctor may recommend you feed them breast milk from a bottle or also feed them formula. Phototherapy . The doctor puts your baby under blue-green lights. It can help bilirubin leave their body in their urine. They'll wear only a diaper so that most of their skin can soak up the light. They’ll wear patches to protect their eyes. The light may come from a special pad or mattress that puts out blue-green light. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg). If your baby's jaundice happens because they have a different blood type from their mom, your doctor may need to give them a blood protein through an IV that helps stop the breakdown of red blood cells. Exchange transfusion. If your baby has severe jaundice that isn't getting better with other methods, they may need a blood transfusion called an exchange transfusion. In this process, your doctor repeatedly draws small amounts of your baby's blood and replaces it with blood from a donor. Your baby will need to stay in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) for the procedure. It's rare for babies to need this level of treatment for jaundice. Newborn Jaundice Complications Don’t wait to get your baby checked if you notice signs of jaundice. It’s rare, but if severe jaundice isn't treated, bilirubin can enter the brain and cause permanent damage. This condition is called kernicterus, which can lead to: Cerebral palsy Hearing loss Vision problems Seizures Developmental disabilities Newborn Jaundice Prevention There isn't much you can do to prevent the typical jaundice in newborns. But you can help move it along by being sure your baby is well fed. If you're breastfeeding, aim for 8-12 feedings a day in the first days of your baby's life. If you're formula feeding, offer 1-2 ounces every 2-3 hours. Exposing your baby to sunlight also helps break down indirect bilirubin. Sit by the window indoors with your baby, or take your baby for a stroll in the stroller if it's a nice day with sunshine."

5,What Is Biliary Atresia?,"Biliary atresia is a rare disease of the bile ducts that affects only infants. Bile ducts are pathways that carry a digestive fluid called bile from the liver to the small intestine. Once there, it breaks down fats and absorbs vitamins. It then filters waste out of the body. With biliary atresia, these ducts swell and become blocked. Bile is trapped in the liver , where it starts to destroy cells. Over time, the liver can be scarred -- a condition called cirrhosis . Once this happens, it can't filter out toxins the way it should. Some babies get it in the womb. But most often, symptoms appear between 2 and 4 weeks after birth. Causes Doctors believe a number of things may trigger biliary atresia, including: Change in a gene Problem with the immune system Problem with the way the liver or bile ducts develop in the womb Toxic substances Viral or bacterial infection after birth It isn't passed down from one family member to another, and babies can't catch it from someone else. Girls who are born prematurely are most at risk. So are Asian and African-American babies. Symptoms If your baby has biliary atresia, one of the first things you'll notice is that their skin and the whites of their eyes look yellow. This is called jaundice . Jaundice is very common among infants, especially in those born before 38 weeks, but it usually goes away in 2 to 3 weeks. Jaundice caused by biliary atresia lasts longer than that. Their abdomen also may swell, they'll have gray or white stools, and their pee will be dark. This happens because their liver can't process bilirubin -- a reddish-brown substance that's made when red blood cells break down. It's what gives poop its brown color. Some babies also might have frequent nosebleeds or intense itching . Diagnosis Many liver conditions have the same symptoms as biliary atresia. To make sure they find the right cause, your child's doctor may test their blood for high levels of bilirubin. They may also do some or all of the following: X-rays: A small amount of radiation creates a picture that's recorded on film or a computer. This checks for an enlarged liver and spleen . Ultrasound : High-frequency sound waves show detailed images of their organs. Liver scans: Special X-rays use chemicals to create an image of their liver and bile ducts. This can show if and where the flow of bile is blocked. Liver biopsy : Their doctor will take a small sample of tissue so it can be looked at under a microscope. This can show if it's likely they have biliary atresia and help rule out other liver problems such as hepatitis . Diagnostic surgery: They'll be given medicine to make them sleep , and their doctor will make a small cut in their stomach area so they can look at their liver and bile ducts. Treatment The most common treatment is the Kasai procedure. It's done if the blocked bile ducts are outside the baby 's liver. During the operation, your baby 's surgeon will replace the blocked bile ducts with part of their intestine. This lets bile drain from their liver through the new ""duct"" and into their intestine. If it's done before your baby is 3 months old, the surgery has about an 80% success rate. If it's not successful, babies usually need a liver transplant within 1 to 2 years. If the blocked bile ducts are inside the liver, medication may help get rid of bile, and vitamin A , D, and E supplements may be prescribed. But a liver transplant probably will be needed. Outlook If a baby has a successful Kasai procedure, they may recover and have a full, active life. But in most cases, they'll need specialized medical care for the rest of their life. Eventually, they may also need a liver transplant."
6,Causes of Stress,"The kids won't stop screaming, your boss has been hounding you because you turned a report in late, and you owe the IRS thousands of dollars you don't have. You're seriously stressed out. Stress is actually a normal part of life. At times, it serves a useful purpose. Stress can motivate you to get that promotion at work, or run the last mile of a marathon. But if you don't get a handle on your stress and it becomes long-term, it can seriously interfere with your job, family life, and health. More than half of Americans say they fight with friends and loved ones because of stress, and more than 70% say they experience real physical and emotional symptoms from it. Read on to learn why you get stressed out, and how that stress might be affecting your health. Causes of Stress Everyone has different stress triggers. Work stress tops the list, according to surveys. Forty percent of U.S. workers admit to experiencing office stress, and one-quarter say work is the biggest source of stress in their lives. Causes of work stress include: Being unhappy in your job Having a heavy workload or too much responsibility Working long hours Having poor management, unclear expectations of your work, or no say in the decision-making process Working under dangerous conditions Being insecure about your chance for advancement or risk of termination Having to give speeches in front of colleagues Facing discrimination or harassment at work, especially if your company isn't supportive Life stresses can also have a big impact. Examples of life stresses are: The death of a loved one Divorce Loss of a job Increase in financial obligations Getting married Moving to a new home Chronic illness or injury Emotional problems (depression, anxiety, anger, grief , guilt, low self-esteem) Taking care of an elderly or sick family member Traumatic event, such as a natural disaster, theft, rape, or violence against you or a loved one Sometimes the stress comes from inside, rather than outside. You can stress yourself out just by worrying about things. All of these factors can lead to stress: Fear and uncertainty. When you regularly hear about the threat of terrorist attacks, global warming, and toxic chemicals on the news, it can cause you to feel stressed, especially because you feel like you have no control over those events. And even though disasters are typically very rare events, their vivid coverage in the media may make them seem as if they are more likely to occur than they really are. Fears can also hit closer to home, such as being worried that you won't finish a project at work or won't have enough money to pay your bills this month. Attitudes and perceptions. How you view the world or a particular situation can determine whether it causes stress. For example, if your television set is stolen and you take the attitude, ""It's OK, my insurance company will pay for a new one,"" you'll be far less stressed than if you think, ""My TV is gone and I'll never get it back! What if the thieves come back to my house to steal again?"" Similarly, people who feel like they're doing a good job at work will be less stressed out by a big upcoming project than those who worry that they are incompetent. Unrealistic expectations. No one is perfect. If you expect to do everything right all the time, you're destined to feel stressed when things don't go as expected. Change. Any major life change can be stressful -- even a happy event like a wedding or a job promotion. More unpleasant events, such as a divorce, major financial setback, or death in the family can be significant sources of stress. Your stress level will differ based on your personality and how you respond to situations. Some people let everything roll off their back. To them, work stresses and life stresses are just minor bumps in the road. Others literally worry themselves sick. Effects of Stress on Your Health When you are in a stressful situation, your body launches a physical response. Your nervous system springs into action, releasing hormones that prepare you to either fight or take off. It's called the ""fight or flight"" response, and it's why, when you're in a stressful situation, you may notice that your heartbeat speeds up, your breathing gets faster, your muscles tense, and you start to sweat. This kind of stress is short-term and temporary (acute stress), and your body usually recovers quickly from it. But if your stress system stays activated over a long period of time (chronic stress), it can lead to or aggravate more serious health problems. The constant rush of stress hormones can put a lot of wear and tear on your body, causing it to age more quickly and making it more prone to illness. If you've been stressed out for a short period of time, you may start to notice some of these physical signs: Headache Fatigue Difficulty sleeping Difficulty concentrating Upset stomach Irritability When stress becomes long-term and is not properly addressed, it can lead to a number of more serious health conditions, including: Depression High blood pressure Abnormal heartbeat ( arrhythmia ) Hardening of the arteries ( atherosclerosis ) Heart disease Heart attack Heartburn, ulcers, irritable bowel syndrome Upset stomach -- cramps , constipation , and diarrhea Weight gain or loss Changes in sex drive Fertility problems Flare-ups of asthma or arthritis Skin problems such as acne, eczema, and psoriasis Managing your stress can make a real difference to your health. One study showed that women with heart disease lived longer if they underwent a stress management program."
7,Jock Itch,"What Is Jock Itch? Jock itch is an infection that’s caused by a fungus . It's a form of ringworm that likes to live in warm, moist places on your body. It’s also called tinea cruris. People who sweat a lot, who are overweight , or who have a skin condition called eczema are more likely to get it. It’s a common problem for male athletes, which is how it got its name. But you don’t have to play a sport or be a guy to get it. If untreated, jock itch (tinea cruris) can last for months. But antifungals available without a prescription can help clear it up in a few weeks. Jock Itch Symptoms It’s typically found on your groin, inner thighs, or anus . Symptoms include: Itching and burning A red, scaly, circular rash with raised edges Depending on your skin tone, the irritated skin could look purple, grey, tan, or white Cracking, flaking, or peeling skin Jock Itch Risk Factors You might get jock itch if you: Wear tight clothes that irritate your skin Have moisture in your groin area from sweating Wear a wet bathing suit for a long time Share damp towels or sweaty clothing with other people Have close contact with someone who has jock itch Are overweight Have a weakened immune system or diabetes Jock Itch Diagnosis Your doctor may be able to diagnose it by looking at the skin rash and hearing about your symptoms. Rarely, they might take a sample of skin so a technician can look at it under a microscope. Jock Itch Treatment If you don’t treat jock itch, it can last months. But over-the-counter medicines called antifungals can usually clear it up in a few weeks. They’re available in creams, powders, and sprays. Keep the area clean and dry. Take these steps for faster healing: Wash the area and then dry using a clean towel. Use a different towel on the rest of your body. Read the medicine label, and apply the medicine as directed. Use it for as long as recommended; the infection may come back if you stop sooner. Talk to your doctor if you aren’t feeling better in a couple of weeks. You might need stronger medicine. Jock Itch Prevention Good habits can lower your risk of getting jock itch: Bathe. Shower or take a bath daily and again after playing sports or working out . Stay dry. Pat your groin area dry with a clean towel. Ask your doctor about using an antifungal powder. Don’t share. Don’t let others use your towels or other personal items. Wear clean clothes. Wash workout clothes or sports uniforms after each use. Change your underwear every day, or more often if you sweat a lot. Make sure athletic supporters and cups are clean. Don't wear tight-fitting clothes and underwear. They can rub and chafe your skin and make you more prone to getting jock itch. Consider switching to boxers if you wear briefs. Other fungal infections, like athlete’s foot ( tinea pedis ), can also spread to your groin and cause jock itch. Take these steps to avoid that: Treat the infection with an antifungal medicine for athlete’s foot. Use a separate towel to dry your feet, or dry your groin before your feet . Put on socks before you put on underwear so it doesn’t touch your bare feet."
8,Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS),"What Is Stevens-Johnson Syndrome? Stevens-Johnson syndrome, also called SJS , is a rare but serious problem. Most often, it's a severe reaction to a medicine you've taken. It causes your skin to blister and peel off. It affects your mucous membranes, too. Blisters form inside your body, making it hard to eat, swallow, even pee. Getting treated right away helps protect your skin and other organs from lasting damage. SJS vs. TEN Stevens-Johnson syndrome is similar to a condition called toxic epidermal necrolysis, or TEN. TEN also causes your skin to slough off, and it's often a reaction of your immune system to a medication. It also can be caused by an infection, tumor, or vaccine. The main difference between SJS and TEN is scale. SJS usually affects 10% or less of your body's surface. TEN affects 30% or more. TEN is a life-threatening illness. About 25% of cases are fatal. SJS is much less lethal. The fatality rate is between 1% and 5%. Symptoms of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome Stevens-Johnson syndrome may feel like the flu at first. Then you'll get a rash that blisters, and your skin will peel. It can also affect your eyes and the inside of your mouth. (Photo Credit: Dr P. Marazzi/Science Source) SJS usually starts with a fever and feeling like you have the flu. A few days later, other symptoms appear, including: Painful red or purple skin that looks burned and peels off Blisters on your skin, mouth , nose, and genitals Red, painful, watery eyes The SJS rash is sometimes described as looking like a target: concentric circles that are lighter around the edges and darker in the center. SJS is dangerous. If you have these symptoms, go to the emergency room. Stevens-Johnson Syndrome Causes More than 100 drugs can cause SJS. Some of the most common are: Medicines for gout , a painful form of arthritis – especially allopurinol ( Aloprim , Zyloprim ) Pain relievers such as acetaminophen , ibuprofen , and naproxen sodium Sulfa antibiotics , a kind of drug that fights infections (including Bactrim and Septra ) Medicines that treat seizures or mental illness The medicines most likely to cause problems in kids are sulfa antibiotics , Tylenol, and drugs that treat seizures, especially carbamazepine ( Carbatrol , Tegretol ). If you're going to get SJS, it will most likely happen in the first 2 months you're taking a drug. An infection, like pneumonia or the herpes virus that causes cold sores , can also trigger SJS. This happens more often with kids than adults. Graft-versus-host disease, which you can get after a stem cell transplant, also can lead to SJS. You're more likely to get SJS if you have: HIV or other problems with your immune system, such as lupus Had SJS before Certain genes you inherit from your parents, especially a variation of a gene called human leukocyte antigen-B Radiation treatments Had a bone marrow transplant Sometimes, doctors can't pinpoint any specific cause for Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Stevens-Johnson Syndrome Diagnosis To figure out whether you have Stevens-Johnson syndrome, your health care provider will start by asking questions about your medical history, including any medications you've recently started or stopped taking. They'll also take a look at your rash. You may need more tests. They include: Skin biopsy, which involves removing a small sample of your skin. It will go to a lab to be tested. Culture, which involves removing skin, tissue, or fluid to send for testing. This can rule out infections that could be causing your condition. Imaging of your lungs to check for pneumonia, if your symptoms suggest it's causing your SJS Blood test, which involves taking a sample of your blood. It then goes to a lab to check for signs of infection. Your health care team also will look at your pain level, how fast the rash has spread, and how much of your skin is affected. Stevens-Johnson Syndrome Treatment You'll be treated for SJS in the hospital by a special team of doctors and nurses. Some people are treated in a burn center or intensive care unit. The first thing doctors will do is to stop the medication or treat the infection that made you sick. They'll also try to relieve your symptoms, prevent infections, and support your healing. Replace fluids and nutrients Your body needs to stay hydrated, and your skin needs protein to rebuild. You'll probably get fluids from an IV at first, then be fed through a tube that goes into your stomach through your nose. Wound care Hospital staff will keep your skin clean. They'll gently remove dead skin and cover bare patches with a special dressing. Eye care Your care team will clean your eyes and use special drops and creams to keep them from drying out. You could be in the hospital from 2 to 4 weeks. It takes time to recover from SJS, and most people do. Sometimes, SJS has effects that will show up years after you heal, including: Scars where your skin peeled Infections in your gums or mouth Lung problems such as bronchitis , which causes a bad cough and trouble breathing Stevens-Johnson Syndrome Complications Complications of SJS can include: Eye problems, including dry eyes, sensitivity to light, and long-term issues with your vision Pneumonia Shock Sepsis, which occurs when your entire body has an inflammatory reaction to an infection Multiple organ failure, in which more than one of your vital organs stop working properly. Those organs include your liver, kidneys, heart, brain, lungs, and small intestine. In the most serious cases, Stevens-Johnson syndrome can be fatal, but that's a relatively rare outcome. Other issues can crop up after you've recovered from SJS. Those longer-term problems might include: Sweating more than normal Dry or itchy skin Hair loss Losing your nails, or nails that are misshapen Changes to your sense of taste Dry mucous membranes that make it hard to pee Chronic fatigue Lung problems such as asthma or COPD Stevens-Johnson Syndrome Recovery Unless you get an infection, your skin will begin to heal in 2 to 3 weeks. You'll probably feel tired after you leave the hospital, and it might be weeks or months before you're feeling back to normal. If a medicine caused your SJS, you can't take it ever again. Stevens-Johnson Syndrome Prevention There's often no way to know how you'll react to certain medicines – even ones your doctor prescribes. If you're of Asian descent, you may have a gene that raises your risk of SJS. Talk to your doctor about getting tested for this gene before you take carbamazepine. If you've already had SJS, you can take steps to avoid getting it again: Tell your doctors you've had SJS. Wear a medical alert bracelet. Know the name of the medicine that caused your SJS. Avoid taking it or any drugs like it. Takeaways Stevens-Johnson syndrome starts out feeling like flu symptoms. Then you get a rash that blisters, turns into sores, and causes your skin to peel. It can affect your mucous membranes, too. It's usually a severe reaction to a medication. SJS is a dangerous disease that can have serious complications; it can be fatal. If you have it, you'll spend time in the hospital. Most people recover, although some have long-term complications. Stevens-Johnson Syndrome FAQs How serious is Stevens-Johnson syndrome? Stevens-Johnson syndrome is rarely fatal. But it's a serious disease that has to be treated in a hospital. You may need to be in intensive care or a burn unit. Almost everyone recovers from SJS, but some people have long-term complications that affect their skin, eyes, and lungs. How fast does Stevens-Johnson syndrome progress? SJS starts with a flu-like illness. Your eyes may burn, too. Then, in 1 to 3 days, a rash will appear on your skin and on your mucous membranes. With treatment, your skin will heal in 2 to 3 weeks. SJS can start up to 2 weeks after you've stopped taking the medication that triggered it. What can be mistaken for Stevens-Johnson syndrome? Some autoimmune diseases can cause your skin to blister, and that condition can look like SJS. It might also be confused with something called erythema multiforme major, another type of allergic reaction to medicine or infection."
9,Alopecia Areata,"What Is Alopecia? Alopecia areata is an autoimmune disorder that causes your hair to come out, often in clumps the size and shape of a quarter. The amount of hair loss is different in everyone. Some people lose it only in a few spots. Others lose a lot. Sometimes, hair grows back but falls out again later. In others, hair grows back for good. There are different types of this condition. Alopecia areata is most common in its main form, but there are other, more rare types: Alopecia areata totalis means you’ve lost all the hair on your head. Alopecia areata universalis is the loss of hair over your entire body. Diffuse alopecia areata is a sudden thinning of your hair rather than lost patches. Ophiasis alopecia areata causes hair loss in a band shape around the sides and back of your head. Alopecia Symptoms Alopecia areata (AA) is a chronic, autoimmune disease and while most associate it with temporary and permanent hair loss, it affects the nails in up to 46% of those affected. AA nails may appear pitted with lines, having splitting and/or white spots. The main and often the only symptom of alopecia is hair loss. You may notice: Small bald patches on your scalp or other parts of your body Patches may get larger and grow together into a bald spot Hair grows back in one spot and falls out in another You lose a lot of hair over a short time More hair loss in cold weather Fingernails and toenails become red, brittle, and pitted The bald patches of skin are smooth, with no rash or redness. But you may feel a tingling, itching , or burning sensation on your skin right before the hair falls out. Alopecia Causes and Risk Factors When you have an autoimmune disease , your immune system attacks your body. With alopecia areata, it’s the hair follicles that are attacked. Doctors don’t know why it happens. But they think people who get it have something in their genes that makes it more likely. Then something happens to trigger the hair loss. Learn more about what causes alopecia . You’re more likely to get alopecia areata if you have: A family member who has it Asthma Down syndrome Pernicious anemia Seasonal allergies Thyroid disease Vitiligo Alopecia Diagnosis If you think you have alopecia areata, you may want to see a skin specialist called a dermatologist. They will: Talk to you about your symptoms Take a close look at the areas where you have hair loss Pull gently on the hairs at the edges of the bald patch to see if they come out easily Check individual hairs and follicles to see if they’re abnormally shaped Examine your nails Rarely, you may have a biopsy , which means a small piece of skin is removed from your scalp and looked at under a microscope. Many conditions can cause hair loss. So your doctor may test your skin for a fungal infection or give you blood tests to check for thyroid , hormone , or immune system problems. Alopecia Treatment Alopecia areata can’t be cured. But it can be treated and hair can grow back. If you have it, there are several things to try: Corticosteroids . These are anti-inflammatory drugs that are prescribed for autoimmune diseases. They can be given as an injection into the scalp or other areas. They can also be given as a pill or rubbed on the skin as an ointment, cream, or foam. The downside is that it may take a long time to work. Topical immunotherapy . This is used when there’s a lot of hair loss or if it happens more than once. Chemicals are applied to the scalp to produce an allergic reaction . If it works, this reaction is actually what makes the hair grow back. It also causes an itchy rash and usually has to be repeated several times to keep the new hair growth. Minoxidil ( Rogaine ) . This treatment, which is put on the scalp, is already used for pattern baldness. It usually takes about 12 weeks before you see growth, and some users are disappointed in the results. Read more about which types of alopecia are most likely to respond to minoxidil . Other treatments for alopecia areata include medications that are sometimes used for other autoimmune disorders. These medicines have differing amounts of success in regrowing hair. Alopecia Home Care Apart from medications, there are other things you can try if you have alopecia areata. Wear wigs, hats, or scarves. They cover your hair loss and will protect your head from the sun. Reduce stress . Personal troubles seem to trigger alopecia areata, although this has not been proven scientifically. Telogen effluvium, another form of hair loss, can also be triggered by stress. Learn more about the signs and symptoms of telogen effluvium . Alopecia Outlook Alopecia areata isn’t usually a serious medical condition, but it can cause a lot of anxiety and sadness. Support groups are out there to help you deal with the psychological effects of the condition. If you lose all your hair, it could grow back. If it doesn’t, there are different ways to cover your hair loss and protect your scalp. If you notice sudden hair loss, always check with a doctor. There can be other reasons for it besides alopecia areata."
10,What Is Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis?,"If a child, or a teen younger than 16, has joint inflammation and stiffness for more than 6 weeks, it may be juvenile idiopathic arthritis , formerly called juvenile idiopathic arthritis. The inflammation can cause redness, swelling, warmth, and soreness in the joints. But some children who have it might not complain about the joint pain . The condition can affect any joint, and it may limit how well that joint works. Most children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis recover fully. With the right treatment, they’re likely to do well and live a normal life. Causes Juvenile idiopathic arthritis is an autoimmune disorder . This means that the immune system attacks healthy cells and tissues. That causes the inflammation . Researchers don't know exactly why it happens. But they think it's a two-step process. First, something in a child’s genes makes them more likely to get it. Then something else, like a virus, triggers the arthritis itself. How Is It Different From Adult Rheumatoid Arthritis? Adults who have it usually have symptoms all their lives. But studies show that by adulthood, 70% of children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis outgrow it. They don’t have symptoms anymore. Symptoms Besides joint pain , it may cause chronic fever and anemia , which is a shortage of red blood cells . It can also affect the heart , lungs , eyes , and nervous system . Flare-ups, times when it gets worse, can last for several weeks. Later on, symptoms may lessen. They include: Fevers of 103 F or higher Pink rash that comes and goes Eye inflammation Joint pain or stiffness Limping Swelling in joints Being less active Trouble with movements of hands or fingers, affecting things like handwriting or coloring Problems with bone development and growth Different Types of Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis There are three kinds. Each type is based on the number of joints involved, the symptoms, and certain antibodies that may be in the blood . Four or fewer joints are involved. Doctors call this pauciarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis. It’s the most common form. About half of all children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis have this type. It usually affects large joints like the knees . Girls under age 8 are most likely to get it. Some children with this type have special proteins in the blood called antinuclear antibodies . They are more likely to get eye diseases like iritis , which is inflammation of the iris, or colored part of the eye . They can also get uveitis , which is inflammation of the inner eye . These children need regular eye exams by an ophthalmologist, a doctor who specializes in eye diseases. Lots of children with this condition will outgrow it by adulthood. Still, eye problems can continue, and joint symptoms may come back. Five or more joints are involved. You may hear this called polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis. About 30% of all children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis have this type. It usually affects the small joints, like those in the hands and feet, but it can sometimes involve the large joints. This type of juvenile idiopathic arthritis is usually symmetrical. That means it affects the same joints on both sides of the body. Some children who have this have an immune system chemical called rheumatoid factor in their blood . They often have a more severe form of the condition. It affects much of the body. Doctors may call this form “systemic.” Signs of this include joint swelling , fever, and a light pink rash . It may involve the heart , liver , spleen , and lymph nodes. A small percentage of children who have it develop arthritis in their joints. They may have severe arthritis that lasts into adulthood. Diagnosis Juvenile idiopathic arthritis is often hard to diagnose. Sometimes children who have it do not complain of pain. In fact, parents may not be aware of symptoms. Some symptoms are similar to other serious conditions like infections, cancer , bone disorders, Lyme disease , and lupus . If a doctor thinks a child may have juvenile idiopathic arthritis, they will ask about symptoms and the family’s medical history. They will give the child a physical exam to look for joint swelling, rashes , signs of internal organ inflammation, and eye problems . They may also take samples of the child’s blood and joint fluid, and use X-rays or other tests. Treatment Treatment usually includes medications along with exercise . The goals are to: Stop inflammation Ease pain and swelling Strengthen joints and help them move better Prevent joint damage and other complications Medications Medications for juvenile idiopathic arthritis include: NSAIDS (Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs) The medicines can curb pain, fever, and inflammation. They come as a liquid or a pill. People usually take them from one to 4 times a day. Some common NSAIDs are aspirin , ibuprofen , naproxen , and tolmetin . While NSAIDs ease pain and inflammation, they also have side effects. These include stomach pain , nausea , vomiting , headache , and anemia . Sometimes your doctor will give you another stomach -protecting medication to take with the NSAIDs. This will make stomach bleeding less likely. If you child does not respond well to NSAIDS, the doctor may prescribe a new drug called Xatmep. Xatmep is the first ready-to-use oral solution formulation of methotrexate to be approved for use in children with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis . An aggressive therapy, this medicine helps reduce further joint damage and helps preserve joint function. Side effects can include dizziness, fatigue, chills and fever. Meds That Stop the Condition From Getting Worse Your doctor may prescribe “DMARDs,” which stands for Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs. They also help with joint stiffness , pain, and swelling. Examples include hydroxychloroquine ( Plaquenil ), methotrexate , and sulfasalazine ( Azulfidine ). It may take about 3 to 6 months for these medicines to work. Because these are strong drugs, your child will need frequent tests to check for side effects. They can include anemia , low blood count, and kidney and liver problems. Other possible problems could be stomach aches, diarrhea , vomiting , nausea , headaches , rashes, loss of appetite, and weakness . “Biologic” Drugs for Your Immune System These drugs are genetically engineered to work on the immune system. They include adalimumab ( Humira ), adalimumab-atto (Amjevita), a biosimilar to Humira, anakinra ( Kineret ), etanercept ( Enbrel ), etanercept -szzs (Ereizi), a biosimilar to Enbrel, infliximab ( Remicade ), and infliximab-dyyb (Inflectra), a biosimilar to Remicade. If you take them, you are more likely to get an infection, including serious diseases like tuberculosis . Some biologics are only approved by the FDA for use in adults. Check with your doctor about which ones are appropriate for children. If You Need Corticosteroids These are strong, anti-inflammatory drugs. Doctors usually prescribe them only if other treatments don’t work, or if the condition is severe. This type of steroid isn’t the kind that bulks up your muscles. Corticosteroids come in pills or liquids, and are usually prescribed for short periods of time and in low dosages. Serious side effects can happen if they’re taken too long. These include stunted growth, ulcers, mood swings, weight gain, "" moon face ,"" muscle weakness, high blood pressure , osteoporosis , cataracts , and infections. Examples of steroids include dexamethasone, hydrocortisone , methylprednisolone , prednisolone , and prednisone . Exercise Exercise and physical activity are important for children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Movement brings less pain, builds strength, and keeps joints moving well. With the help of physical and occupational therapists, children learn simple ways to do everyday things. Therapists teach them exercises to improve their flexibility and strength. It can help to use hot and cold treatments . For instance, a warm compress can loosen up a stiff muscle and an ice pack often reduces swelling and inflammation. Therapists can also make splints for children to correctly position their joints and reduce pain. They can be used on knees , wrists, and fingers, as well as at night during sleep. If your child has juvenile idiopathic arthritis, encourage them to get out there and be active. Avoid contact sports and instead go for things that are not stressful on the joints, like swimming . Complications Eye problems are linked to some forms of juvenile idiopathic arthritis, so keep up with your child’s eye tests . The condition can also cause problems with oral health if it affects the jaw and makes it hard to brush and floss teeth . Dentists can recommend special toothbrushes and floss to help children take care of their mouths. Temporomandibular joint ( TMJ ) or jaw pain sometimes happens with juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Certain exercises can help with jaw pain and stiffness. If the lower jaw doesn’t develop correctly, it can cause an overbite . An orthodontist can usually fix this. In some cases, surgery may be needed. You may also want to check with your child’s doctor about their weight. Some children with the condition may need more calories. Others gain too much weight because they have problems being active, or because of side effects from medication. Extra weight is hard on the joints."
11,Type 1 Diabetes,"What Is Type 1 Diabetes? Type 1 diabetes is a condition in which your immune system destroys insulin -making cells in your pancreas . These are called beta cells. The condition is usually diagnosed in children and young people , so it used to be called juvenile diabetes. A condition called secondary diabetes is like type 1 , but your beta cells are wiped out by something else, like a disease or an injury to your pancreas, rather than by your immune system. Both of these are different from type 2 diabetes , in which your body doesn’t respond to insulin the way it should. Type 1 Diabetes Symptoms Signs are often subtle, but they can become severe. They include: Extreme thirst Increased hunger (especially after eating) Dry mouth Upset stomach and vomiting Frequent urination Unexplained weight loss, even though you’re eating and feel hungry Fatigue Blurry vision Heavy, labored breathing (your doctor may call this Kussmaul respiration) Frequent infections of your skin , urinary tract, or vagina Crankiness or mood changes Bedwetting in a child who’s been dry at night Signs of an emergency with type 1 diabetes include: Shaking and confusion Rapid breathing Fruity smell to your breath Belly pain Loss of consciousness (rare) Type 1 Diabetes Causes Insulin is a hormone that helps move sugar, or glucose, into your body's tissues. Your cells use it as fuel. Damage to beta cells from type 1 diabetes throws the process off. Glucose doesn’t move into your cells because insulin isn’t there to do the job. Instead, it builds up in your blood , and your cells starve. This causes high blood sugar , which can lead to: Dehydration . When there’s extra sugar in your blood, you pee more. That’s your body’s way of getting rid of it. A large amount of water goes out with that urine , causing your body to dry out. Weight loss. The glucose that goes out when you pee takes calories with it. That’s why many people with high blood sugar lose weight. Dehydration also plays a part. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). If your body can't get enough glucose for fuel, it breaks down fat cells instead. This creates chemicals called ketones. Your liver releases the sugar it stores to help out. But your body can’t use it without insulin, so it builds up in your blood, along with the acidic ketones. This mix of extra glucose, dehydration, and acid buildup is known as ketoacidosis and can be life-threatening if not treated right away. Damage to your body. Over time, high glucose levels in your blood can harm the nerves and small blood vessels in your eyes , kidneys , and heart . They can also make you more likely to get hardened arteries , or atherosclerosis , which can lead to heart attacks and strokes. There’s no way to prevent type 1 diabetes. Doctors don't know all the things that cause it. But they know that your genes play a role. They also know that you can get type 1 diabetes when something around you, like a virus, tells your immune system to go after your pancreas . Most people with type 1 diabetes have signs of this attack, called autoantibodies. They’re there in almost everyone who has the condition when their blood sugar is high. Type 1 diabetes can happen along with other autoimmune diseases , like Graves’ disease or vitiligo. Type 1 Diabetes Risk Factors Only about 5% of people with diabetes have type 1. It affects males and females equally. You’re at higher risk of getting it if you: Are younger than 20 Are white Have a parent or sibling with type 1 Type 1 Diabetes Diagnosis If your doctor thinks you have type 1 diabetes, they’ll check your blood sugar levels. They may test your urine for glucose or chemicals your body makes when you don’t have enough insulin. Type 1 Diabetes Treatment People who have type 1 diabetes can live long, healthy lives. You’ll need to keep a close eye on your blood sugar levels . Your doctor will give you a range that the numbers should stay within. Adjust your insulin, food, and activities as necessary. Everyone with type 1 diabetes needs to use insulin shots to control their blood sugar. When your doctor talks about insulin, they’ll mention three main things: ""Onset"" is how long it takes to reach your bloodstream and begin lowering your blood sugar. ""Peak time"" is when insulin is doing the most work in terms of lowering your blood sugar. ""Duration"" is how long it keeps working after onset. Several types of insulin are available. Rapid-acting starts to work in about 15 minutes. It peaks about 1 hour after you take it and continues to work for 2 to 4 hours. Regular or short-acting gets to work in about 30 minutes. It peaks between 2 and 3 hours and keeps working for 3 to 6 hours. Intermediate-acting won’t get into your bloodstream for 2 to 4 hours after your shot. It peaks from 4 to 12 hours and works for 12 to 18 hours. Long-acting takes several hours to get into your system and lasts about 24 hours. Your doctor may start you out with two injections a day of two types of insulin. Later, you might need more shots. Most insulin comes in a small glass bottle called a vial. You draw it out with a syringe that has a needle on the end and give yourself the shot. Some kinds come in a prefilled pen. Another kind is inhaled. You can also get it from a pump, a device you wear that sends it into your body through a small tube. Your doctor will help you pick the type and the delivery method that’s best for you. Lifestyle Changes Exercise is an important part of treating type 1. But it isn’t as simple as going for a run. Exercise affects your blood sugar levels. So you have to balance your insulin dose and the food you eat with any activity, even simple tasks around the house or yard. Knowledge is power. Check your blood sugar before, during, and after an activity to find out how it affects you. Some things will make your levels go up; others won't. You can lower your insulin or have a snack with carbs to keep it from dropping too low. If your blood sugar is high -- above 240 mg/dL -- test for ketones, the acids that can result from high sugar levels. If they’re OK, you should be good to go. If they’re high, skip the workout . You’ll also need to understand how food affects your blood sugar. Once you know the roles that carbs, fats, and protein play, you can build a healthy eating plan that helps keep your levels where they should be. A diabetes educator or registered dietitian can help you get started. Type 1 Diabetes Complications Type 1 diabetes can lead to other problems, especially if it isn’t well-controlled. Complications include: Cardiovascular disease . Diabetes can put you at higher risk of blood clots , as well as high blood pressure and cholesterol. These can lead to chest pain , heart attack, stroke , or heart failure . Skin problems . People with diabetes are more likely to get bacterial or fungal infections. Diabetes can also cause blisters or rashes . Gum disease . A lack of saliva , too much plaque, and poor blood flow can cause mouth problems. Pregnancy problems . Women with type 1 diabetes have a higher risk of early delivery, birth defects, stillbirth, and preeclampsia . Retinopathy. This eye problem happens in about 80% of adults who have had type 1 diabetes for more than 15 years. It’s rare before puberty , no matter how long you’ve had the disease. To prevent it -- and keep your eyesight -- keep good control of blood sugar, blood pressure , cholesterol , and triglycerides . Kidney damage. About 20% to 30% of people with type 1 diabetes get a condition called nephropathy. The chances go up over time. It’s most likely to show up 15 to 25 years after the onset of diabetes. It can lead to other serious problems like kidney failure and heart disease. Poor blood flow and nerve damage . Damaged nerves and hardened arteries lead to a loss of feeling in and a lack of blood supply to your feet . This raises your chances of injury and makes it harder for open sores and wounds to heal. When that happens, you could lose a limb. Nerve damage can also cause digestive problems like nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea . You can take steps to keep from getting complications. Do your best to keep your blood sugar under control. Monitor your blood pressure and cholesterol. Eat well and exercise. If you smoke, quit. Take care of your feet and teeth. Have regular medical, dental, and vision exams."
