0,Immunizations and Vaccines,"Immunizations, or vaccines as they're also known, safely and effectively use a small amount of a weakened or killed virus or bacteria or bits of lab-made protein that imitate the virus in order to prevent infection by that same virus or bacteria. When you get an immunization , you're injected with a weakened form of (or a fragment of) a disease. This triggers your body's immune response, causing it to either produce antibodies to that particular ailment or induce other processes that enhance immunity. Then, if you're ever again exposed to the actual disease-causing organism, your immune system is prepared to fight the infection. A vaccine will usually prevent the onset of a disease or else reduce its severity. Why Should Someone Get Immunized? The goal of public health is to prevent disease. It's much easier and more cost-effective to prevent a disease than to treat it. That's exactly what immunizations aim to do. Immunizations protect us from serious diseases and also prevent the spread of those diseases to others. Over the years immunizations have thwarted epidemics of once common infectious diseases such as measles , mumps, and whooping cough . And because of immunizations, we've seen the near eradication of others, such as polio and smallpox . Some vaccines need to be given only once; others require updates or ""boosters"" to maintain successful immunization and continued protection against disease. Which Immunizations Do My Children Need? Because proof of immunization is often a prerequisite for enrollment in school or day care , it's important to keep your children up to date on their vaccines. The benefit of doing so is that your children will be protected from diseases that could cause them serious health problems. The recommended immunizations for children 0-6 years of age include: Hepatitis B Rotavirus Diphtheria, tetanus , pertussis Haemophilus influenzae type B Pneumococcal Poliovirus Influenza Measles , mumps , rubella Varicella (chickenpox) Hepatitis A Meningococcal (for certain high-risk groups) COVID-19 At one time or another, each of the diseases addressed by these vaccines posed a serious health threat to children, taking their lives by the thousands; today most of these diseases are at their lowest levels in decades, thanks to immunizations. It's important to keep your child's immunizations on schedule and up to date, but if your child misses a scheduled dose they can ""catch up"" later. The complete updated schedule of immunizations for children ages 0-18 can be downloaded from the CDC website. What About Immunization Side Effects? Today, vaccines are considered safe. As with any medication , they can have side effects. In most cases, these are usually mild. Most common minor reactions to an immunization are: Soreness or redness around the injection site Low-grade fever Side effects like these usually disappear in a few days. In extremely rare instances a high fever , in excess of 104 F, can occur with a vaccine. Fevers like this will not harm your children, but they can make them uncomfortable and upset. Children have also been known to have serious allergic reactions to a vaccine. These usually happen very soon after getting the vaccine, and doctors' offices are well equipped to handle such reactions. If you think your child has or may have an allergy to any component in a vaccine, be sure to share that information with your doctor. Medical providers agree that the proven preventive benefits of vaccines far outweigh the risks of the minimal side effects associated with them. More information about vaccine side effects and precautions can be found in the CDC's brochure Parents Guide to Childhood Immunizations. How Effective Are Immunizations? Vaccines are very effective at preventing disease, but they don't work all the time. Most of the recommended childhood immunizations are 90%-100% effective, according to the CDC. However, for reasons that are not completely understood, sometimes a child will not become fully immunized against a disease after receiving a vaccine. This is all the more reason to get children vaccinated. Children in whom the vaccine is 100% effective protect those few who have not been completely immunized -- lessening everyone's chance of exposure to the disease. Even in cases where a vaccine has not given your child 100% immunity, the symptoms -- if your child is exposed to an infectious disease -- will still usually be milder than if they had not been immunized at all. Vaccine Myths and Misinformation Here are important answers to three common misconceptions about vaccines. Misconception #1: ""We don't need to vaccinate against rare diseases."" Few parents today have even heard of all of the diseases we vaccinate against, let alone seen a case of the measles, diphtheria, or whooping cough. This leads some to ask, ""Why am I giving my child a vaccine against a disease that doesn't even exist?"" The answer is that it's the vaccines that keep these diseases so rare. Avoiding having your child immunized because of myths and misinformation about vaccine safety puts your child -- and public -- at risk. In communities where vaccine rates have dropped, these infectious diseases have quickly returned. Misconception #2: ""The preservative thimerosal makes vaccines risky."" Another concern about vaccines involves the use of a mercury-based preservative called thimerosal. Thimerosal has been used as a preserving agent in some vaccines and other products since the 1930s. According to the CDC, no harmful effects have been reported from the amount of thimerosal used in vaccines, other than expected minor reactions like redness and swelling at the injection site. However, in July 1999, the Public Health Service (PHS) agencies, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), and vaccine manufacturers agreed to reduce or eliminate thimerosal in vaccines as a precautionary measure. It's important to note that since 2001, with the exception of some flu vaccines , no U.S. vaccines used to protect preschool children against infectious disease contain thimerosal as a preservative. A preservative-free version of the inactivated flu vaccine (containing trace amounts of thimerosal) is available. Misconception #3: ""Vaccines cause autism ."" Because symptoms of autism spectrum disorder, a learning disorder, usually occur around the same time as the first measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) and other immunizations in children, some have assumed that there is a link between thimerosal and autism. However, the MMR vaccines have never contained thimerosal, and neither have the vaccines for chickenpox or inactivated polio. In 2004, an Institutes of Medicine report concluded that there is no association between autism and vaccines that contained thimerosal as a preservative. The only study that made any connection between vaccines and autism was found to have been fraudulent and the head researcher has been paid to make the connection. All subsequent studies. including a 2019 study of almost 700-thousand children over a ten year period,  have concluded there was no connection between vaccines and autism. Diseases such as measles, mumps, and rubella can cause serious health problems, disabilities, and even death. Your children face a much greater risk from an infectious disease than they do from its vaccine. Immunizations and Bioterrorism Recent fears of a potential terrorist attack using a biological agent, such as anthrax or smallpox, have led some to wonder if they need to be immunized against these diseases. Currently, the CDC believes that the risks to the general population are low and so hasn't made vaccinations for these diseases available to the public. The CDC, however, recommends immunization against these diseases for certain individuals that may be at high risk for exposure, such as lab workers or members of the military."
1,Can I Have a Vaginal Birth After a C-Section?,"If you’re pregnant again and your last baby arrived via cesarean section , you may wonder if a vaginal birth could be an option for you this time around. A vaginal birth after C-section (VBAC) is possible for many women, but there are factors to help you and your doctor decide if it’s right for you. Safety for you and your baby is the main thing to consider. VBAC isn’t always safe for every woman. If you try to have a vaginal birth and you’re at high risk of complications, it can cause serious problems for you and your baby -- some even life-threatening. That’s why it’s important that you talk to your doctor about the risks. How’s Your Health? For you and your doctor to consider a vaginal birth for you, both you and your baby need to be in good health. You might even be able to attempt VBAC if you’re pregnant with twins if your doctor says that all of you are healthy enough. Your doctor may suggest that VBAC is too risky for you to succeed at vaginal birth. Risks could include any of the following: Obesity (your body mass index is 30 or higher) Pre eclampsia ( high blood pressure during pregnancy) Age (usually older than 35) Your previous cesarean was in the last 19 months The fetus is very large Previous C-section Scar One crucial detail that you and your doctor must discuss is the type of C-section scar that you have on your uterus. (This may be the same type of scar that you have on your abdomen , but it may go in a different direction.) Doctors make incisions (cuts in the abdomen and uterus) in two different directions during a C-section: A vertical cut goes from top to bottom A transverse cut goes from side to side If your C-section scar is vertical, you cannot attempt VBAC. There is a very high risk that your scar could rupture (burst open or tear) when you try to have a vaginal birth, which could cause great harm to you and your baby. You’ll need to have a C-section again. If your C-section scar is low and transverse, your doctor might allow you to try VBAC, if your other risk factors are low. The Hospital Matters Check with your doctor early to find out if the hospital you’re using allows women to attempt VBAC. Not every hospital does. Although the risk of your old scar rupturing during VBAC is low, the hospital must be prepared to handle the emergency that could arise if it does. Some hospitals simply aren’t prepared to handle it. Low Risk vs. No Risk There is a very small chance for every woman who attempts VBAC that their uterus could rupture, even if they have a low transverse C-section scar and is in good health. Doctors can’t be 100% certain whether or not it may happen to you. Even though ruptures happen in less than 1% of VBAC attempts, some women don’t want to try it at all, because if it does occur, it can be very dangerous. You need to weigh your options and talk to your doctor before you decide what to do. Benefits of VBAC If VBAC is an option for you and you like the idea of trying a vaginal birth, there are many reasons you might want to give it a shot. There’s a good chance that you may succeed: About 70% of women who try are able to have their babies via vaginal birth. For the rest, a C-section is needed, due to problems that arise during the attempt. You may want to attempt VBAC for many reasons because if it is successful, it has the following benefits: Doesn’t require surgery Less blood loss Faster recovery Reduced chance of infection You are not likely to suffer injury to your bladder or bowel You will be likely to have fewer problems with future childbirth"
2,Vaginal Cancer,"Vaginal cancer happens when cancerous cells grow in your vagina . A woman’s vagina -- their birth canal -- is a channel that goes from the opening of their uterus to the outside of their body. Many kinds of cancer can spread to the vagina from somewhere else, but cancer that starts here is rare. There are about 6,000 new cases in the U.S. each year. Vaginal Cancer Types There are a few main types of vaginal cancer: Squamous cell carcinoma . This is by far the more common. It happens when cancer forms in the flat, thin cells that line your vagina. This type spreads slowly and tends to stay close to where it starts, but it can move into other places like your liver , lungs , or bones. Older women are most likely to get this form. Nearly half of all new cases are in women ages 60 and up. Adenocarcinoma . This type starts in glandular cells in the lining of your vagina, which make mucus and other fluids. It’s more likely to spread to other areas, including your lungs and the lymph nodes (small organs that filter out harmful things in your body) in your groin. Clear cell carcinoma . This is an even rarer form of adenocarcinoma. It often affects women whose mothers took a hormone called diethylstilbestrol ( DES ) in the early months of pregnancy . Between 1938 and 1971, doctors often prescribed this medication to prevent miscarriage and other problems. Even more rarely, vaginal cancer can form in connective tissue or muscle cells ( sarcoma ) or in cells that make pigments ( melanoma ). Vaginal Cancer Causes and Risk Factors Some cases of vaginal cancer don’t have a clear cause. But most are linked to infection with the human papillomavirus, or HPV . This is the most common sexually transmitted disease (STD). An HPV infection most often goes away on its own, but if it lingers, it can lead to cervical and vaginal cancer. You also might be more likely to get vaginal cancer if you: Are 60 or older Were exposed to DES Drink alcohol Have cervical cancer or precancerous lesions Have HIV Smoke Have unusual cells in your vagina called vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia Vaginal Cancer Symptoms Vaginal cancer often doesn’t cause symptoms. Your doctor might find it during a routine exam or Pap test. If you have symptoms, they can include: Unusual bleeding from your vagina Watery or bad-smelling discharge from your vagina Pain in your pelvis Pain when having sex Pain when peeing Peeing more than usual Constipation A lump in your vagina If you notice any of these things, it doesn’t mean you have vaginal cancer. You could just have an infection. But it’s important to get it checked out. Vaginal Cancer Diagnosis If a pelvic exam or a Pap test shows signs of a problem, your doctor may want to take a closer look by doing a colposcopy . They’ll use a lighted magnifying tool called a colposcope to check your vagina and cervix for anything unusual. They might also take out a bit of tissue so a specialist can look at it under a microscope. This is called a biopsy . Vaginal Cancer Stages After your doctor diagnoses vaginal cancer, they’ll do imaging tests and other exams to find out whether it’s spread to other parts of your body. This helps them decide the stage the cancer and how to treat it. The stages are: Stage I: The cancer is only in your vaginal wall. Stage II: It has spread to the tissue around your vagina. Stage III: Cancer is in the wall of your pelvis. Stage IVa: The cancer has reached the lining of your bladder , the lining of your rectum, or another area of your pelvis. Stage IVb: It has spread to farther parts of your body like your lungs or bones. Vaginal Cancer Treatment You and your doctor will decide on treatment based on many things, including how close the cancer is to other organs, its stage, whether you’ve had radiation treatment in your pelvic area, and whether you’ve had a hysterectomy to remove your uterus. Your doctor will probably recommend one or more of these treatments: Surgery . This is the most common treatment. Your doctor may use a laser to cut out tissue or growths. In some cases, they might remove all or part of your vagina. You may need a hysterectomy to remove your cervix or other organs. Many women can have a normal sex life after surgery. But sex can raise your chances of infection, and it can cause bleeding or strain the surgical site. Your doctor will tell you what’s safe to do and when it's safe. Radiation therapy. This treatment uses high-powered X-rays or other forms of radiation to kill cancer. Your doctor might use a machine that sends X-rays into your body, or they could insert a radioactive substance inside your body, on or near the cancer. Radiation treatments in your pelvic area can damage your ovaries . That can cause them to stop making estrogen , leading to menopause symptoms like hot flashes and vaginal dryness . If you’ve been through menopause, you probably won’t have these problems. This type of therapy also can irritate healthy tissue. Your vagina might get swollen and tender. Sex may be painful. Chemotherapy (“ chemo ”). This uses medication to kill or stop the growth of cancer cells. You might take the medication by mouth or get it injected into a vein ( intravenous or IV). In some cases, your doctor might give you a chemo in lotion or cream form. You may lose your sex drive or have side effects like nausea , hair loss , and changes in body weight . These will improve or go away after treatment. Vaginal Cancer Prognosis Your recovery depends on many things. The most crucial is the stage at which your doctor found your cancer. At the earliest stages, doctors can often cure vaginal cancer. Five-year survival rates are around 67% for women at stages I and II. This means that 5 years after they were diagnosed or treated, 67% of women are still alive. It's about 47% for all stages combined. Your age, your overall health, whether your cancer is new or has come back, and whether it caused symptoms also play a role in recovery. Vaginal Cancer Prevention The best way to protect yourself is to avoid getting HPV. The FDA has approved the Gardasil 9 vaccine to prevent HPV-related diseases, including the seven most common types of HPV that cause cancer. The vaccine is for people ages 9 to 45. Younger patients need fewer shots for full protection. Certain lifestyle changes can also help reduce your risk of vaginal cancer: Wait to have sex until your late teen years or beyond. Don’t have sex with more than one partner. Don’t have sex with someone who has more than one partner. Use condoms during sex. Get regular Pap exams. If you smoke, stop. If you don’t smoke, don’t start."
3,Vaginitis (Vaginal Infection),"What Is Vaginitis? Vaginitis is inflammation of the vagina . It’s due to an imbalance of yeast and bacteria that normally live in the vagina. Along with discomfort, you may notice a smell that's different than usual. You could have an infection caused by bacteria, yeast, or viruses. Chemicals in soaps, sprays, or even clothing that come in contact with this area could be irritating the delicate skin and tissues. It's not always easy to figure out what's going on, though. You'll probably need your doctor's help to sort it out and choose the right treatment. Types and Causes of Vaginitis Doctors refer to the various conditions that cause an infection or inflammation of the vagina as ""vaginitis."" The most common kinds are: Bacterial vaginosis , inflammation of the vagina due to an overgrowth of bacteria. It typically causes a strong fishy odor. Candida or ""yeast"" infection, an overgrowth of the fungus candida, which is normally found in small amounts in the vagina. Chlamydia is the most common sexually transmitted infection (STI) in women, usually in those ages 18 to 35 who have multiple sex partners. Gonorrhea is another common infection spread through sex. It often comes along with chlamydia. Trichomoniasis is an infection spread by sex that’s caused by a parasite . It raises your risk for other STIs. Viral vaginitis is inflammation caused by a virus, like the herpes simplex virus (HSV) or human papillomavirus ( HPV ), which spread through sex. Sores or warts on the genitals can be painful. Symptoms of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) aren’t obvious. If you're sexually active (especially if you have multiple partners), you should talk to your doctor about getting tested for them at your annual checkup. If left untreated, some of these can permanently damage your reproductive organs or cause other health problems. You could also pass them to a partner. Sometimes, itching , burning, and even discharge happen without an infection (noninfectious vaginitis). Most often, it's an allergic reaction to or irritation from products such as: Detergents Douches Fabric softeners Perfumed soaps Spermicides Vaginal sprays It could also be from a lower level of hormones because of menopause or from having your ovaries removed. This can make your vagina dry, a condition called atrophic vaginitis. Sexual intercourse could be painful, and you may notice vaginal itching and burning. Although they may have different symptoms, a diagnosis can be tricky even for an experienced doctor. Part of the problem is that you could have more than one at the same time. You could also have an infection without any symptoms. Yeast infection vs. bacterial vaginosis Two of the most common causes of vaginitis are related to organisms that live in your vagina. They can have very similar symptoms. Yeast infections are an overgrowth of the yeast that you normally have in your body. Bacterial vaginosis happens when the balance of bacteria is thrown off. With both conditions, you may notice a white or grayish discharge. How can you tell them apart? If there's a fishy smell, bacterial vaginosis is a better guess. If your discharge looks like cottage cheese, a yeast infection may be to blame. That's also more likely to cause itching and burning, though bacterial vaginosis might make you itchy, too. It’s possible to have both at the same time. Vaginitis Symptoms A woman's vagina makes a discharge that's usually clear or slightly cloudy. In part, it's how the vagina cleans itself. It doesn't really have a smell or make you itch. How much of it and exactly what it looks and feels like can vary during your menstrual cycle . At one point, you may have only a small amount of a very thin or watery discharge, and at another time of the month, it's thicker and there's more of it. That's all normal. When your discharge has a very noticeable odor, or burns or itches, that's likely a problem. You might feel an irritation any time of the day, but it's most often bothersome at night. Having sex can make some symptoms worse. You should call your doctor when: Your vaginal discharge changes color, is heavier, or smells different. You notice itching, burning, swelling, or soreness around or outside of your vagina. It burns when you pee. Sex is uncomfortable. Vaginitis Treatment The key to treating vaginal infections is getting the right diagnosis. Pay close attention to exactly which symptoms you have and when. Be ready to describe the color, texture, smell, and amount of discharge. Don't douche before your office or clinic visit; it will make accurate testing hard or impossible. Some doctors will ask you to not have sex during the 24 to 48 hours before your appointment. It's better to see your doctor before you try over-the-counter medications , even if you're pretty sure you know what you have. You treat noninfectious vaginitis by dealing with the probable cause. Consider what products you're using that could be irritating your sensitive skin. For hormonal changes, your doctor may prescribe estrogen to ease symptoms. Vaginitis Prevention Keep yourself clean and dry. But doctors don't recommend vaginal sprays or heavily perfumed soaps for this area. Douching may cause irritation, too, and, more importantly, could hide or spread an infection. It also removes the healthy bacteria that do the housekeeping in your vagina. Douching is never recommended. Avoid clothes that hold in heat and moisture. Nylon underwear, tight jeans, gym shorts and leggings that don’t breathe, and pantyhose without a cotton panel can lead to yeast infections. Eating yogurt with active cultures (check the label) might help you get fewer infections. Condoms are the best way to prevent passing infections between sexual partners. Get a complete gynecologic exam every year, including a Pap smear if your doctor recommends it."
4,Vaginal Yeast Infections,"What Are Vaginal Yeast Infections? They’re itchy and uncomfortable, and no one really likes to talk about them. But vaginal yeast infections are very common in women. It’s estimated that 75% of women will have at least one yeast infection in their lifetime. Though yeast infections can happen to anyone at any time, there are certain things that make getting them more likely. Most infections can be cleared up quickly and easily. The vagina normally contains a healthy balance of bacteria and yeast. The hormone estrogen helps bacteria called lactobacilli to grow. These bacteria kill harmful organisms in the vagina and keep you healthy. But when something happens to tip that balance, a fungus called candida can grow out of control and cause a yeast infection. Symptoms of Vaginal Yeast Infections Itchiness and discomfort are the main symptoms of a yeast infection, but there are others. You may also experience any or all of the following: Burning, redness, and swelling of the vagina and the vulva (the outer part of the female genitals) Pain or burning when you pee Pain during sex A thick, white, odorless discharge, similar to cottage cheese If you think you have a yeast infection , see your doctor before treating yourself. The symptoms of yeast infections are similar to other, more serious conditions, including sexually transmitted infections and bacterial vaginosis (bacterial overgrowth in the vagina). An accurate diagnosis is important so you can get the best treatment. Causes of Vaginal Yeast infections There are many reasons you could get a yeast infection, including: Hormones: Changes during pregnancy, breast-feeding or menopause (or if you’re taking birth control pills) can change the balance in your vagina. Diabetes: If your diabetes is not well-controlled, the increase in sugar in the mucus membranes (moist linings) of your vagina can create a place for yeast to grow. Antibiotics: These drugs can kill off many of the good bacteria that live in your vagina. Douches and vaginal sprays: The use of these products can change the balance in your vagina. A weakened immune system: If you are HIV-positive or have another immune system disorder, the yeast may also grow uncontrolled. Sex: Though a yeast infection is not considered a sexually transmitted infection, it can be passed from person to person through sexual contact. Treatments for Vaginal Yeast Infections Over-the-counter antifungal creams, ointments or suppositories (with clotrimazole or miconazole) are the most common ways to treat yeast infections. These can take from 1 to 7 days. Your doctor may also choose to prescribe an oral antifungal medication, such as fluconazole (Diflucan) or ibrexafungerp (Brexafemme). If you’re pregnant, it’s safe to use creams or suppositories but avoid oral medications. It’s important for you to know that some yeast infection medications weaken condoms or diaphragms. That makes it easier for you to get pregnant or contract a sexually transmitted disease. Be sure to read instructions and warnings before using. If you have diabetes or a weakened immune system , you may get yeast infections over and over again. It’s a condition called recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC). If you get yeast infections at least four times a year, your doctor may recommend that you take a weekly fluconazole pill for 6 months to fight them. Oteseconazole (Vivjoa) has been approved for those with recurring problems with infections who will not be reproducing. Can Probiotics Help? Some studies have shown that eating probiotic yogurt or taking Lactobacillus acidophilus supplements may slow the growth of yeast in the vagina, lowering the risk for infections. But more research is needed before a clear connection can be made."
5,Valerian,"For thousands of years, the herb valerian has been used as a sedative in Europe and Asia. Many people throughout the world use it to treat insomnia and anxiety. Why do people take valerian? A number of studies suggest that valerian may help with insomnia . It seems to give people a better quality of sleep. It may also help them fall asleep faster. Scientific evidence is mixed on whether valerian helps with symptoms of anxiety . More research is needed. How much valerian should you take? There is no standard dose of valerian. For insomnia , many studies have used between 400 milligrams and 600 milligrams of valerian up to two hours before bed. Ask your doctor for advice. Can you get valerian naturally from foods? There are no natural food sources of valerian. However, some manufacturers use valerian as a flavoring in foods and drinks. What are the risks of taking valerian? Side effects. Valerian is usually well tolerated when used for a short time. However, it will likely cause sedation. Some people feel a "" hangover "" after taking valerian. It may also cause headaches, upset stomach , uneasiness, irregular heartbeat, or other symptoms, including insomnia. Interactions. Talk to your doctor before you start using valerian supplements . Valerian could interact with some sedatives, narcotics, antidepressants , and anti- seizure medicines. Extreme caution should be used if you combine valerian with any medications that have sedative effects. It may also interact with some dietary supplements such as St. John's wort. Risks. Because valerian may act as a sedative, avoid driving or using machinery after you use it. Taking valerian regularly may cause insomnia . It may also result in withdrawal symptoms after you stop using it. Valerian may strongly interact with alcohol and should not be used at the same time as alcohol. Check with a doctor before taking valerian if you have liver problems. Given the lack of evidence about its safety, valerian is not recommended for children or for women who are pregnant or breastfeeding ."
6,What Is Clubfoot?,"About one out of every 1,000 babies is born with a foot that’s twisted. It may curl sideways with the toes bent at a funny angle. Or, it might have an odd shape and point in the wrong direction, so that it appears to be crooked, or even nearly upside down. Doctors call this clubfoot. Most babies who are born with clubfoot are healthy in all other ways; about half of them have it in both feet. Clubfoot doesn’t cause pain , but if it’s not treated, it can make it hard for a child to walk without a limp. It’s easy to correct in most cases, so most children don’t have long-lasting effects. Can It Be Prevented? Clubfoot happens because the tendons (bands of tissue that connect muscles to bones) and muscles in and around the foot are shorter than they should be. Doctors don’t know what causes it, and there’s no way to ensure that your baby won’t be born with it. But some things make clubfoot more likely. They include: Gender . Two-thirds of babies with clubfoot are male. Family history . Babies with a parent or sibling who had clubfoot are twice as likely to get it. Lifestyle choices . If you smoke or use illegal drugs while you’re pregnant , you raise your baby’s chances of being born with it. Other birth defects . In some cases, it’s linked with another condition a baby is born with, such as spina bifida . Too little amniotic fluid during pregnancy . This surrounds your baby in the womb. If there’s not enough, your baby’s chances of being born with clubfoot are higher. Symptoms It’s easy to notice clubfoot when a baby is born. Here are some signs: The foot points downward, and the toes may be curled inward. The foot appears to be sideways or sometimes even upside-down. The foot may be smaller than a normal foot by up to a half-inch. The calf muscles on the affected leg may not be fully developed. The foot may have a limited range of motion. Most doctors can spot clubfoot simply by looking at your baby when they're born. If you have an ultrasound done late in your pregnancy, your doctor may notice it then. Treatment Your doctor will begin to correct your baby’s clubfoot shortly after they’re born. Babies don’t use their feet until they learn to stand and walk, so the goal is to fix it early enough to prevent delays. Your doctor will use a cast or surgery. Casting. A baby’s tendons bend and stretch very easily, so doctors are able to turn the clubfoot in the right direction to help correct the problem. They gently move the foot into a position that’s closer to where it should be. Then, they put on a cast to hold it in place. About a week later, the doctor removes the cast. They gently stretch the baby’s foot some more, puts it in a new position, and puts on a new cast. They'll continue this pattern for weeks or months. Your doctor may take X-rays to be sure the baby’s bones are slowly moving into their correct positions. If the series of casts helps to correct your baby’s clubfoot, they’ll need to wear a special brace or shoe to keep it at the right angle until after they've learned to walk. This is because a clubfoot tends to turn back to its original position. Some children may only need to wear the brace or shoe for a short time. Others may need it for a few years to make sure the foot stays at the right angle. Surgery. If the tendons and other tissues in your baby’s foot are too short, no amount of stretching and casting can do the trick. If this is the case, surgery may work. Babies who need clubfoot surgery often get it between the ages of 6 months and a year. Unlike the gradual casting process, the doctor fixes everything in one procedure. They may lengthen tendons or take other steps to turn and shape the foot to a more normal position. After surgery, your baby will need to wear a cast to keep their foot at the correct angle. Then, they’ll need a brace or a special shoe for about a year so the foot doesn’t go back to its original position."
7,What Is Peyronie's Disease?,"Peyronie's disease is penis problem caused by scar tissue, called plaque, that forms inside the penis . It can result in a bent, rather than straight, erect penis. Most men with Peyronie's disease can still have sex. But for some, it can be painful and cause erectile dysfunction. Depending on the symptoms,  you may opt for observation, medical or surgical treatments. What Causes Peyronie's Disease? Doctors don’t know exactly why Peyronie's disease happens. Many researchers believe the fibrous plaque can start after trauma (hitting or bending) that causes bleeding inside the penis. You might not notice the injury or trauma. Other cases, which develop over time, may be linked to genes. In some men, injury, and genes could both be involved. Some medications list Peyronie's disease as a possible side effect. But there is no proof that these drugs cause the condition. Who Gets Peyronie's Disease? Although it mostly happens in middle-aged men, younger and older men can get it. It becomes more common as a man gets older. But it’s not a normal part of aging. What Are the Symptoms of Peyronie's Disease? Symptoms may develop slowly or appear overnight. When the penis is soft, you can’t see a problem. But in severe cases, the hardened plaque hampers flexibility, causing pain and forcing the penis to bend or arc when erect. In most cases, the pain eases over time, but the bend in the penis can worsen. Some men with the condition develop scar tissue elsewhere in the body, such as on the hand or foot. Men with Dupuytren's contractures -- scarring in the hand that affects fingers -- seem to be more likely to get Peyronie's. How Do Doctors Diagnose Peyronie's Disease? Tell your doctor about anything, such as an injury, that happened before the symptoms started. You’ll get an exam in which your doctor will feel the hardened tissue caused by the disease during an exam. It’s not always necessary, but if the penis has to be erect for the exam, the doctor would inject a medicine to make that happen. There’s a chance you may need to get an X-ray or ultrasound of the penis. It’s rare, but in some cases where the doctor's exam does not confirm Peyronie's disease, or if the condition develops rapidly, your doctor may do a biopsy . That involves removing a little bit of tissue from the affected area for lab tests. Can Peyronie's Disease Be Treated? Yes, but you might not need it. Since the condition improves without treatment in some men, doctors often suggest waiting 1 to 2 years or longer before they try to correct it. Mild cases of the condition rarely need treatment. Also, the pain that comes from Peyronie's disease happens only with an erection and is usually mild. If it’s not causing a problem with your sex life, treatment may not be necessary. What Treatments Are Available? If you need treatment, your doctor will consider surgery or medicine. First, your doctor will probably prescribe a pill, such as pentoxifylline or potassium para-aminobenzoate ( Potaba ). If those don’t work, you may get a shot of verapamil or collagenase ( Xiaflex ) into the scar tissue of the penis. If nothing else works, your doctor may consider surgery, but usually only for men who can’t have sex because of their Peyronie’s disease. The two most common operations are: Remove the plaque and get a tissue graft in its place. Remove or alter the tissue on the side of the penis opposite the plaque, which counters the disease's bending effect. Unfortunately, these procedures aren’t a sure solution. With the first method, you could have some erection problems. The second method, which doctors call the Nesbit procedure, shortens the erect penis. In some cases, it may be an option to get a penile prosthesis implanted. This treatment is only for men who have both Peyronie's disease and ED (erectile dysfunction). In some cases, extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) may be beneficial in softening a reducing the plaque. Most types of surgery help. But because of the possibility of complications that can’t be corrected, most doctors prefer to operate only on the small number of men with curvature so severe that it prevents sex. Do Vitamins Help? There have been mixed results on studies of vitamin E and with potassium aminobenzoate, which is related to the B vitamins . They aren’t proven cures. Other Options Other ways to treat Peyronie's disease that are unproven include injecting chemicals directly into the plaque and radiation therapy . But because radiation therapy can only relieve pain associated with Peyronie's disease and pain often stops without treatment, it’s rarely done. Pain Management In most men who have penile pain due to Peyronie's disease, the discomfort usually will fade on its own as the penile inflammation subsides. This process may take as long as 6 to 18 months."
8,What Is CMTC?,"Sometimes, a condition has a name that’s much scarier than the problems it causes. That’s usually the case with cutis marmorata telangiectatica congenita , or CMTC. CMTC is a rare disease. It causes a blue or purple pattern on the skin that looks marbled or like fishnet. It generally shows up at birth or shortly after. Most often, it doesn’t need treatment and is just an issue of looks. It gets better as your child gets older. Cutis marmorata telangiectatica congenita, or CMTC is a rare disease that affects some newborn, causing a blue or purple pattern on the skin that looks marbled or like fishnet. It generally appears on the legs but can show up elsewhere on the body but clears ups as your child gets older. CMTC usually doesn’t need treatment and gets better as your child gets older. In rare cases it may affect growth  where it appears The pattern is formed by blood vessels near the skin that are wider than normal, but doctors don’t know what causes it. Once in a while, another family member also has CMTC, but that’s not typical. More often, it happens at random, and it doesn’t seem that anything during pregnancy triggers it. What Are the Symptoms? The main sign is the blue or purple marbled pattern on the skin. It looks a lot like what happens to a baby’s skin when they’re cold, but it’s more defined and doesn’t go away. Most children get it on the legs, but it can happen on the arms, torso, or very rarely, the face and scalp. The pattern may get larger when your child moves, cries, or gets cold. It doesn’t happen often, but CMTC can also cause: Bleeding on areas of the skin where the pattern appears, sometimes along with pain Slower or larger growth of the limb that has the pattern Does It Cause Any Other Problems? This is a much harder question to answer. CMTC is rare and doctors are always learning more about it. It’s not common, but because CMTC may affect growth of the limb where it appears, your child could have one leg or arm that’s longer than the other. Some children with CMTC in their legs also get superficial venous insufficiency -- that’s where the veins in the legs have trouble pushing blood back up to the heart . Beyond those two problems, it’s less clear. In the past, it looked like children with CMTC were also sometimes born with issues ranging from pressure buildup in the eye ( glaucoma ) to muscle loss. But more recent studies seem to show that these children don’t have CMTC. Instead, they have other conditions such as Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome and Cowden's disease. How Will My Doctor Test For It? Your doctor will talk to you about your child’s health history and do a physical exam . That’s typically enough to know if it’s CMTC. If your doctor thinks there’s a different problem, your child may get some imaging, such as an X-ray, CT, or MRI. If CMTC shows on the face or scalp, your child may get an eye exam and a neurological exam, which checks to make sure their brain , nerves, and spinal cord work as normal. How Is It Treated? Often, children with CMTC don’t need treatment and the skin pattern goes away on its own. Usually, the pattern fades the most by the time your child is one, and it will continue to fade as your child’s skin thickens. In many cases, it’s gone within the first few years of life. And once it fades, it doesn’t come back. Even without treatment, you’ll likely have regular visits with your doctor to keep an eye out for any issues. This is especially important since doctors are always learning about CMTC and similar diseases. Your child may need treatment in the following cases: CMTC is on the face or scalp Leg, knee , or hip pain , or other signs that the legs are growing at different rates Pattern bleeds, grows, or causes pain Signs of superficial venous insufficiency Your doctor will recommend a plan to treat these or any other symptoms. For example, if your child has bleeding, you’ll get special bandages for it. If that happens a lot, they may get treated with a device called a pulse dye laser . It destroys the blood vessels that cause problems even after CMTC has faded. It’s very effective, doesn’t harm the skin, and usually doesn’t cause scars. Also, CMTC may create some anxiety for you and your child. The pattern may not fade completely, and that can be hard on an older child if it’s easily seen, especially on the face or neck. Your doctor can help you find a counselor to support your family."
9,What is VRE?,"Everyone has certain bacteria, called enterococci, that live in their intestines and genital tract. They’re also found in the environment. Most of the time they don’t cause any problems, but sometimes they can trigger infections. When they do, they’re treated with a powerful antibiotic called vancomycin . Sometimes, the bacteria become resistant to the antibiotic. That means they can live even though the drug is designed to kill them. These superbugs are called vancomycin-resistant enterococci, or VRE. They’re dangerous because they’re more difficult to treat than regular infections. How Common Is VRE? An estimated 20,000 people in the United States become infected with it each year. A little fewer than 10% of people who get it die from it. People who stay in a hospital have the highest odds of getting VRE. That’s partly because infections that don’t respond to antibiotics spread most easily in places where the drugs are used most often. But you might also have a greater chance of developing a VRE infection if you: Were treated with vancomycin or other antibiotics for long periods of time Recently had surgery, especially of the abdomen or chest Used medical devices that stay in the body for some time, like urinary or IV catheters Have a weakened immune system Were in intensive care units or cancer or transplant wards Already have VRE growing in your intestines or genital tracts. Doctors call this “being colonized” with the bacteria. Symptoms and Diagnosis VRE comes with a number of symptoms. Yours might actually be caused not by VRE, but by other infections it can trigger, like urinary tract infections , bloodstream infections, and wound infections. The time between when you’re infected and when you develop symptoms varies, too. Your doctor will take a sample from the affected area and send it to a lab. If the sample tests positive -- meaning you have VRE -- they’ll do more tests to find out which antibiotic will best treat it. How Can You Stop the Spread of VRE? These superbugs can live on hard surfaces for some time. So wipe down counters, bathrooms, and other areas of your home that are easy resting places for them. Wash your hands with soap and water after using the bathroom and before making food -- especially if you’re in contact with someone who has VRE. A good rule of thumb is to wash up long enough to sing “Happy Birthday to You” twice. Wear gloves if you’re working in close contact with bodily fluids -- like stool or bandages from infected wounds -- that may contain VRE. Always wash your hands after taking off your gloves. If someone in your care has it, let their healthcare providers know so they can take steps to protect themselves, too."
10,Chickenpox (Varicella) Vaccine for Adults,"Chickenpox is a common illness caused by the varicella-zoster virus. Symptoms of chickenpox include fever and itchy spots or blisters all over the body. Chickenpox is usually mild and runs its course in five to 10 days, but it can cause more serious problems when teens and adults get it. People with weakened immune systems are especially susceptible to developing serious complications from chickenpox. Some complications that can arise from chickenpox include: Skin infections Pneumonia Encephalitis (swelling in the brain ) Shingles (later in life) Joint inflammation Vaccination is the best way to prevent chickenpox. A chickenpox vaccine has been available in the U.S. since 1995 and is easy to get from a doctor or a public health clinic. The chickenpox vaccine is very effective at preventing the disease -- between 70% and 90% of people who get vaccinated will be completely immune to chickenpox. If a vaccinated person does get chickenpox, the symptoms will be very mild and only last for a few days. When should adults be vaccinated against chickenpox? All adults who have never had chickenpox or received the vaccination should be vaccinated against it. Two doses of the vaccine should be given at least four weeks apart. If you've never had chickenpox or been vaccinated and you are exposed to chickenpox, being vaccinated right away will greatly reduce your risk of getting sick. Studies have shown that vaccination within three days of exposure is 90% effective at preventing illness; vaccination within five days of exposure is 70% effective. If you do get sick, the symptoms will be milder and shorter in duration. Who shouldn’t get the chickenpox vaccine? You should not be vaccinated against chickenpox if you: Are moderately to severely ill at the time of vaccination Are pregnant (women should not become pregnant for one month after receiving the chickenpox vaccine) Have ever had an allergic reaction to gelatin, the antibiotic neomycin , or a previous dose of chickenpox vaccine Are an organ donor recipient These people should check with their doctor about getting the chickenpox vaccine : Patients undergoing chemotherapy or radiation for cancer People taking steroid drugs or other immunosuppressants People with HIV or another disease that compromises the immune system Patients who recently had a blood transfusion or received other blood products What's in the chickenpox vaccine? The chickenpox vaccine is made from a live, weakened form of the varicella virus. That means the virus is able to produce immunity in the body without causing illness. Are there any risks associated with the chickenpox vaccine? The most common side effect from the chickenpox vaccine is swelling, soreness, or redness at the site of the injection. A small number of people may also develop a mild rash or a low-grade fever after vaccination. Serious reactions to the chickenpox vaccine are extremely rare, but they may include: Seizures Brain infection Pneumonia Loss of balance Severe allergic reaction ( anaphylaxis ) If you think you may be having a serious reaction to the chickenpox vaccine, call your health care provider right away. Make a note of the symptoms you're experiencing, and report them to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) at 1-800-822-7967. Women who receive the chickenpox vaccine during pregnancy should contact their health care provider right away. Chickenpox during pregnancy can cause birth defects, so there may be a risk that the chickenpox vaccine could cause the same birth defects. As with other vaccines, the risks associated with the chickenpox vaccine are much lower than the risks associated with the disease itself."
11,Understanding Varicose Veins: The Basics,"What Are Varicose Veins? Varicose veins are usually bulging, bluish cords running just beneath the surface of your skin . They almost always affect legs and feet. Visible swollen and twisted veins -- sometimes surrounded by patches of flooded capillaries known as spider veins -- are considered superficial varicose veins . Although they can be painful and disfiguring, they are usually harmless. When inflamed, they become tender to the touch and can hinder circulation to the point of causing swollen ankles , itchy skin , and aching in the affected limb. Besides a surface network of veins, your legs have an interior, or deep, venous network. On rare occasions, an interior leg vein becomes varicose. Such deep varicose veins are usually not visible, but they can cause swelling or aching throughout the leg and may be sites where blood clots can form. Varicose veins are a relatively common condition, and for many people they are a family trait. Women are at least twice as likely as men to develop them. In the U.S. alone, they affect about 23% of adult Americans. What Causes Varicose Veins? To help circulate oxygen-rich blood from the lungs to all parts of the body, your arteries have thick layers of muscle or elastic tissue. To push blood back to your heart , your veins rely mainly on surrounding muscles and a network of one-way valves. As blood flows through a vein, the cup-like valves open to allow blood through, then close to prevent backflow. In varicose veins, the valves do not work properly, allowing blood to pool in the vein and making it difficult for the muscles to push the blood ""uphill."" Instead of flowing from one valve to the next, the blood continues to pool in the vein, increasing venous pressure and the likelihood of congestion while causing the vein to bulge and twist. Because superficial veins have less muscle support than deep veins, they are more likely to become varicose. Any condition that puts excessive pressure on the legs or abdomen can lead to varicose veins. The most common pressure inducers are pregnancy, obesity , and standing for long periods. Chronic constipation and -- in rare cases, tumors -- also can cause varicose veins. Being sedentary also may contribute to varicosity because muscles that are out of condition offer poor blood-pumping action. The likelihood of varicosity also increases as veins weaken with age. A previous leg injury may damage the valves in a vein, which can result in a varicosity. Genetics also plays a role, so if other family members have varicose veins, there is a greater chance you will, too. Contrary to popular belief, sitting with crossed legs will not cause varicose veins, although it can aggravate an existing condition. Can You Prevent Varicose Veins? Even though your genetics play a part in your risk for varicose veins, there are things you can do to prevent them. Exercise regularly. Staying fit is the best way to keep your leg muscles toned, your blood flowing, and your weight under control. Maintain a healthy weight. If you are overweight or obese, lose weight. Weight control prevents excess pressure buildup on veins of the legs and feet. Avoid tight clothing. Tight clothes can constrict blood flow in the waste, groin, or legs. Avoid high heel shoes. Wearing high heels for prolonged periods of time can hinder circulation. Flat or low-heel shoes are better for circulation, as they improve calf muscle tone. Move around. Avoid sitting or standing for prolonged periods of time to encourage blood flow. If your daily routine requires you to be on your feet constantly, consider wearing daily support hose. Stretch and exercise your legs as often as possible to increase circulation and reduce pressure buildup. Quit smoking. Studies show that smoking may contribute to the development of varicose veins . If you're pregnant, sleep on your left side rather than your back. This will minimize pressure from the uterus on the veins in your pelvic area. This position will also improve blood flow to the fetus. If you are prone to developing varicose veins , ask your doctor for a prescription for compression stockings ."
12,"Smallpox: Symptoms, Spread, and Treatment","What Is Smallpox? Smallpox is a serious infectious disease caused by a virus that’s no longer found in nature. It was passed from person to person. People with smallpox had flu-like symptoms and a rash that would spread across their bodies. Smallpox was deadly. About 30% of people who got smallpox died. In the 1900s, before smallpox was eradicated in 1980, it killed about 300-500 million people around the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) called smallpox “one of the most devastating diseases known to humanity.” If a smallpox vaccination is successful, a scar will form where you received the shot. (Photo Credit: Moment RF/Getty Images) Smallpox history Historians believe that smallpox has been around for at least 3,000 years. This is based on smallpox-like rashes found on Egyptian mummies from the 18th and 20th Egyptian dynasties. Historians say that the growth of civilization and exploration, as well as expanding trade routes, caused the disease to spread to other countries and continents. People began to notice that those who got smallpox and survived never got it again. They realized that the best way to prevent getting sick was to expose yourself to the virus. This was often done by inhaling or rubbing the material from a smallpox sore onto the skin. Eventually, English doctor Edward Jenner learned that exposing people to the similar but less deadly cowpox virus helped protect them from smallpox. Sometime in the 1800s, the smallpox vaccine was modified to use a poxvirus that was similar to smallpox but less harmful. However, the disease continued to infect people around the world. The last smallpox outbreak in the U.S. happened in 1949. In 1967, WHO launched a plan to wipe out smallpox around the world through widespread immunization and surveillance. As a result, no cases of smallpox have happened since 1977. WHO declared it eradicated in 1980. Today, scientists keep only a small amount of the virus alive under tightly controlled conditions in the U.S. and Russia for medical research. Routine smallpox vaccinations stopped in the U.S. and in many other countries in 1972, and in all other WHO member countries by 1986. Many adults living today likely got the vaccine as children. Smallpox Symptoms Smallpox gets its name from the most common sign of the disease: small skin-colored blisters that pop up on the face, arms, and body, and fill up with pus. Other symptoms include: Flu -like fatigue Headache Body aches Intense back pain Some vomiting High fever Mouth sores and blisters that spread the virus into the throat A skin rash that gets worse Blindness that can happen when blisters form near the eyes Smallpox incubation period Usually, you won’t show symptoms of smallpox for about 10-12 days after you've been exposed to someone infected with the virus. But the incubation period (the number of days it takes for symptoms to appear after you’re infected with the virus) can be as little as 7 days or as long as 17 days. The virus enters the body through the membranes in your mouth, nose, or eyes. After about 3-4 days, it travels to your lymph nodes and into your bloodstream where it multiplies. During this time, you won’t show symptoms. About 8 days after exposure, the virus begins to spread to the small blood vessels of the skin and back to the membranes of the mouth. At this point, you may begin to feel like you’re getting sick but not show symptoms. Early smallpox symptoms The earliest symptoms happen about 12 days after exposure. You may get a high fever, feel extremely weak, vomit, and have body aches. About 2 days after that, the virus begins to spread to the outer layer of your skin. Once you get a fever, you become contagious and can spread the disease to other people. Around 12-14 days after exposure, you’ll develop a flat red rash that begins in the membranes of the mouth and throat and on your face and hands. It then spreads to the rest of the body, usually within 24 hours. The rash develops blisters within a day or two. Once the rash appears, your fever will probably drop, and you’ll begin feeling better. What does smallpox look like? Smallpox blisters usually cover a person’s entire body from head to toe, including the mouth and throat. Here is how the rash changes throughout the illness: The rash starts with flat red sores in the mouth and quickly spreads across the body within about 24 hours. The rash turns into raised bumps filled with clear liquid. The bumps turn into pus-filled blisters a day or two later. The blisters crust over, usually about a week later. Scabs form over the blisters and then fall off over the next 3-4 weeks. They can cause permanent scars. Smallpox vs. chickenpox Smallpox and chickenpox are both caused by viruses. Both cause blisters to form on the skin. But there are distinct differences: Smallpox and chickenpox are caused by different viruses. The variola virus causes smallpox, while the varicella virus causes chickenpox. Chickenpox is usually mild, while smallpox was more serious, killing about 30% of the people it infected. Chickenpox sores usually show up first on the trunk of the body or the face. Sores are rarely seen on the palms or soles of the feet. Smallpox sores usually appear first in the mouth, throat, face, or forearms before spreading over most of the body. Most people with smallpox have sores on their palms or the soles of their feet. Smallpox Causes The variola virus causes smallpox. There are two forms of the virus. The more dangerous form, variola major, led to a form of smallpox that killed about 30% of people who were infected. Variola minor caused a less deadly type that killed about 1% of those who got it. Two forms of smallpox -- hemorrhagic and malignant -- were more deadly than the common strain. Hemorrhagic smallpox tended to affect adults, including pregnant adults, not children. Those infected with this strain had more serious symptoms, including fever, pain , and headaches, and they leaked blood from their blisters and mucous membranes. People usually died of blood poisoning within a week. Malignant smallpox tended to affect children. Instead of raised blisters, infected individuals developed flat lesions that emerged on the skin surface. Most people who got this form of smallpox also died of blood poisoning. How Smallpox Is Spread Smallpox is spread from person to person. But you're only contagious once you develop a fever. After that, you are most contagious in the first 7-10 days. This is because the virus is most numerous in your saliva. Once scabs form on your blisters, you can still spread the disease but you're less contagious. You're considered noncontagious when the last scab falls off. The disease enters your body through the mucous membranes in your mouth, nose, or eyes. You could get it: By breathing in the virus during close, face-to-face contact with an infected person. It usually spreads through drops of saliva when the person coughs , sneezes, or speaks. By handling the clothes or sheets of an infected person or coming into contact with their body fluids. Very rarely, smallpox has spread among people in small, enclosed spaces, probably through air in the ventilation system. Animals and insects don’t spread the disease. If the virus were spread through an act of terrorism. This is a rare possibility, but in case it happens, governments around the world have stockpiled smallpox vaccines to prevent the spread . Smallpox Diagnosis Because smallpox hasn’t been diagnosed in decades, it’s likely that doctors wouldn’t recognize the disease in a patient right away. It’s possible to diagnose the condition by testing a sample of tissue taken from a smallpox blister. A single diagnosis would be considered a worldwide health emergency. Smallpox Treatment In the event a case does emerge, there are two antiviral drugs approved by the U.S. FDA to treat the disease: tecovirimat (TPOXX) and brincidofovir (Tembexa). Both have been shown to stop the growth of the virus that causes smallpox. The drug cidofovir has been shown to stop the growth of the smallpox virus. It’s not FDA-approved to treat smallpox, but it could be used during an outbreak under certain circumstances, such as an Emergency Use Authorization. None of these drugs have been tested in people sick with smallpox. But tecovirimat and cidofovir have been shown to work in animals with diseases similar to smallpox, and it’s believed that brincidofovir would, too. Tecovirimat and cidofovir are stockpiled within the U.S. Strategic National Stockpile, which holds medications and medical supplies to protect the American public in the event of a public health emergency, such as a smallpox outbreak. Getting the vaccine within 3-4 days of contact with the virus may make the disease less severe or may help prevent it. Beyond that, medical care aims to ease symptoms (such as fever and body aches) and control any other illnesses that a person can get when their immune system is weak. Antibiotics can help if someone gets a bacterial infection while they have smallpox. Smallpox Complications If people get hemorrhagic or malignant smallpox, they are more likely to die. The more fatal forms of the disease are more likely to affect those who are pregnant or immunocompromised. People who survive smallpox may have scarring on their face and body. In rare cases, they may become blind. Smallpox can also cause infertility in men and those assigned male at birth (AMAB), and it may cause miscarriage or stillbirths in those who are pregnant. Smallpox Vaccine Scientists use the vaccinia virus, which is the cousin virus to variola, to make the smallpox vaccine, because it poses fewer health risks. The vaccine helps the body's immune system to make antibodies, which recognize and protect against the variola virus and help prevent smallpox disease. Routine smallpox vaccinations stopped in 1972 in countries where cases were no longer reported, including the U.S. Other WHO member countries stopped routine smallpox vaccinations in 1986. No one knows for sure how long the smallpox vaccine protects people from the disease. Some experts believe it lasts up to 5 years and wears off over time. Since it may not give lifelong protection, anyone vaccinated years ago as a child could be at risk of future infection by the variola virus. The only people known to be immune for life are those who have had smallpox and survived. WHO and its member countries keep an emergency stockpile of the smallpox vaccine. It’s rarely used today, except for those few people who are around the variola virus, such as laboratory researchers working with variola or similar viruses. Who invented the smallpox vaccine? English doctor Edward Jenner developed the first successful smallpox in 1796. He had noticed that milkmaids who had gotten sick with cowpox seemed immune to smallpox. He assumed that exposure to the cowpox virus must help protect against smallpox. He tested the theory on the 9-year-old son of his gardener, later exposing the boy to smallpox, but the boy never got sick. Jenner’s smallpox vaccine became commonly widely accepted. At some point in the 1800s, the cowpox virus in the vaccine was replaced with the vaccinia virus. Smallpox vaccine scar Many people (mostly in their 40s or older) who got the smallpox vaccine have a permanent scar on their arm where they got the injection. This scar isn’t from the needle but rather from the body’s immune reaction to defend itself against the controlled infection caused by the live vaccinia virus in the vaccine. Exposure to the virus usually left a sore and itchy bump at the injection site. The bump turned into a larger blister that eventually fell off and left a scar. The formation of a sore bump — and ultimately, a scar — at the injection site lets you know that the immunization process was successful. Smallpox vaccine risks Smallpox vaccine side effects are generally mild, such as: Soreness in the arm that received the injection Itching Swollen lymph nodes Fever Headache Body aches Mild rash Fatigue Some side effects can be dangerous, especially for people with weakened immune systems. They can range from skin reactions to a serious nervous system condition called encephalitis , which can lead to convulsions, coma , and death. But these side effects are very rare. Based on historical data, for every 1 million people vaccinated for smallpox, only one to two people died from a bad reaction. People who would have a higher risk of a reaction to the vaccine include: Those who are pregnant or breastfeeding People with skin disorders such as eczema People with a weak immune system due to a medical condition such as leukemia or HIV People on medical treatments, such as for cancer , that make the immune system weak People who have had a serious allergic reaction to a previous smallpox vaccine Smallpox as a Public Health Threat It’s hard to know how major a threat a smallpox outbreak would be today. Scientists can’t be sure because: The number of people around the world with weakened immune systems is higher today than when smallpox existed. Countries used vaccines of different strengths during the global effort to end smallpox. There’s no way to know for sure how long these different vaccinations give immunity to the virus. If an outbreak of smallpox were to happen today, public health measures would likely include these steps: Finding and vaccinating infected people Vaccinating health care workers and others at risk of infection Isolating smallpox patients to keep them from spreading the disease Providing vaccinations for the public, as needed, to contain the outbreak Takeaways Smallpox was eradicated in 1980, and no cases have happened since 1977. Scientists keep a small amount of the smallpox virus alive under tightly controlled conditions in the U.S. and Russia for medical research. In the event of another smallpox outbreak, governments around the world have smallpox treatments and vaccines stockpiled to protect the public. Smallpox FAQs Does smallpox still exist? Smallpox has been eliminated worldwide. But researchers keep a small amount of the live virus in tightly controlled conditions for research purposes. Is monkeypox the same as smallpox? Mpox is caused by the monkeypox virus, which is part of the same family of viruses as the smallpox virus. The symptoms of mpox are similar to but milder than smallpox and the disease is nowhere near as deadly. Neither mpox nor smallpox are related to chickenpox. Why was smallpox so fatal? Smallpox was so deadly because there were no reliable treatments available. And while the first vaccine was developed in 1796 and was widely accepted, it was not widely administered. Smallpox killed as many as 300-500 million people in the 1900s. Thanks to global immunization efforts, the disease was wiped out by 1980."
13,What Is Gastritis?,"Gastritis is an inflammation , irritation, or erosion of the lining of the stomach . It can occur suddenly (acute) or gradually (chronic). What Causes Gastritis? Gastritis can be caused by irritation due to excessive alcohol use, chronic vomiting , stress, or the use of certain medications such as aspirin or other anti-inflammatory drugs. It may also be caused by any of the following: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) : A bacteria that lives in the mucous lining of the stomach ; without treatment, the infection can lead to ulcers, and in some people, stomach cancer. Bile reflux: A backflow of bile into the stomach from the bile tract (that connects to the liver and gallbladder ) Infections caused by bacteria and viruses If gastritis is left untreated, it can lead to a severe loss of blood and may increase the risk of developing stomach cancer . What Are the Symptoms of Gastritis? Symptoms of gastritis vary among individuals, and in many people there are no symptoms. However, the most common symptoms include: Nausea or recurrent upset stomach Abdominal bloating Abdominal pain Vomiting Indigestion Burning or gnawing feeling in the stomach between meals or at night Hiccups Loss of appetite Vomiting blood or coffee ground-like material Black, tarry stools How Is Gastritis Diagnosed? To diagnose gastritis, your doctor will review your personal and family medical history, perform a thorough physical evaluation, and may recommend any of the following tests: Upper endoscopy . An endoscope , a thin tube containing a tiny camera, is inserted through your mouth and down into your stomach to look at the stomach lining. The doctor will check for inflammation and may perform a biopsy , a procedure in which a tiny sample of tissue is removed and then sent to a laboratory for analysis. Blood tests. The doctor may perform various blood tests, such as checking your red blood cell count to determine whether you have anemia , which means that you do not have enough red blood cells. They can also screen for H. pylori infection and pernicious anemia with blood tests. Fecal occult blood test (stool test) . This test checks for the presence of blood in your stool, a possible sign of gastritis. What Is the Treatment for Gastritis? Treatment for gastritis usually involves: Taking antacids and other drugs (such as proton pump inhibitors or H-2 blockers) to reduce stomach acid Avoiding hot and spicy foods For gastritis caused by H. pylori infection, your doctor will prescribe a regimen of several antibiotics plus an acid blocking drug (used for heartburn) If the gastritis is caused by pernicious anemia , B12 vitamin shots will be given. Eliminating irritating foods from your diet such as lactose from dairy or gluten from wheat Once the underlying problem disappears, the gastritis usually does, too. You should talk to your doctor before stopping any medicine or starting any gastritis treatment on your own. What Is the Prognosis for Gastritis? Most people with gastritis improve quickly once treatment has begun."
14,What Are Central Venous Catheters?,"Often when you need medicine, you just pop a pill in your mouth , down some water, and go about your day. But at other times your doctor may need to give you drugs or fluids that go right into one of your veins. If you only need it for a few days, like when you’re healing from surgery, you’ll likely get a regular intravenous tube (IV). It’s thin and about an inch long. It goes into your arm or hand. But if you need care for longer than that, you might get what’s called a central venous catheter. It’s also called a central line. A CVC is also a thin tube, but it’s much longer than a regular IV. It typically goes into a large vein in your arm or chest. When Would I Need One? The key with CVCs is that they can stay in for weeks or even years, depending on the type. That can make long-term treatment a lot easier. If you get needles or a regular IV over and over, they can damage your veins. Plus, constantly getting stuck with needles can take a toll on you. And, if you get a lot of medicine through an IV, you might feel it burning every time it goes in. A CVC helps you avoid those problems. Your doctor may use it to give you medicine for pain, infection, and other conditions, such as cancer or heart issues. They can also be used for taking samples for tests and to give you fluids, nutrients , and blood . For example, you might get a CVC if you need: A lot of blood tests Chemotherapy for cancer Kidney dialysis Long-term antibiotics to fight infection Self-treatment at home There are different types of CVCs. Which one you get depends on several things: What you need it for How long you’ll have it Where in your body it goes This is something you would talk over in detail with your doctor. Here’s more on three of the types: PICC Line A PICC (peripherally inserted central catheter) line goes into your arm and runs all the way to a large vein near your heart . The other end may have one or two tubes, called lumens, that stick out of your arm just above your elbow . That’s where the medicine goes. When you need a PICC line, first you get some medicine so you won’t feel any pain. Then, your doctor uses a needle to insert the tube. They’ll have ultrasound or fluoroscopy (it’s like a live X-ray) to help guide the tube into place. Your doctor then takes the needle out and puts a bandage, called a dressing, over the area where the PICC went in. This keeps it clean and dry, which helps you avoid infection. You’ll need to flush your PICC line and change the dressing often. A nurse will show you how to do this. Port Also called an implanted port, this is a thin tube with one or two discs on one end. It goes entirely under your skin , discs and all. You usually get it in your chest, just under your collarbone. To give you treatment, your doctor places a needle through your skin and into the disc. To keep you from feeling pain, you can get a cream to rub on and numb the area where the needle goes in. To get a port, you need a short, minor surgery. You’ll be awake for it, but you’ll get drugs to help you relax and prevent pain. Your doctor makes two small cuts, then slides the tube into a vein until it gets right near your heart. Then, they place the disc end of the port into a pocket between the two cuts. Your doctor closes both cuts with stitches or a special glue called Dermabond. When you’re done, you’ll have just a small bump where the disc is. Because it’s totally under your skin, a port doesn’t limit day-to-day activities as much as other CVCs. You can’t play contact sports such as football or hockey, but once you heal from the surgery and get your doctor’s go-ahead, you can swim, bathe, and shower as usual. It can stay in for years, and when not in use, it doesn’t require as much care as a PICC line or tunneled CVC. Tunneled CVC Most times, this one also goes into your chest around your collarbone. One end goes near your heart. On the other end, just like a PICC line, you’ll have one or more lumens where your doctor can insert medicine. When you need a tunneled CVC, you get medicine to help you relax and to make sure you don’t feel any pain. Your doctor makes two small cuts, then they ease the catheter into your vein and guides it toward your heart. The other end goes in the tunnel between the two cuts, and the lumens hang 6 to 10 inches out of your chest. There’s a cuff in the part that sits in the tunnel, which helps hold the catheter in place. Your doctor then uses stitches to close the cuts and puts a dressing over both. You might be a little sore after getting the catheter in, but that will pass within a couple of days. You’ll need to flush it and change the dressing regularly."
15,Vascular Dementia,"Vascular dementia , also known as multi-infarct dementia is the second most common cause of dementia in older people. Because it has a lower profile than Alzheimer's, many people don't suspect vascular dementia when forgetfulness becomes problematic. It's also difficult to diagnose so it's difficult to know exactly how many people suffer from vascular dementia. Current estimates attribute 15% to 20% of dementia cases in older adults to vascular dementia. Determining the root cause can help determine the best action plan. If it's vascular dementia, certain lifestyle changes can help prevent further damage. WebMD takes a look at vascular dementia, its causes, symptoms, and prognosis. What Is Vascular Dementia? Compared to Alzheimer's disease , which happens when the brain 's nerve cells break down, vascular dementia happens when part of the brain doesn't get enough blood carrying the oxygen and nutrients it needs. Though they happen in different ways, it is possible to have both vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease . Discouraging as this sounds, there is ample reason to control the risk factors that contribute to vascular dementia. Allowing the condition to run its course without intervention can make Alzheimer's disease worse. What Causes Vascular Dementia? Vascular dementia occurs when vessels that supply blood to the brain become blocked or narrowed. Strokes take place when the supply of blood carrying oxygen to the brain is suddenly cut off. However, not all people with stroke will develop vascular dementia. Vascular dementia can occur over time as ""silent"" strokes pile up. Quite often, vascular dementia draws attention to itself only when the impact of so many strokes adds up to significant disability. Avoiding and controlling risk factors such as diabetes, high blood pressure, smoking, and high cholesterol can help curb the risk of vascular dementia. Catching the condition early also helps limit the impact and severity of vascular dementia. Early detection requires an awareness of risk factors and, more importantly, efforts to keep them under control. Anyone who suspects vascular dementia should talk with their doctor. Symptoms of Vascular Dementia Symptoms of vascular dementia depend on what part of the brain is affected and to what extent. Like Alzheimer's disease, the symptoms of vascular dementia are often mild for a long time. They may include: Problems with short-term memory Wandering or getting lost in familiar surroundings Laughing or crying at inappropriate times Trouble concentrating, planning, or following through on activities Trouble managing money Inability to follow instructions Loss of bladder or bowel control Hallucinations or delusions Symptoms that suddenly get worse often signal a stroke . Doctors look for symptoms that progress in noticeable stages to diagnose vascular dementia. Alzheimer's, by comparison, progresses at a slow, steady pace. Another clue is impaired coordination or balance. In vascular dementia, problems walking or balancing can happen early. With Alzheimer's, these symptoms usually occur late in the disease. Who Is at Risk for Vascular Dementia? Some risk factors for vascular dementia can be managed; others, like age and gender, cannot. Among all factors, high blood pressure carries the greatest risk; vascular dementia almost never occurs without it. Likewise, a high risk of stroke goes hand in hand with risk for vascular dementia. One-quarter to one-third of strokes are thought to result in some degree of dementia. People who smoke, consume excessive amounts of alcohol, have diabetes , or heart disease also have a higher rate of the condition. Vascular dementia most commonly occurs in people between the ages of 60 and 75. Men seem to be more vulnerable than women, and the condition affects African-Americans more often than other races. People whose age, sex, or race puts them at increased risk of vascular dementia have that much more reason to manage risk factors within their control. Vascular Dementia Treatment Currently, no available treatments can repair the damage of vascular dementia once it's happened. Nonetheless, diagnosis provides important knowledge and the opportunity to prevent further damage. Prevention typically involves bringing high blood pressure under control through exercise, diet, and medication . The same goes for diabetes if it exists. Patients should stop smoking and curb the use of alcohol. Though medical options are limited, behavioral interventions such as cues and reminders can improve the quality of life for everyone involved. Family members and friends can place notes in visible locations around the house with daily plans and instructions for how to use basic items. Stepping up communication, reminding the person with vascular dementia what day it is, where they live, and what is going on in the family, can help keep them connected to the here and now. Prognosis for People With Vascular Dementia If the conditions that cause vascular dementia go untreated, the prognosis is not good. A person with vascular dementia may seem to improve for periods of time until another stroke takes away more brain function, memory, and independence. Eventually, untreated vascular dementia usually ends in death from stroke, heart disease , or infection. Although vascular dementia is a serious condition, catching it early and preventing further damage are the best medicine. People with vascular dementia can work with their doctors and families to detect and manage the condition."
16,"Brain Lesions: Causes, Symptoms, Treatments","When you scrape your elbow , it leaves an area of inflamed skin , or a lesion. But what are lesions in the brain ? And what causes them? How serious are brain lesions and how are they treated? Here is information about this confusing and unsettling health concern. What Are Brain Lesions? A lesion is an area of tissue that has been damaged through injury or disease. So a brain lesion is an area of injury or disease within the brain . While the definition sounds simple, understanding brain lesions can be complicated. That's because there are many types of brain lesions. They can range from small to large, from few to many, from relatively harmless to life threatening. What Causes Brain Lesions? Brain lesions can be caused by injury, infection, exposure to certain chemicals, problems with the immune system, and more. Typically, their cause is unknown. What Are the Symptoms of a Brain Lesion? Symptoms of a brain lesion vary depending on the type, location, and size of the lesion. Symptoms common to several types of brain lesions include the following: Headaches Neck pain or stiffness Nausea , vomiting , and lack of appetite Vision changes or eye pain Changes in mood, personality, behavior, mental ability, and concentration Memory loss or confusion Seizures Fever Difficulty moving What Are the Different Types of Brain Lesions? Although they share a common definition -- injury or damage to tissue within the brain -- brain lesions vary greatly. Here are some common brain lesions. Abscesses: Brain abscesses are areas of infection, including pus and inflamed tissue. They are not common, but they are life threatening. Brain abscesses often occur after an infection, usually in a nearby area, such as an ear, sinus , or dental infection. They can also appear after injury or surgery to the skull. Read more about the causes of abscesses . Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs): An AVM is a type of brain lesion that occurs during early development. Arteries and veins in the brain grow in a tangle and become connected by tube-like structures called fistulae. The arteries are not as strong as normal arteries. The veins are often enlarge because of the constant flow of blood directly from the arteries through the fistulae to the veins. These fragile vessels may rupture, leaking blood into the brain. In addition, the brain tissue may not receive enough blood to function properly. Damage to the brain may cause seizures as the first symptoms of an AVM. Cerebral infarction: Infarction refers to death of tissue. A cerebral infarction, or stroke, is a brain lesion in which a cluster of brain cells die when they don't get enough blood. Recognize the signs and symptoms of a stroke . Cerebral palsy : This type of brain lesion occurs when a baby is still in the mother's womb, or during delivery. Cerebral palsy does not progress over time. The brain lesions affect the child's ability to move, which can also make communication and related skills difficult. However, many children with cerebral palsy have normal intellectual functioning. Read more on the symptoms and types of cerebral palsy. Multiple sclerosis (MS): With this condition, the immune system attacks and damages the nerve linings ( myelin ) in the brain and spinal cord. These lesions make it difficult for messages to be sent and received properly between the brain and the rest of the body. Learn more about the symptoms of MS . Tumors: Tumors are clumps of cells that grow abnormally from normal tissue. Some tumors in the brain are noncancerous, or benign. Others are cancerous. They may start in the brain, or they may spread from elsewhere in the body (metastatic). They may grow quickly or they may remain stable. Get more information on signs and symptoms of a brain tumor . How Are Brain Lesions Diagnosed? The methods used to find and diagnose brain lesions depend on the symptoms. In many cases, CT and MRI imaging studies help pinpoint the location, size, and characteristics of the lesions. Blood and other lab tests may also be done to look for signs of infection. How Are Brain Lesions Treated? Treatment depends on the type of brain lesion. The goals of treatment may be to provide a cure, relieve symptoms, or improve the quality or length of life. Common approaches for treating brain lesions include the following: ""Wait and see;"" if the lesion is not causing problems and is not growing, you may only need periodic checkups. Surgical removal of the lesion, if possible; new surgical techniques may make it possible to remove even hard-to-reach lesions. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy for lesions that are cancerous Medication to fight infections, such as antibiotics or other antimicrobial drugs Medication to calm the immune system or otherwise change the immune system's response Medication or other therapies to relieve symptoms associated with the brain lesion How Can I Find Out More About Brain Lesions? Brain lesions take many forms, so diagnosing and treating them can be complex. That's why it's important to discuss individual questions about brain lesions with your doctor. Together, you can determine the best way to proceed in identifying, treating, and living with brain lesions."
17,Vasculitis: Symptoms and Treatment,"What Is Vasculitis? Vasculitis causes your blood vessels to narrow, which can cut off blood supply to your tissues and organs. (Photo Credit: E+/Getty Images) Vasculitis, also called angiitis or arteritis, is an autoimmune disease that affects your blood vessels, organs, and tissues. Your vessels swell and narrow, which makes it harder for your blood to flow to your tissues and organs. Some vessels could close entirely. When too little blood reaches your organs and tissues, they can become damaged. Vasculitis Symptoms Vasculitis symptoms can show up in many ways, depending on what part of your body is affected. Still, some general symptoms include: Fever Weight loss Loss of appetite Fatigue Headache General aches and pains Symptoms related to specific areas of your body include: Eyes . Your first sign of vasculitis might be red, itchy, or burning eyes. You could also see double and have temporary or permanent blindness in one or both eyes. Skin . You might get rashes, lumps, or open sores if vasculitis affects blood vessels going to your skin. Nerves . If your nerves don't get enough blood, you could feel numbness, tingling, pain, and weakness. Brain . Vasculitis in your brain may cause a stroke. Heart . You could have heart palpitations or even a heart attack if it affects your heart. Kidneys . Inflammation in the vessels that supply blood to your kidneys can lead to kidney failure. Digestive system . You may feel pain after you eat if vasculitis affects your stomach or intestines. You could also see blood in your stool. Ears . Vasculitis can cause your ears to ring. It could also cause dizziness or sudden loss of hearing. You might also get inner ear infections. Hands and feet . Vasculitis can cause numbness or weakness in your hands or feet, along with swollen or hardened palms and soles. Lungs . If vasculitis affects your lungs, you could have shortness of breath or maybe cough up blood. Genitals . Vasculitis in this area can cause ulcers or open sores. Nose . Along with sinus infections and a runny nose, you could also get blisters in your nose. Mouth . Vasculitis can make your lips and tongue swollen and dry, or your mouth and throat swell. Vasculitis Types Vasculitis is the general term for several conditions that cause blood vessel inflammation. Doctors organize vasculitis into types based on the size of the blood vessels involved. All types of vasculitis can affect anyone, but some are more common in certain age groups. Systemic vasculitis is inflammation of your blood vessel walls, which can happen anywhere in your body. Exercise-induced vasculitis is a type of small-vessel vasculitis. It restricts vessels in your lower legs after you do intense exercise like running or hiking, particularly in hot weather. Women over 50 get it most often. Symptoms include rashes on your legs that go away in a few days. Urticarial vasculitis affects your skin's small blood vessels. The inflammation usually causes patches and hives that can itch, burn, and discolor your skin. If it gets more serious, it may damage other organs, too. Leukocytoclastic vasculitis results when waste from immune cells in the walls of your small blood vessels causes inflammation. When the damaged blood vessels become leaky, they cause raised spots on your skin, usually your legs. Most of the time, it affects only your skin. But it can spread to other organs if it's serious. ANCA vasculitis targets a certain type of white blood cell in your body and tells these cells to attack small blood vessels. When the blood vessels are invaded, they become swollen and inflamed. ANCA vasculitis can happen in many parts of your body. The inflammation causes different symptoms, depending on where it is. IGA vasculitis is the most common type of vasculitis in children. It causes inflammation and bleeding of small blood vessels in your skin, joints, intestines, and kidneys. The most common symptom is a raised skin rash, usually on your legs or buttocks, that looks like bruises. But if IGA vasculitis affects other organs, you could have stomach or joint pain, swelling, and kidney inflammation. Cutaneous vasculitis is when you have inflammation and damage to your skin's blood vessels. It's the most common vasculitis doctors see. It shows up as raised patches on your skin. Central nervous system (CNS) vasculitis happens when the blood vessel walls in your brain and spine become inflamed. Many conditions can cause it, though your immune system often plays a role. While it's one of the more serious types of vasculitis, it is treatable. Rheumatoid vasculitis is a complication of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) that happens when the inflammation that causes joint pain and damage also damages your blood vessels. Rheumatoid vasculitis causes your small- and medium-sized blood vessels to become inflamed and narrow. It most often shows up in skin, nerves, fingers, and toes. Other types of vasculitis include giant cell arteritis, polyarteritis nodosa, Takayasu arteritis, Behçet’s disease, and Kawasaki disease. Vasculitis Causes Doctors don’t know exactly what causes many cases of vasculitis. But there are some possible triggers: Autoimmune diseases like RA, lupus, or Sjögren's syndrome Infections, such as hepatitis B and hepatitis C, that set off an unusual immune system reaction that damages your blood vessels Allergic reactions to medications Certain blood cancers, like leukemia and lymphoma Vasculitis Risk Factors While anyone can get vasculitis, some things can raise your chances of having certain types of the condition, including: Your age. Some types are more common in older people, while others, such as Kawasaki disease, most often affect children. A family history of a particular type of vasculitis Cocaine use Smoking Certain medications, such as allopurinol (Zyloprim), hydralazine (Apresoline), minocycline (Dynacin, Minocin, Myrac, Solodyn, Ximino), and propylthiouracil COVID-19, hepatitis A, or hepatitis B infections Also having other immune disorders Your sex. Certain types are more likely to affect people of a particular gender. How common is it? Most types of vasculitis are very rare. Fewer than 50 out of 1 million people get vasculitis every year in the U.S. You're more likely to get it if you're over 50. But your odds are still very low. Only about 300 out of 1 million people older than 50 in the U.S. are diagnosed annually. Vasculitis Diagnosis Your doctor will ask about your medical history and do a physical exam . There's no test just for vasculitis. But because it tends to result from other conditions, you may need tests to look for inflammation and figure out what's causing your symptoms. These tests may include: Blood tests. Certain types of blood cells or antibodies can be signs of vasculitis. Urine tests. These check for kidney damage. Imaging tests . X-rays, MRI scans, CT scans, PET scans, and ultrasounds show inflammation in your blood vessels and organs. You might also have an angiogram, in which your doctor injects dye into your bloodstream. It shows up on X-rays to give a better picture of your blood vessels. Heart tests . An echocardiogram tests how well your heart is working. Biopsy . Your doctor takes a sample of tissue. A specialist can check it for signs of inflammation or damage. Vasculitis Treatment Which vasculitis treatment your doctor recommends depends on what’s causing it and which organs it affects. It's usually meant to control the inflammation and prevent organ and blood vessel damage. Medications Steroids like prednisone are the most common medications prescribed to fight the inflammation vasculitis causes. Your doctor will watch you closely for side effects like high blood pressure, high blood sugar, and bone problems, especially if you take them for a long time. Other medications , like azathioprine (Azasan, Imuran), cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan), methotrexate (Rheumatrex, Trexall), mycophenolate (CellCept, Myfortic), rituximab (Riabni, Rituxan, Ruxience, Truxima), or tocilizumab (Actemra) can be prescribed along with steroids. Which medication you might need depends on how serious your vasculitis is, whether it's in your organs, and your medical history. Surgery Sometimes vasculitis can cause issues that need surgery to repair. For instance, if your blood vessel walls bulge and form an aneurysm, surgery can lower the chances that it will burst. If you have a blocked artery, you could need surgery to restore blood flow to the area. But any kind of organ damage might require surgery. Vasculitis Complications Whether you have complications depends on what type of vasculitis you have and how bad it is. Some serious complications of vasculitis include: Organ damage Blood clots Aneurysm Loss of eyesight Infection Vasculitis Prognosis There's no cure for vasculitis, but with the right treatment, you can live a long and active life. Most types of vasculitis are lifelong. But successful treatment can give you long periods without symptoms (called remissions). Your outlook depends on several things, including: The type of vasculitis you have How quickly you were diagnosed Which organs are affected and how seriously Other health problems you have Living with vasculitis For many people, the hardest part about vasculitis is managing the side effects of medications. There are steps you can take to manage these and other day-to-day issues: Learn and understand the disease . Most types of vasculitis have periods of remission and relapse. Stick to your treatment plan and let your doctor know about any new symptoms or health changes. Exercise regularly . Not only can exercise boost your mood and lower stress, it can help parts of your body that your treatment affects. Regular walking, for instance, can reduce your chances of bone loss, high blood pressure, and diabetes caused by corticosteroids. Adopt healthy food habits . Focus on fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, low-fat dairy products, lean meat, and fish. And limit alcohol, sugar, and fat. A healthful diet can help with medication side effects like thinning bones, high blood pressure, and high blood sugar. If you take corticosteroids, ask your doctors about calcium and vitamin D supplements. Keep your vaccinations updated to help prevent infections, like pneumonia and the flu, that can stem from your medications. Surround yourself with support, whether it's from family, friends, or a support group. Your health care team can also refer you to a mental health professional. Takeaways Vasculitis is inflammation of your blood vessels. It thickens your blood vessels, sometimes so much that blood can't flow properly. This can damage your organs and tissues. It's a lifelong disease without a cure, but it can be treated, usually with steroids. Vasculitis FAQs Is vasculitis very serious? Many types of vasculitis can be serious, specifically when they restrict blood flow. This not only can damage your organs and cause serious issues like aneurysms, but it could also be fatal. Certain kinds of vasculitis can cause vision loss or blindness, if they're not treated. What does vasculitis look like when it starts? If your vasculitis has symptoms you can see on your body, it'll likely appear as a rash, or spots of red, purplish red, black, or simply discolored skin. A vasculitis rash can be on your fingers, legs, ankles, or toes. Other signs that can point to vasculitis are swelling in your joints or cramps and bloating."
18,What Is a Venous Skin Ulcer?,"A venous skin ulcer is a sore on your leg that’s very slow to heal, usually because of weak blood circulation in the limb. They can last anywhere from a few weeks to years. You may hear a doctor or nurse call them “venous leg ulcers.” They can sometimes lead to more serious problems if you don’t have them treated. But there are steps you can take to prevent them from happening. What Causes Them? Venous ulcers happen when there’s a break in the skin on your leg, usually around the ankle . The veins in the leg, which should send blood back to the heart , might not be doing their job all that well. That’s often because the valves that stop the flow of blood back into the veins aren’t working like they should. This backflow of blood means increased pressure in the end of the limb. When that happens, it can weaken the skin and make it harder for a cut or scrape to heal. They often occur over bony areas, such as your ankle. Who Gets Them? About 1% of Americans have venous skin ulcers. They’re more common in older people, particularly women. You also may have a chance of getting one if you: Have previous leg injuries Have varicose veins Smoke Are obese Have had other circulation problems such as blood clots or phlebitis , a painful swelling of the veins Symptoms A venous ulcer often feels itchy or burns , and the leg around it may be swollen. Other signs may include: A rash or dry skin Brownish discoloration A foul-smelling fluid oozing from the sore An ulcer can also become infected. If that happens, you might notice: A redness or swelling of the surrounding skin Worsening pain A fever Pus Diagnosis If you have a wound that isn’t healing or you think is infected, you should see your doctor. Usually, all it takes is a quick examination of the sore and the skin around it to figure out whether you have a venous skin ulcer. Your doctor will ask you if you have a history of ongoing (or “chronic”) conditions, such as diabetes or hardening of the arteries . In some cases, however, your doctor might order other tests, such as an X-ray or a CT scan , to check out your veins and the area around the ulcer in more detail. Sometimes, an ulcer can lead to other problems, including serious skin and bone infections. And in rare cases, it can give rise to skin cancer . Treatment The most common treatment is a compression bandage or stocking. The pressure should improve the blood circulation in your leg, boosting your body’s ability to heal the sore. You’ll probably be told to raise your leg for set lengths of time as well. This also helps circulation. Doctors typically recommend a half-hour at a time, 3 or 4 times a day. If your ulcer is infected by bacteria, you’ll probably be given antibiotics to kill the infection. You might also be given a moist dressing to put over the ulcer to help it heal more quickly. In some cases, your doctor might recommend surgery to improve the circulation in your legs. This can help your ulcer heal and could prevent similar problems later. Most ulcers heal after 3 or 4 months of treatment. However, some can take longer, and some may never clear up. Prevention There are a variety of ways you can prevent venous skin ulcers through lifestyle changes, diet or medication . You might: Quit smoking Lose weight Control chronic conditions such as high blood pressure or diabetes Take aspirin to prevent blood clots Reduce the amount of salt in your diet Exercise regularly Wear compression stockings Keep your legs elevated when you can"
19,Ventricular Septal Defect,"Ventricular Septal Defect Overview Ventricular septal defect is a hole in the wall between the right and left ventricles of the heart . This abnormality usually develops before birth and is found most often in infants. The ventricles are the 2 lower chambers of the heart. The wall between them is called the septum. A hole in the septum is called a septal defect. If the hole is located between the upper chambers or atria, it is called an atrial septal defect. Infants may be born with either or both types of defects. These conditions are commonly known as ""holes in the heart."" Normally, deoxygenated blood from the body returns to the upper chamber of the right side of the heart called the right atrium.  It passes through the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle, which pumps the blood to the lungs to absorb oxygen. After leaving the lungs, the oxygenated blood returns to the left side of the heart, to the left atrium.  It then passes through the mitral valve into the left ventricle, where it is pumped out to provide oxygen to all the tissues of the body. A ventricular septal defect can allow newly oxygenated blood to flow from the left ventricle, where the pressures are higher, to the right ventricle, where the pressures are lower, and mix with deoxygenated blood. The mixed blood in the right ventricle flows back or recirculates into the lungs. This means that the right and left ventricles are working harder, pumping a greater volume of blood than they normally would. Eventually, the left ventricle can work so hard that it starts to fail. It can no longer pump blood as well as it did previously. Blood returning to the left side of the heart may back up into the lungs, causing pulmonary congestion, and blood returning the right side of the heart may further back up into the body, causing weight gain and fluid retention. Overall, this is called congestive heart failure . If the VSD is large and surgically uncorrected, pressure can build excessively in the lungs, called pulmonary hypertension . The higher the lung or pulmonary pressure, the greater the chance of blood flowing from the right ventricle through the VSD to the left ventricle, causing deoxygenated blood to be pumped out to the body by the left ventricle, causing cyanosis (blue skin ). The risk for these problems depends on the size of the hole in the septum and how well the infant ’s lungs function. The ventricular septal defect may not be heard with a stethoscope until several days after birth. This is because a newborn's circulatory system changes during the first week, with a drop in the lung or pulmonary pressure creating the greater pressure differential between the 2 ventricles, which may increase the left-to-right shunt and produce an audible murmur. Ventricular septal defects are the most common congenital heart defects in infants The condition occurs in about 25% of all infants born with a heart defect. These defects are more common in premature infants. Ventricular Septal Defect Causes No one knows what causes ventricular septal defects, but they probably come from a malformation of the heart that occurs while the infant is developing in the womb. There may be just one hole or several holes in the septum. The septum itself is divided into multiple areas, including the membranous part, the muscular part, and other areas called the inlet and outlet. Any or all of these parts can have a hole. The location of the hole depends on where the malformation takes place during fetal development . The most common type of ventricular septal defect is the membranous variant. In this type, the hole is located below the aortic valve, which controls flow of blood from the left ventricle into the main artery of the body, the aorta. Ventricular Septal Defect Symptoms Small holes in the ventricular septum usually produce no symptoms but are often recognized by the child's health care provider when a loud heart murmur along the left side of the lower breast bone or sternum is heard. Large holes typically produce symptoms 1-6 months after an infant’s birth. The left ventricle begins to fail, producing the following symptoms: Fast breathing Sweating Pallor Very fast heartbeatsDecreased feeding Poor weight gain When a ventricular septal defect is not detected early in life, it can cause more severe problems and more severe symptoms as time goes on. The biggest concern is development of high pressure in the lungs (pulmonary hypertension). If the ventricular septal defect is not surgically closed, irreversible pulmonary hypertension can develop, and the child may no longer benefit from surgery. The following are typical symptoms of pulmonary hypertension: Fainting Shortness of breath Chest pain Bluish discoloration of the skin (cyanosis) The skin turns faintly bluish when the tissues are not receiving quite enough oxygen. This condition is often termed ""hypoxemia"" or ""hypoxia."" When to Seek Medical Care Any of the following should be reported to your child's health care provider: Poor weight gain or slowing of weight gain in the first months of life Unusual behavior Any of the other symptoms noted in the previous section An immediate visit to the nearest hospital emergency department is warranted if you notice any of the following in your infant: Shortness of breath, breathing difficulty of any type, or worsening of an existing breathing problem Bluish color of the skin, lips, or under the nails Unusual or unexplained sweating Exams and Tests If a ventricular septal defect is noted before your baby leaves the hospital, several tests may be ordered before discharge. An echocardiogram (an ultrasound picture of the heart), a chest X-ray , and blood tests may be taken. You will be asked to follow up with your child's primary care provider, and you will have to watch closely for signs and symptoms that suggest congestive heart failure or hypoxia. A ventricular septal defect is detected on physical examination by a systolic murmur audible with a stethoscope along the lower left sternal or breast bone border. It is related to the oxygenated blood “swishing” through the hole or VSD into the right ventricle. The presence of a hole in the heart can be confirmed by echocardiogram. This painless test uses ultrasound waves to construct a moving picture of the heart. It can quantitate the size of the left-to-right shunt by enlargement of the left ventricle, pressure in the lungs, and actually estimate the degree of shunting by an empirical formula. Chest X-ray is useful to see if the overall heart size is enlarged, and may demonstrate evidence of fluid in the lungs or pulmonary congestion. An electrocardiogram is helpful to evaluate the sizes of the left and right ventricle.  If right ventricular hypertrophy is indicated, this may suggest pulmonary hypertension. Cardiac catheterization may be performed in certain circumstances. In this procedure, a very thin plastic tube called a catheter is inserted into the skin in the groin, arm, or neck (under local anesthesia with minimal pain) and advanced to the heart under X-ray observation by the cardiologist. Pressures are measured inside the heart, especially if any concern was previously raised over the degree of pulmonary hypertension and therefore operability. If the lung pressures are very high and won’t drop with oxygen and additional vasodilating drugs , the patient may not be operable. If additional abnormalities are possible, a dye study may be performed to visualize the anatomy of inside the heart. But the echocardiogram may accomplish this goal in the majority of patients. Ventricular Septal Defect Treatment In some children with ventricular septal defect, the defect will close on its own as the child grows. Medical Treatment If a larger ventricular septal defect is causing symptoms, your child's health care provider may prescribe medication. Which medication is prescribed depends on the severity of symptoms. The goal of therapy is to reduce the symptoms of congestive heart failure, such as poor growth and development, weight loss and/or poor weight gain, excessive sweating, and fast breathing. An older patient typically develops fluid in the lungs, liver , and legs. Routine antibiotic use is warranted for dental surgery and any invasive procedure if any VSD is still present after closure. Medications Vasodilators: Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers are used to decrease the work load on the left ventricle. Digoxin ( Lanoxin) increases the strength of the heart muscle to deal with the greater blood volume. Diuretics such as Lasix (furosemide) or spironolactone help remove excess fluid from the body so the heart doesn't have to work as hard and the patient feels much better. Surgery Larger ventricular septal defects do not close as the child grows. If it does not close, closing the heart surgically is necessary. Surgical closure is typically done before the child begins preschool. Surgery is indicated if medications do not work in the first few months or years of life, especially if the child is not growing adequately even with medications. Surgery is more urgent if evidence of pulmonary hypertension has developed. The most used operation involves placing a Gore-Tex patch over the hole. This prevents shunting (the movement of oxygenated blood from the left to the right ventricle). Surgery is not usually performed in newborns because small defects will close spontaneously in 20%-25% of cases. The surgery also is more risky in the first few months of life; the risk of death from the operation is higher in the first 6 months of life. Doctors are also using devices that cover the defect, performed in the cardiac catheterization laboratory, not by open heart surgery. Next Steps - Follow-Up Regular office visits and echocardiograms are required to continually reassess the ventricular septal defect. The child's weight and length/height will be checked often. Feeding and activity levels should be assessed routinely. Routine antibiotic use is warranted for dental surgery and any invasive procedure. Prevention Women can do nothing during pregnancy to prevent their babies from developing a ventricular septal defect. Outlook During the growth of a child, the defect may become smaller and close on its own. Twenty to 25% of all ventricular septal defects close by age 3 without medical intervention. Children who show no symptoms and are being monitored by a primary care provider do not have to restrict their activities. Children with mild-to-moderate shunting of blood may have to reduce their levels of activity. Once a defect is repaired, there are no restrictions on activity. Several other conditions may result from ventricular septal defects. Aortic regurgitation: Blood flowing backward from the aorta into the left ventricle. Endocarditis: An infection of the heart valves due to abnormal blood flow. Because endocarditis is always possible, medical professionals may recommend that children with certain types of ventricular septal defects receive antibiotics before undergoing dental procedures or surgery. Pulmonary hypertension: An increase in pressure in the right side of the heart and in the arteries of the lungs. This is caused by the shunting of blood from the left to the right ventricle, which increases the pressure in the right ventricle.

20,Ventricular Tachycardia,"What Is Ventricular Tachycardia? Ventricular tachycardia is a type of arrhythmia, or irregular heart rhythm. Sometimes called VT or V-tach, it’s an unusually fast heartbeat that starts in the lower part of your heart called the ventricles. What is a normal heartbeat? Your heart is a muscular pump with four chambers. The two upper ones are called the atria. The two lower ones are called the ventricles. They work together to pump blood throughout your body. Every day, a healthy heart beats about 100,000 times. Most regular heart rates are in the range of 60 to 100 beats a minute. Your heartbeat follows a pattern that is controlled by electrical signals. They start in the sinoatrial (SA) node. It’s in one of your atria and is often called your heart’s natural pacemaker. The signal causes your atria to contract so blood moves into your ventricles. It then moves down to another part of your heart called the atrioventricular (AV) node. This tells your ventricles to contract and move the blood along. What happens in ventricular tachycardia? When you have VT, abnormal electrical signals from your ventricles take over and make your heart beat quickly. The pulses coming from your SA node are also affected. Ventricular tachycardia can result in rates of 120 to 170 beats a minute or even more. When this happens, your heart’s upper chambers don’t have time to refill and send that blood to the ventricles. So your blood doesn’t get pumped throughout your body the way it should. Ventricular tachycardia vs. ventricular fibrillation In some instances, ventricular tachycardia can lead to ventricular fibrillation. Sometimes called V-fib or VF, this condition also causes a fast heart rate. But with VF, the heart muscle shakes instead of following a regular pattern. If left untreated, V-fib can prevent blood flow to the rest of your body. Your heart may stop within a few minutes. Ventricular tachycardia (VT) is a type of arrhythmia, or irregular heart rhythm. It’s an unusually fast heartbeat that starts in the lower part of your heart (the ventricles). Monomorphic VT describes when your heart rhythm looks more steady from beat to beat when your doctor checks the electrical activity with an electrocardiogram (EKG). Polymorphic VT is a very dangerous type of arrhythmia, when your heart’s electrical activity changes from beat to beat. (Photo credit: iStock/Getty Images) Types of Ventricular Tachycardia Here are some common terms used to describe ventricular tachycardia: Monomorphic ventricular tachycardia Monomorphic ventricular tachycardia describes how your heart rhythm looks more steady from beat to beat when your doctor checks the electrical activity with an electrocardiogram (EKG). “Mono” means each heartbeat “wave” looks the same on the machine. Around 70% of all VT episodes are this kind. Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia This type of VT is a very dangerous type of arrhythmia. The “poly” part means your heart’s electrical activity is all over the place. You may need a different type of medication or treatment depending on the type of polymorphic VT you have. Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia refers to when VT lasts less than 30 seconds. These episodes may come and go, which can make it harder to diagnose at the doctor’s office. Sustained ventricular tachycardia Sustained VT is when you have a VT episode for 30 seconds or longer or it causes a problem, like a sudden drop in blood pressure, that needs treatment. Pulseless ventricular tachycardia This type of VT means your ventricles beat so fast they can’t fill with blood to send to the rest of your body. You won’t have a pulse if your heart can’t sustain normal blood flow. This can happen whether you have monomorphic VT or polymorphic VT. Ventricular Tachycardia Symptoms You may not notice any symptoms, especially if your heart beats fast for only a few seconds, but ventricular tachycardia can cause: Feeling lightheaded or dizzy Chest pain Heart pounding or fluttering (palpitations ) Shortness of breath or trouble breathing Anxiety Fainting Tightness in your neck A feeling of tightness or squeezing in your chest Tiredness Ventricular tachycardia may cause a sudden drop in blood pressure, which means your tissue and organs can’t get enough oxygen. You might pass out when this happens, but your heart may stop. This is called sudden cardiac arrest, and can be fatal. When should I call a doctor? Get in touch with your medical provider if you have an increase or change in your regular heart rate and don't know why. Call 911 or go to the hospital right away if you or a loved one have emergency signs or symptoms of ventricular tachycardia, especially: Chest pain Trouble breathing Loss of consciousness Fast or abnormal heartbeat that lasts longer than 30 seconds Loss of pulse See your doctor as soon as possible if you’ve felt lightheaded or dizzy, had rapid heartbeats, or have fainted. Call 911 if you have chest pain and trouble breathing along with a very fast pulse. Ventricular Tachycardia Causes Ventricular tachycardia happens when there’s a glitch in your heart’s electrical system. These abnormal signals trigger the fast rhythm in your ventricles that revs up your heart rate. You’re more likely to have ventricular tachycardia if you’re older or if heart rhythm problems run in your family. That includes conditions you can inherit from your parents like long QT syndrome or Brugada syndrome. Conditions that can cause problems with the signals in your heart that lead to ventricular tachycardia or raise your chances of it also include: Prior heart attack Heart failure Weak heart muscle (cardiomyopathy) Conditions that scar your heart (sarcoidosis) Blood flow issues from heart disease Electrolyte imbalance, especially abnormal levels of potassium and magnesium Inflammation of your heart muscle ( myocarditis ) Sarcoidosis, a condition that causes inflamed tissues to grow in your body Conditions that change the pH in your cells (acidosis) Stimulants like cocaine or methamphetamine Heavy alcohol use or caffeine Recreational drugs Certain medications When doctors can’t find a cause, it’s called idiopathic ventricular tachycardia . Ventricular Tachycardia Diagnosis Your doctor will review your medical history and ask about your symptoms. They’ll also run some tests on your heart, which usually includes an electrocardiogram ( EKG or ECG). An EKG records your heart’s electrical activity. Other tests used to diagnose ventricular tachycardia include: Holter monitor. This is a portable device you wear outside of the doctor’s office. It can check your heart’s electrical activity off and on throughout the day. Your doctor might suggest this if they think you have ventricular tachycardia but your EKG is normal. Event monitor. This is another portable EKG you use outside of the doctor’s office. Your doctor may have you wear one for up to 30 days or until you have an irregular heart rhythm. Implantable loop recorder. Your doctor may put a small device under your skin. This can monitor your heartbeat on a regular basis for up to 3 years. Imaging tests (X-ray, MRI, CT, echocardiogram). These tests take a closer look at your heart to show how well it works or if you have structural problems. Coronary angiogram. This can check for blocked arteries that may cause blood flow problems. Stress test. Your doctor may give you medicine or have you exercise (ride a bike, walk on a treadmill) to see if physical activity affects your heart’s electrical activity. Tilt table test. If you faint a lot, your doctor may have you lie on a special table. They’ll move you from flat to upright to see how your heart and blood pressure react to certain situations (like when you go from sitting to standing). Electrophysiological test. Your doctor may thread small wires and sensors through a big blood vessel into your heart. This can pinpoint problem areas that cause your irregular heartbeat. Transesophageal echocardiography. This can check the size and shape of your heart and look for other problems, including certain blood flow issues. Blood tests. These can check for other health problems that may affect your heart, including an electrolyte imbalance or problem with your thyroid hormone. Ventricular Tachycardia Treatment You may not need to do anything if you don’t have symptoms or if episodes last less than 30 seconds. Otherwise, your treatment will depend on what’s causing the problem. For example, if medication or stimulants like caffeine are causing episodes of ventricular tachycardia, you’ll probably have to stop using them. What are the treatments for ventricular tachycardia? Depending on serious your symptoms are, you may need : Cardioversion . Your doctor uses an electric shock to return your heart to its regular rhythm. This is a common emergency treatment, especially if VT happens along with fainting or low blood pressure . Medications to control your heart rate. This includes antiarrhythmic medications such as amiodarone (Nexterone, Pacerone ), flecainide ( Tambocor ), lidocaine (Lidopen), propafenone (Rhythmol SR), or sotalol ( Betapace , Sotylize). Your doctor may also give you drugs called beta-blockers that block chemicals that speed up your heart. These don’t work as well as cardioversion, and they can have side effects. Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). Your doctor implants a small pacemaker near your collarbone that regulates the electrical signals in your ventricles.. An implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). This is a small device placed under the skin just below your collarbone. You may get it along with CRT. An ICD delivers a shock to reset your heartbeat if it becomes uneven. It’s the most effective way to prevent life-threatening problems (like sudden cardiac death) from ventricular tachycardia. Cardiac ablation . This is also called catheter or radiofrequency ablation. Doctors use heat to destroy unusual heart tissue. This method treats the ventricular tachycardia and can cure it. Maze procedure. Your doctor may give you a type of surgery where they make small cuts in the top part of your heart. This creates a pattern (or maze) of scar tissue that abnormal electrical signals can’t get through. Open-heart surgery. In some cases, your doctor may be able to get rid of or fix whatever is causing your fast heartbeat. This is usually only recommended if nothing else helps or you have another type of heart problem that needs treatment. All medical procedures come with risks. But surgeries for ventricular tachycardia, such as cardiac ablation, may cause complications, including: Heart and blood vessel damage Blood clots Increased bleeding Exposure to germs during surgery that cause infection If you have cardiac ablation, you’ll probably need to stay in the hospital overnight. You may be able to get back to normal life within a few days, but ask your doctor how long you’ll need to take it easy. If a medication or caffeine is causing the VT, you might need to stop taking it. Ventricular Tachycardia Management Your treatment plan depends on what’s causing your irregular heart rhythm. But here are some steps you can take to manage ventricular tachycardia: Take any medication your doctor gives you to regulate your heart rate. Get an ICD if your doctor thinks you need one. Work with your medical team to create a safe exercise plan. Keep track of your symptoms and tell your doctor if you notice any changes. Get treatment for any other health conditions. Follow a heart-healthy diet (low in saturated fat, salt and added sugar). Don’t smoke. Complications of Ventricular Tachycardia It’s important to seek treatment if you have an irregular fast heartbeat. While ventricular tachycardia may not always be dangerous, it can cause serious problems if it happens often or for longer than 30 seconds. Your odds of complications also go up if you have other heart problems. If your heart can’t get blood flow to the rest of your body, you may: Faint a lot Lose consciousness Have sudden drops in blood pressure Develop heart failure Get ventricular fibrillation Go into sudden cardiac arrest, which can be fatal Ventricular Tachycardia Prevention You may not be able to completely prevent ventricular tachycardia, but there are steps you can take to lessen your chances of it happening. You’ll want to focus on heart-healthy habits including: Eat mostly fruits, vegetables, whole grains, unsaturated fats, and lean proteins. Limit foods high in sugar, salt, and saturated fat. Aim for 30 minutes of cardio most days of the week. Try yoga. Lose excess body weight if you’re overweight or have obesity. You’ll also want to: Be careful with stimulants like caffeine . Find ways to manage stress. Try to get 7 to 9 hours of sleep a night. Drink alcohol in moderation or not at all. Quit smoking or don’t start. Avoid recreational drugs such as cocaine or methamphetamines. And make sure you talk to your doctor about: How to maintain the right balance of electrolytes like potassium and magnesium Ways to control your blood pressure and cholesterol levels If you need to manage thyroid disorders or kidney disease Which prescription or over-the-counter medications are safe Any heart conditions that need treatment There may be other ways to lessen your chances of triggering an irregular heart rhythm. Ask your medical team for more tips. Takeaways Ventricular tachycardia is a type of arrhythmia that causes your heart to beat faster than normal. Episodes that last longer than 30 seconds can be deadly. Treatment with medication, devices, or surgery can restore your regular heartbeat or prevent VT from happening again. Ventricular Tachycardia FAQs What is the best treatment for ventricular tachycardia? It depends on what’s causing it and how long it’s lasted. In an emergency, you may need an electric shock to the heart. If there’s a good chance you’ll have VT again, the best way to prevent fatal problems is with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). How serious is ventricular tachycardia? It can be harmless if it only lasts a few seconds. But V-tach can be life-threatening if you have an episode longer than 30 seconds and it leads to ventricular fibrillation, which prevents your heart from pumping blood to the rest of your body. What to do if a patient is in V-tach? Go to the emergency room if you or a loved one have ventricular fibrillation for longer than 30 seconds. You’ll need treatment right away with medication or a device that sends electrical shocks to your heart. The goal is to quickly restore your regular heart rate. Is ventricular tachycardia worse than AFib? Both can be serious, but you’re more likely to die from an episode of ventricular tachycardia than atrial fibrillation. But people who have Afib may be more likely to develop VT later on. Ask your doctor if that could happen to you."
21,Seborrheic Dermatitis,"What Is Seborrheic Dermatitis? Seborrheic dermatitis is a common skin disease that causes an itchy rash with flaky scales. It causes redness on light skin and light patches on darker skin. It’s also called dandruff, cradle cap, seborrhea, seborrheic eczema, and seborrheic psoriasis. Seborrheic dermatitis is a skin disease that can cause a rash anywhere on your body. (Photo credit: istock/Getty Images) It might look similar to psoriasis, eczema, or an allergic reaction. It usually happens on your scalp, but you can get it anywhere on your body. Seborrheic dermatitis vs. dandruff Seborrheic dermatitis and dandruff both cause scales that be itchy and either dry or greasy. Dandruff may be considered the mildest form of seborrheic dermatitis. Both conditions can be treated the same way, but your doctor may suggest additional treatments if you have seborrheic dermatitis. Unlike seborrheic dermatitis, dandruff happens only on your scalp. Another difference is that seborrheic dermatitis causes swelling and discolored skin, but dandruff doesn't. Scalp psoriasis vs. scalp seborrheic dermatitis Both are common conditions that can affect your scalp . They share some symptoms, such as inflamed, scaly skin. Scalp psoriasis has patches of thicker and drier scales, while scalp seborrheic dermatitis has skin flakes. Your doctor can tell which condition you have by looking at your skin, scalp, and nails. Treatments for both include medicated shampoos and corticosteroid lotions. Scalp psoriasis, which is more persistent and difficult to treat than seborrheic dermatitis, may also require other treatments like light therapy. Seborrheic Dermatitis Causes Seborrheic dermatitis may be due to the yeast Malassezia, excess oil in your skin, or issues with your immune system. It doesn't come from an allergy or from being unclean. It's not contagious. But e xperts don't know what exactly causes it. Some seborrheic dermatitis triggers include: Stress Fatigue Change of seasons, or weather that's cold and dry Certain medical conditions and medicines Seborrheic Dermatitis Risk Factors Newborns and adults ages 30 to 60 are most likely to get seborrheic dermatitis. It's more common in men than women and in people with oily skin. These conditions can also raise your risk: Acne Alcoholism Having a mental health condition such as d epression Immune system disorders such as HIV infection Being an organ transplant recipient Recovery from a stressful medical condition like a heart attack or stroke Nervous system conditions such as Parkinson's disease Seborrheic Dermatitis Symptoms Your symptoms may include: Flaking skin Flakes of skin in your mustache or beard Patches of greasy skin covered with flaky white or yellow scales or crust A rash that may look darker or lighter in people with brown or Black skin -- and redder in those with white skin Ring-shaped (annular) rash (this is called petaloid seborrheic dermatitis) Itchiness (pruritus) Seborrheic dermatitis can look like other skin conditions. See your doctor to get a diagnosis and a treatment plan. Locations of seborrheic dermatitis Babies 3 months and younger often get cradle cap: crusty yellow or brown scales on their scalp. It usually goes away before they're a year old, although it can come back when they reach puberty . Parents might mistake seborrheic dermatitis for diaper rash. As an adult, you can get seborrheic dermatitis on your face, especially around your nose, in your eyebrows, on your eyelids, or behind your ears . You might develop it on your skin under your beard or mustache. It can show up on other parts of your body, too: In the middle part of your chest Around your navel On your buttocks In skin folds under your arms and on your legs In your groin Below your breasts Seborrheic Dermatitis Diagnosis Your doctor will ask about your medical history and look at your skin. They might scrape off a bit of skin and look at it under a microscope to rule out conditions that affect your skin, including: Psoriasis . This causes a lot of silvery white scales, often on your elbows and knees. It can also change how your fingernails look. You might have this at the same time as seborrheic dermatitis. Eczema (atopic dermatitis). This usually causes inflamed skin on your head, elbows, or knees. Rosacea. This can also happen along with dermatitis. It causes a red rash with few or no scales, often on your face. Rosacea can go away and come back several times. Allergic reaction. If your rash is itchy and doesn’t clear up with treatment, an allergy could be causing it. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Some stages of this condition can cause a butterfly-shaped rash across the middle of your face. Seborrheic Dermatitis Treatment Seborrheic dermatitis will sometimes clear up by itself. But often, it's a lifelong issue that clears and flares. You can usually control it with good skin care. Talk with your doctor about a treatment plan. They’ll probably tell you to start with over-the-counter medicines and home remedies. If you have seborrheic dermatitis on your scalp, use an over-the-counter dandruff shampoo with one of these ingredients: Coal tar Ketoconazole Salicylic acid Selenium sulfide Zinc pyrithione If your baby has cradle cap, shampoo their scalp daily with warm water and baby shampoo. A dandruff shampoo could irritate their skin, so talk to your pediatrician about medicated shampoos before you try one. To soften thick patches, rub mineral oil onto the area and brush gently with a baby hairbrush to help peel the scales off. If you have seborrheic dermatitis on your face and body, keep the affected areas clean. Wash with soap and water every day. Sunlight may stop the growth of the yeast organisms that are causing the problem, so being outdoors could help make the rash go away. Make sure to wear sunscreen. Other treatments include: Antifungal products Corticosteroid lotions Sulfur products These medicines can have side effects, especially if you use them for a long time. Seborrheic dermatitis shampoo. Your doctor might suggest you use a medicated shampoo with 2% ketoconazole or 1% ciclopirox (Loprox). But be aware that ketoconazole can make your hair more dry if it's tightly coiled or chemically treated. In that case, use the shampoo no more than once a week and use a moisturizing conditioner. You can use other medicated shampoos once a day, or two to three times a week, for several weeks. Let it sit on your scalp for a few minutes before rinsing. When your symptoms go away, you can use it every week or two to help prevent a relapse. Whatever treatments you use, follow your doctor’s advice. The best results often come from a mix of treatments . Contact your doctor if your affected areas: Don't get better Become painful, red, or swollen Start draining pus Can seborrheic dermatitis heal on its own? For babies, seborrheic dermatitis (cradle cap) goes away on its own within a few months . For teens and adults,  it might go away on its own, but you'll likely need treatment. It's possible to have flares of seborrheic dermatitis throughout your life. Seborrheic Dermatitis Complications Complications from seborrheic dermatitis are very rare. In some cases, you might develop secondary bacterial infections in areas of your body affected by this skin disease. These include eyelids in adults and diaper areas in babies. You might have some hair loss, but that's caused by itching and rubbing your scalp and other areas affected by seborrheic dermatitis, not by the condition itself. Intense itching can damage your hair follicles , which can interrupt your natural hair growth and cause your hair to fall out. Seborrheic Dermatitis Home Remedies Lifestyle changes and home remedies may help you control seborrheic dermatitis. Your best treatment depends on your skin type, grooming practices, and symptoms. But before using dietary supplements or other alternative therapies, talk with your doctor. Some home remedies you might try are: Use oil to remove scales. Use mineral oil, peanut oil, or olive oil on your scalp for 1 to 3 hours. Then comb or brush your hair and wash it. Wash your skin. Use warm, not hot, water and a gentle soap or non-soap cleanser. Rinse thoroughly. Pat dry and apply a moisturizer while your skin is still damp. Avoid hair-styling products. Don't use hair sprays, gels, or other styling products. Avoid skin and hair products with alcohol . These can make your condition worse. Clean your eyelids. If your eyelids are scaly, wash them daily. Mix a few drops of baby shampoo with two capfuls of warm water. Wipe away scales with a cotton swab. Warm, damp cloths pressed to your eyelids also may help. Use aloe. Apply aloe gel to your affected area. You can choose a skin product that contains aloe or use aloe directly from the leaf of an aloe plant.

22,Why Am I Dizzy?,"What Is Dizziness? Dizziness is a feeling of being lightheaded, unsteady, and faint. It can make you feel like the world is spinning. Sometimes the feeling is mild and goes away quickly. Other times it can be severe and come along with other symptoms, like a headache and throwing up. Dizziness Causes Many parts of your body – including your eyes , brain , inner ear , and nerves in your feet and spine – work together to keep you balanced. When a part of that system is off, you can feel dizzy. Many things can cause dizziness, such as: Inner ear problems, like vertigo Inner ear infections Being low in certain nutrients Heart problems Concussion Diseases that affect your brain Dehydration Stress and anxiety Some medications Motion sickness Low blood sugar When you're dizzy, you might feel like the world is spinning, even though you're standing still. (Photo Credit: Vicu9) Vertigo If it feels like the room is spinning around you and you have trouble staying steady on your feet, you might have a type of dizziness called vertigo . Vertigo can be a symptom of several health conditions affecting your inner ear and your vestibular system. The vestibular system is what helps you sense your body's position in space, coordinate your movements, and stay upright and balanced. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a common inner ear disorder. With BPPV, tiny bits of calcium in part of your inner ear get loose and move to places they don't belong. The system doesn't work the way it should and sends your brain the wrong signals. It's often caused by the natural breakdown of cells that happens with age. A head injury can cause it, too. You'll feel it briefly when you tilt or turn your head, and especially when you roll over in bed or sit up. BPPV isn't serious and usually goes away on its own. If not – or you'd like to help it along – it can be treated with special head exercises to get the pieces of calcium back in place. Your doctor can help you perform these exercises. Meniere's disease People with Meniere's disease have too much fluid in their inner ear. This condition brings on intense periods of vertigo that can last hours. You may feel fullness or pressure in one ear. Other symptoms include ringing in your ears, hearing loss , and nausea. You may feel exhausted after the attack passes. Doctors don't know what causes it, and there's no cure for it. It's usually treated with diet changes (a low-salt diet) and medicine to control the dizziness. Inner ear infection Inflammation of the nerves in your ears due to infection also causes vertigo. Vestibular neuritis and labyrinthitis are two types of infections that can cause problems in the inner ear. Vestibular neuritis affects your vestibular nerve, and labyrinthitis affects both your vestibular nerve and your cochlear nerve – a nerve in your ear involved in hearing. These infections are often caused by a virus. Other causes of vertigo Some other causes of vertigo include: A noncancerous tumor that puts pressure on the vestibular nerve called an acoustic neuroma Some medications that hurt the inner ear, such as aminoglycoside antibiotics, diuretics, or salicylates Head injury Stroke Multiple sclerosis Vestibular migraine Heart Problems and Dizziness Dizziness can sometimes be a sign of a heart problem. It could be an early sign of heart disease or a more serious sign of a heart attack. If your arteries are blocked because of atherosclerosis , for example, your blood flow slows down and doesn’t circulate through your body as it should. Your heart tries to pump harder and faster to help. This might make you feel a racing heart and dizziness, as well as other symptoms. Heart palpitations and dizziness Heart palpitations – the feeling that your heart is beating faster than normal or fluttering – is fairly common. But if you feel your heart fluttering and dizziness together, this could be a sign of problems with your heart. You should see your doctor as soon as possible if this happens. Low Blood Pressure and Dizziness Dizziness can be a sign of low blood pressure, or hypotension . Your brain needs a steady supply of oxygen-rich blood to function properly. Your heart provides this by pumping the blood throughout your body. This pumping action causes pressure as it pushes the blood through the arteries. This is similar to when you turn on a garden hose. As the water fills the hose, it puts pressure on the hose itself. If the water pressure is too low, the water can’t reach as far. If your blood pressure drops too low, the blood doesn’t circulate and can’t reach your brain. This can cause dizziness and fainting, especially if you move suddenly from a sitting to a standing position. Other heart- and circulation-related problems can cause dizziness, such as: Heart attack Sudden severe blood loss Standing up quickly, particularly for older people Blood clots Clogged arteries Irregular heartbeat Other Common Causes of Dizziness Dizziness is quite common and has a wide range of other causes. Dehydration Many people don't drink enough fluids to replace the liquid they lose every day when they sweat, breathe , and pee. When you're very dehydrated, your blood pressure can drop, your brain may not get enough oxygen, and you'll feel dizzy. Other symptoms of dehydration include thirstiness, tiredness, and dark urine . To help avoid dehydration , drink plenty of water and other unsweetened beverages, and limit coffee , tea , and soda, which can increase dehydration. Medications Several drugs list dizziness as a possible side effect. Check with your doctor if you take: Antibiotics, including gentamicin and streptomycin Antidepressants Anti-seizure medications Blood pressure medicine Sedatives Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) People with diabetes need to check the amount of sugar (glucose) in their blood often. You can get dizzy if it drops too low. That also can cause hunger, shakiness, sweating , and confusion. Some people without diabetes also have trouble with low blood sugar. Motion sickness If you get motion sickness , either from riding in a car, being on a boat, or even going on a carnival ride, you may get dizzy as well as sick to your stomach. Concussions (traumatic brain injuries) If you’ve had a strong impact to your head, you are at risk of a concussion – a traumatic brain injury (TBI). A blow to the head could be caused by many things, such as a fall down stairs, certain sports (especially sports like football), or even if your head and neck are shaken badly, like in a car accident. One of the signs of a concussion is dizziness. You could also have: Headache Nausea and vomiting Ringing in your ears Blurry vision Drowsiness Confusion Concussions should be taken seriously. If you think you might have one, seek emergency care as soon as possible. Anxiety and stress If you are anxious, you could feel several physical symptoms, including dizziness. Doctors don’t know why this happens, but they think that somehow the areas in the brain responsible for anxiety and dizziness interact with each other, and that interaction results in dizziness. Carbon monoxide poisoning Carbon monoxide poisoning is very serious. Every year, more than 100,000 people in the U.S. need emergency treatment for carbon monoxide poisoning, and at least 420 die. One of the most common symptoms is dizziness, along with: Headache Weakness Nausea and vomiting Chest pain Confusion If you have any of these symptoms, leave where you are right away and call 911. Low iron levels Iron is an essential mineral that helps your blood carry oxygen throughout your body. Low iron levels, called iron deficiency anemia , can cause dizziness, as well as: Fatigue Feeling that your hands and feet are cold Weakness Shortness of breath A hard time concentrating Bruising easily Headaches There are many reasons you could be low in iron, including: Internal bleeding, like in your gastrointestinal (GI) tract or urinary tract Losing blood after a serious injury or during surgery Having heavy menstrual periods Blood loss after childbirth or miscarriage Giving blood donations too frequently Certain diseases, like inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis) Weight loss surgery Kidney disease Dizziness Symptoms Feeling dizzy can be very uncomfortable. Symptoms include feeling like: Everything around you is moving or spinning and you’re not. You’re lightheaded and going to faint. You can’t keep your balance. You're a little confused or foggy. You're nauseated. How to Stop Feeling Dizzy Occasional dizziness often goes away on its own. In general, if you feel dizzy, try lying down for a few minutes. Sit up very slowly, without sudden movements. Then slowly stand up. This may help. Here are some more tips and home remedies for dizziness, depending on what caused it: Dehydration. If you are overheated or dehydrated, drink fluids, move to a cool or shaded spot, and rest. Water is good, but you may want to try a sports drink, which has electrolytes and minerals the can speed hydration. Medications. Check your drugs for side effects to see if they could be causing your dizziness. Speak with your doctor or pharmacist about your dizziness. If it’s caused by an over-the-counter medication, the pharmacist may be able to suggest another type. If it’s a prescription medication, there may be tips on when and how to take the drug to lower the risk of dizziness. If not, then speak with your doctor to see if there is another medication that can replace it. Low blood sugar. A quick fix is to eat or drink something with sugar, like juice or a hard candy. But if you have diabetes, speak with your doctor about the best way to handle low blood sugar. Motion sickness. It’s not always possible to avoid motion sickness. If you do get motion sickness, you can: Sit in the front seat of a car or as close to the front as possible in a bus. Look out at the horizon. Choose window seats when possible. Lie down if you’re on a boat. Close your eyes. Sip water to stay hydrated. Eat small portions of food frequently. Don't smoke. Suck on ginger candy or other types of lozenges. If your dizziness is caused by something more serious, like a concussion, illness, or an injury, you need to see a doctor. You may need treatment for what is causing it, like antibiotics for an ear infection. Takeaways It’s not unusual to feel dizzy once in a while, especially if it’s caused by motion sickness or being out in the sun for too long. But if you have frequent episodes, the dizziness doesn’t go away, or it’s interfering with your daily activities, speak to your doctor so you can find out what is causing it. If you are dizzy after hitting your head, no matter how lightly, or you have any of these symptoms along with the dizziness, get emergency medical care. Do not drive yourself to the hospital, though, because the dizziness could cause you to have an accident. A hard time breathing Chest pain Irregular heartbeat Numbness or weakness of your arms, legs, or face A hard time walking A hard time speaking or slurred speech Double vision Severe headache Confusion Seizures A hard time hearing Continuous vomiting Dizziness FAQs When should you worry about dizziness? If you get dizzy once in a while and it goes away, you probably don’t need to worry. But if you get dizzy a lot and if the dizziness lasts for long periods, it could be caused by a more serious problem, like an ear infection or medication side effect. Dizziness after a head injury is an emergency, so seek help right away if this happens. What are the causes of dizziness? There are many possible causes of dizziness, from simple things like spinning too much on a carnival ride to motion sickness. But there are some serious causes as well, such as a head injury, blood loss, or having low blood sugar levels. What are the red flags for dizziness? You should be concerned about being dizzy if it happens after a head injury, it happens often, lasts long, or you have other symptoms as well. These include having a sudden, severe headache, confusion, double vision, or numbness or weakness in your arms, legs, or face, among others. How do I stop feeling dizzy? Try lying down for a few minutes and closing your eyes. Then sit up slowly, taking your time. Finally, stand up slowly – don’t make sudden or quick movements."
23,Is Video Game Addiction Real?,"It’s great to do things you enjoy. But can you go too far with a hobby? And at what point does it become an addiction ? That’s the question experts are trying to answer about playing video games. Even though gaming has been around for almost 50 years, studies about its harms are still in the early stages. Different groups have come to different conclusions about whether problem playing should be called an addiction. The World Health Organization added “gaming disorder” to the 2018 version of its medical reference book, International Classification of Diseases . But the American Psychiatry Association’s manual, the DSM-5, didn’t. (So far, gambling is the only “activity” listed as a possible addiction.) Signs to Watch For The DSM-5 does include a section to help people and doctors know the warning signs of problem video gaming. These problems can happen whether you play online or offline. Here’s what to look for in yourself or someone close to you -- your partner, a child, or a friend. You need to have five or more of these signs in 1 year to have a problem, according to criteria that were proposed in the DSM-5: Thinking about gaming all or a lot of the time Feeling bad when you can’t play Needing to spend more and more time playing to feel good Not being able to quit or even play less Not wanting to do other things that you used to like Having problems at work, school, or home because of your gaming Playing despite these problems Lying to people close to you about how much time you spend playing Using gaming to ease bad moods and feelings Of course, not everyone who plays a lot has a problem with gaming. Some experts say that it’s harmful to label people who might just be very enthusiastic about gaming. One thing they do agree on is that the percentage of players who meet the proposed criteria for addiction to video games is small. It’s estimated to be somewhere between 1% and 9% of all gamers, adults and kids alike. (It’s more common in boys and men than girls and women.) It may help to start by asking yourself a few questions: Does your video gaming get in the way of other important things in your life, like your relationships , your job, or going to school? Do you feel like you’ve crossed the line between loving to playing and having to play? Might you be using gaming to avoid a deeper problem, like depression ? It can be hard to see a problem in yourself. The amount of time you spend gaming might seem fine to you. But if people close to you say it’s too much, it might be time to think about cutting back. If you’re a parent who’s concerned about the amount of time your child spends gaming, look at how well they are doing at school and with friends. Having good grades and a good relationship with parents are signs that a child’s video gaming is unlikely to be a problem. Getting Help Get help from your doctor or therapist -- or your child’s pediatrician, if the person you’re concerned about is your son or daughter -- as soon as you think that gaming time is getting out of hand . Studies about treating video game addiction are also in the early stages. One therapy that can help is called CBT or cognitive behavioral therapy . This is mental health counseling that teaches you how to replace thoughts about gaming to help change behavior. If you’re the parent of a gamer, a therapist can show you how to place limits on your child’s playing time if you have a hard time saying no. One study found that making parents part of a child’s treatment makes it work better. Preventing a Gaming Problem To keep the amount of time spent gaming under control, try these tips for adults and kids alike: Set time limits for play and stick to them. Keep phones and other gadgets out of the bedroom so you won’t play into the night. Do other activities every day, including exercise . This will lower the health risks of sitting and playing for long stretches of time. No one knows whether certain kinds of games are more likely to lead to problem gaming. For the time being, make sure that your child is only playing games rated for their age."
24,"Gastroenteritis (""Stomach Flu"")","When you have diarrhea and vomiting , you may say you have the ""stomach flu."" These symptoms often are due to a condition called gastroenteritis . With gastroenteritis, your stomach and intestines are irritated and inflamed. The cause is typically a viral or bacterial infection . Symptoms of Gastroenteritis With gastroenteritis, the main symptoms you probably have are watery diarrhea and vomiting . You might also have stomach pain , cramping, fever, nausea, and a headache . Because of diarrhea and vomiting, you also can become dehydrated. Watch for signs of dehydration , such as dry skin and a dry mouth , feeling lightheaded, and being really thirsty. Call your doctor if you have any of these symptoms. Stomach Flu and Children Children can get dehydrated quickly, so if your child has the stomach flu, it's important that you look for signs that they are very thirsty or has dry skin or a dry mouth . If you have a baby, look for fewer, drier diapers. Keep children with gastroenteritis out of day care or school until all symptoms are gone. Check with your doctor before giving your child any medicine. Drugs used to control diarrhea and vomiting aren't usually given to children younger than 5. To help prevent rotavirus -- the most common cause of stomach flu for children -- there are two vaccines that can be given to infants. Talk to your doctor about the vaccines . What Causes Gastroenteritis? There are many ways gastroenteritis can be spread: Contact with someone who has the virus Contaminated food or water Unwashed hands after going to the bathroom or changing a diaper The most common cause of gastroenteritis is a virus. The main types are rotavirus and norovirus . Rotavirus is the world's most common cause of diarrhea in infants and young children. Norovirus is the most common cause of serious gastroenteritis and also foodborne disease outbreaks in the U.S. Although not as common, bacteria such as E. coli and salmonella can also trigger the stomach flu. Salmonella and campylobacter bacteria are the most common bacterial causes of gastroenteritis in the U.S. and are usually spread by undercooked poultry, eggs, or poultry juices. Salmonella can also be spread through pet reptiles or live poultry. Another bacteria, shigella, is often passed around in day care centers. It typically is spread from person to person, and common sources of infection are contaminated food and drinking water. Parasites can also cause gastroenteritis, but it's not common. You can pick up organisms such as giardia and cryptosporidium in contaminated swimming pools or by drinking contaminated water. There are also other unusual ways to get gastroenteritis: Heavy metals (arsenic, cadmium, lead, or mercury) in drinking water Eating a lot of acidic foods, like citrus fruit and tomatoes Toxins that might be found in certain seafood Medications such as antibiotics , antacids, laxatives , and chemotherapy drugs Gastroenteritis Treatment Prevent dehydration: Give a child an oral rehydration solution. Call your doctor for age-appropriate dosing specifics. Give an adult as much clear fluid as possible. The person should drink fluids slowly in frequent, small amounts. Drinking too much too fast can make nausea worse. As symptoms start to ease: Gradually ease food back into the person's diet. Start with bland, easy-to-digest food such as crackers, bananas, toast, rice, and chicken. Avoid dairy, caffeine , and alcohol until recovery is complete. When to call a doctor Call 911 if the person is in shock from severe dehydration (faints, can't walk, is confused, or is having trouble breathing) Seek medical help if: Vomiting in an adult or a child age 2 or older lasts more than 1 day or a fever or severe diarrhea (large amounts of loose stool every 1 to 2 hours) lasts more than 2 days. A child under age 2 has vomiting or diarrhea for more than 12 hours or has a fever with vomiting and diarrhea. Vomit or diarrhea turns bloody or tarry. The person has kidney , liver , or heart disease and must restrict fluid intake. The person develops sudden, severe abdominal pain. There are symptoms of dehydration. Symptoms don’t go away after a week. Dehydration with these symptoms should be treated in an emergency room: Little to no urination Extreme thirst Lack of tears Dry mouth Sunken eyes Dizziness or lightheadedness Rapid breathing and heartbeat Lack of alertness Blurred or double vision Trouble swallowing or breathing Muscle weakness"
25,Meningitis,"What Is Meningitis? Meningitis is a rare infection that affects the delicate membranes -- called meninges -- that cover the brain and spinal cord. You or your children can catch it. Meningitis vs. encephalitis These two conditions are similar, and many symptoms overlap. While meningitis affects the covering of the brain and spinal cord, encephalitis affects the tissue of the brain itself. Types of Meningitis Bacterial meningitis This is an extremely serious illness. You or your child will need to get medical help right away. It can be life-threatening or lead to brain damage unless you get quick treatment. Several kinds of bacteria can cause bacterial meningitis. The most common ones in the U.S. are: Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) Neisseria meningitidis (meningococcus) Listeria monocytogenes (in older people, pregnant women, or those with immune system problems) A bacteria called Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) was a common cause of meningitis in babies and young children until the Hib vaccine became available for infants. There are also vaccines for Neisseria meningitidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Experts recommend that all children get them, as well as all adults who are at a higher risk for the disease. In many cases, bacterial meningitis starts when bacteria get into your bloodstream from your sinuses , ears , or throat. The bacteria travel through your bloodstream to your brain. The bacteria that cause meningitis can spread when people who are infected cough or sneeze . If you or your child has been around someone who has bacterial meningitis, ask your doctor what steps you should take to avoid catching it. Viral meningitis Viral meningitis is more common than the bacterial form and generally less serious, but this isn't always the case. Several viruses can trigger the disease. Among them are: Non-polio enteroviruses, including the one that causes hand, foot, and mouth disease Herpes simplex virus Varicella zoster, which also causes chickenpox and shingles Mumps virus Measles virus Arboviruses such as West Nile and Zika Epstein-Barr, which also causes mononucleosis HIV Flu viruses Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus Fungal meningitis Fungal meningitis is much less common than the bacterial or viral forms. Healthy people rarely get it. You’re more likely to get this form of meningitis if you have a problem with your immune system, such as AIDS . Among the fungi that cause it are: Cryptococcus , which is common everywhere in the world. Histoplasma, which is especially common in soil with lots of bird or bat poop. In the U.S., it's found mostly in eastern and central states. Blastomyces, which thrives in wet soil and decaying leaves. In the U.S., it's found mostly in midwestern, south-central, and southeastern states. Coccidioides, which is found in the soil in the southwestern U.S., Mexico, Central and South America, and some parts of Washington state. Parasitic meningitis Parasitic meningitis is also rare. It’s caused by parasites that usually affect animals. You can get it from eating animals such as snails, slugs, snakes, fish , or poultry that are infected by parasites or their eggs, or produce that contains parasite eggs. The risk is higher with raw or undercooked foods. You can’t pass on this type of meningitis to other people. One especially rare type of this is called eosinophilic meningitis, and it's linked to three specific parasites: Angiostrongylus cantonensis , also known as rat lungworm, is found in Southeast Asia, Pacific islands, the Caribbean, and Africa. Baylisascaris procyonis is a type of roundworm that affects raccoons. It can also infect other small animals, including dogs. Gnathostoma spinigerum is a parasitic worm found mostly in Asia, South and Central America, and some parts of Africa. Amoebic meningitis Amoebic meningitis is a rare but usually fatal infection by a single-celled bug called Naegleria fowleri . This amoeba lives in soil or warm, fresh water, but not salt water. People typically get it from swimming in water where the amoeba lives, not by drinking it. Amoebic meningitis isn’t contagious. Noninfectious meningitis Noninfectious meningitis is caused by diseases such as lupus or cancer , or it may happen if you’ve had a head injury , brain surgery, or take certain medications . It isn’t contagious. Chronic meningitis Chronic meningitis has similar symptoms as acute meningitis but develops over a couple of weeks. It results from infections with a fungus or the mycobacteria that cause tuberculosis . These organisms get into the tissue and fluid surrounding your brain to cause meningitis. Aseptic meningitis is a term doctors use when they can't find signs of bacteria in fluid from your brain and spine. That might mean your meningitis has another cause, such as a virus, or it might mean the bacteria making you sick is hard to grow in lab conditions. Meningitis Symptoms Meningitis can cause a rash that starts small and looks like pinpricks before spreading into red or purple splotches. It can be hard to spot if your skin tone is darker – check the palms of your hands and the soles of your feet. (Photo Credit: John Radcliffe Hospital/Science Source) Meningitis symptoms can develop within hours or days. The condition may look different in adults than it does in babies or children. Signs to watch for include: Confusion Fever Headache Numbness in your face Sensitivity to light Stiff neck so that you can’t lower your chin to your chest Upset stomach or vomiting Severe headache with nausea or vomiting A hard time concentrating Seizures Sleepiness or a hard time waking up Lack of appetite Lack of thirst What's the first sign of meningitis? In the early stages of meningitis, you might feel like you have the flu. Meningitis in babies In infants, meningitis symptoms may include: High fever Crying that’s constant and gets louder when you hold the baby Baby seems overly sleepy, sluggish, or inactive Stiff neck or body Bulge on the soft area on the top of the baby ’s head Poor ability to feed Crankiness Meningitis in children The symptoms of meningitis in children older than 2 are the same as they are in adults. Meningitis rash Meningococcal bacteria is the main cause of the signature meningitis rash. As the bacteria spread through your body, they damage blood vessels. The vessels start to leak blood, which pools into surrounding tissue and becomes visible on your skin. It may start as what's called a ""petechial"" rash, which looks like small, red pinpricks on your skin. You may find them in spots where clothes put pressure on the skin – the waistband, for instance. A ""purpuric"" rash looks like splotches of red or purple, more like bruising. A petechial rash can progress to this stage. It can be tough to spot the rash on darker skin. Check paler areas of the body, such as the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, tummy, roof of the mouth, and insides of eyelids. If you roll a clear drinking glass over the rash, it might disappear. If it does, it's a ""blanching"" rash. If it doesn't go away, it's a ""non-blanching"" rash. A meningitis rash may start as blanching but almost always will progress to non-blanching. You can have meningitis without developing the rash. But the rash is a sign of serious illness, and anyone with it needs immediate medical help. Risk Factors for Meningitis Anyone can get meningitis, but research shows that it's more common in these age groups: Children under 5 Teenagers and young adults aged 16-25 Adults older than 55 Meningitis is more of a danger for people with certain medical conditions, such as a damaged or missing spleen , long-term disease, or immune system disorders . Because certain germs that cause meningitis can spread easily, outbreaks are most likely to happen in places where people live close to each other. College students in dorms or military recruits in barracks can be more likely to catch the disease. So are people who travel to areas where meningitis is more common, such as parts of Africa. Meningitis and Pregnancy One type of germ that causes bacterial meningitis is listeria. If you're pregnant, you're 13 times more susceptible than the general population to infection by this bacteria. It can contaminate: Hot dogs Lunch meat Paté and other meat spreads Smoked seafood Unwashed raw fruits and vegetables Unpasteurized milk Unpasteurized soft cheeses, including f eta, queso blanco, queso fresco, Brie, queso panela, Camembert, and blue-veined cheeses A listeria infection can lead to meningitis. During pregnancy, it can cause early labor or may be fatal to your baby. That's why doctors recommend avoiding foods most often affected by listeria when you're pregnant. Meningitis Causes Meningitis almost always results from a bacterial or viral infection that begins somewhere else in your body, such as your ears , sinuses , or throat. Less common causes of meningitis include: Autoimmune disorders Cancer medications Syphilis Tuberculosis Is meningitis contagious? Meningitis isn't contagious. But some of the things that cause it are. Many things that cause bacterial and viral meningitis can be spread to other people. Meningitis Diagnosis Your doctor will ask about your medical history and do a physical exam , including checking your neck for stiffness and looking for a skin rash that might suggest a bacterial infection. Meningitis tests If your doctor suspects meningitis, you'll need tests to confirm the diagnosis. They might include: Blood tests to find bacteria CT or MRI scans of your head to find swelling or inflammation Spinal tap, in which a health care worker uses a needle to take fluid from around your spinal cord. It can tell what’s causing your meningitis. Treatment for Meningitis Your treatment will depend on the type of meningitis you have. Bacterial meningitis needs treatment with antibiotics right away. The doctor might give you a general or broad-spectrum antibiotic even before they’ve found the exact bacteria that caused your illness. Once they do, they’ll change to a drug that targets the specific bacteria they find with the spinal tap. You might also get corticosteroids to ease inflammation . Viral meningitis usually goes away on its own without treatment. Your doctor might tell you to stay in bed, drink plenty of fluids, and take over-the-counter pain medicines if you have a fever or aches. If a virus such as herpes or influenza caused your illness, you might take antiviral medication. Antifungal medications can treat fungal meningitis. You might need to spend time in the hospital if you're dehydrated or have severe symptoms. Complications of Meningitis Meningitis can cause severe complications in adults and children, especially if you delay treatment. Possible complications include: Seizures Brain damage or stroke Loss of hearing Memory problems Learning problems A hard time walking, or paralysis Kidney failure Shock Death Prevention of Meningitis You may be able to prevent meningitis by avoiding infection with the viruses or bacteria that cause it. These infections are passed to others when you cough, sneeze , kiss, or share toothbrushes , or eating utensils. Take these steps to prevent infections: Wash your hands often. Rinse well. Also, teach your kids to wash their hands often, especially after eating, using the toilet, or when they’re in public places. Don’t share items such as toothbrushes, eating utensils, or lipstick. Don’t share food items or drinks with other people. Cover your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze. Stay healthy. Eat a healthy diet , get plenty of exercise, and rest at night. If you’re pregnant, eat well-cooked food. Avoid foods made from unpasteurized milk and raw or undercooked meats, fish, and eggs. Get immunized. Follow your doctor’s advice on getting immunization shots for diseases that may cause meningitis, including flu and pneumonia vaccines. Meningitis Vaccines Some vaccines can help protect you from meningococcal illness, which is caused by bacteria. MenACWY vaccine, which the CDC recommends for all teens and preteens. One dose is given at the age of 11 or 12, followed by a booster at age 16. It's also recommended for adults at high risk. MenB vaccine is recommended for children 10 and older who are at increased risk MenABCWY vaccine is a combination of MenACWY and MenB. If you're planning to get the other two at the same time, you can get this vaccine instead. The pneumococcal and Hib vaccines protect against bacteria that can cause bacterial meningitis. The Bacille Calmette-Guerin vaccine protects you against tuberculosis, which can cause meningitis. But it isn't used much in the U.S. Takeaways When you have meningitis, the protective layers around your brain and spinal cord (meninges) become inflamed. Most cases are caused by viruses, but other causes include bacteria, fungi, parasites, or amoeba. Common symptoms include a stiff neck, headache, fever, nausea, and vomiting. If you think you might have meningitis, get immediate medical help. If you have bacterial meningitis, your symptoms could get worse rapidly. Meningitis FAQs Can you have meningitis without a fever? Fever is a common symptom, but not everyone with meningitis has a fever. Can a person survive meningitis? Most people survive most forms of meningitis. How well you do depends on the type you have and how quickly you receive treatment. Amoebic meningitis cases caused by Naegleria fowleri are often fatal, but these infections are also very rare. How long does meningitis last? If you have viral meningitis, your main symptoms may go away within a week. If you have bacterial or fungal meningitis, you may need more time to recover, weeks or even months. You also might have lingering effects."
26,What Is a 'Virtual' Colonoscopy?,"This test helps your doctor see inside your rectum and colon (also called your large intestine). You might hear them call it CT colonography, or computed tomography, a kind of test that takes pictures of your insides. It’s most often used to look for small growths called polyps and to check for colon or rectal (colorectal) cancer . How Is It Different From a Full Colonoscopy? During a full colonoscopy, your doctor slides a thin, flexible tube into your rectum so they can see your colon. You’ll be asleep during the process. The doctor will use the light and camera on the end of the tube to look at the lining of your intestine. If the doctor sees polyps or changes in the tissue, they can take some out through the tube and check it for cancer . Your doctor doesn’t put a camera into your intestine for a CT colonography. You aren’t asleep during the test. Instead, the doctor uses a CT scanner and X-rays to make 3-D pictures of your intestine on a computer screen. Is the Prep the Same? Pretty much. You may have to change what you eat for a few days and take medicine to clean out your colon. You’ll need to drink a special contrast liquid before the test. It lines the inside of your intestine and makes it easier to see on the scans. Make sure your doctor knows about all of the medicine you take. That includes drugs you can get without a prescription, like vitamins , supplements, and herbs. The doctor may ask you to stop some of these for a short time before the test. Tell your doctor if you’ve had past reactions to the contrast liquid used during X-rays. Don’t get this test if you’re pregnant . What Happens? A trained technician will do the test. You won’t need to stay in the hospital for it. You’ll lie on a narrow table. First, you’ll be on your side while they put a short, thin tube into your rectum to fill your intestine with air. This helps expand and smooth it out. It may make your belly feel full, but it shouldn’t hurt. After the air is in, the table will slide into a big, doughnut-shaped ring. The technician will leave the room but will be able to see, hear, and talk to you the entire time. They may ask you to turn or hold your breath at different times. The machine may click and whir as the scans are done. The whole thing should take 10 to 15 minutes. How Will I Feel Afterward? You may feel bloated for a while and have gas as you pass the air out of your intestine. You can go back to your normal diet . There are no activity limits. Your doctor will let you know when and how you’ll get the test results. Why Aren’t All Colon Cancer Tests Done This Way? Virtual colonoscopy has pros and cons: Pros: Fewer risks, compared with regular colonoscopy It’s easier if you’re elderly or take blood thinners . There’s no recovery time. You can go right back to your normal life. It costs less and is faster than the regular test. Cons: Your doctor isn’t looking right at your colon and might miss small changes. Insurance doesn’t always cover it. It’s low, but there is radiation exposure. If the test results show changes, you’ll have to come back for a regular colonoscopy so the doctor can remove and test the tissue."
27,What Is Vitamin B12 Deficiency Anemia?,"This type of anemia means that your body doesn't have enough healthy red blood cells because you're low in vitamin B12 . These cells transport oxygen throughout your body. You need vitamins -- including B12 -- to make them. When you don't have enough red blood cells , your body doesn’t get the oxygen it needs to work like it should. Anemia may make you feel tired, weak, and short of breath. What Causes Vitamin B12 Deficiency Anemia? You can get vitamin B12 deficiency anemia if you don't get enough vitamin B12 in your diet from foods like milk, eggs, and meat. You're more likely to be low in this vitamin if you're older, or you eat a vegetarian diet . It can also happen if your body can't absorb enough of it from the foods you eat. Your intestines absorb vitamin B12 from food. A protein your stomach makes called “intrinsic factor” helps your body absorb it. When you don't have enough, you have a type of vitamin B12 deficiency anemia called “pernicious anemia.” You can get pernicious anemia if: You have an autoimmune disease that makes your immune system attack the cells in your stomach that produce intrinsic factor. You have surgery to remove part of your stomach, where intrinsic factor is made. Your body also might not absorb enough vitamin B12 if: You have a disease that affects how nutrients are absorbed in your intestines , such as Crohn's disease , HIV , or some infections. You have certain bad bacteria in your intestines. You take some medicines, such as antibiotics and anti- seizure drugs. You've had surgery to remove part of your intestines. You've been infected with a tapeworm . How Can I Find Out If I Have It? Anemia can make you feel tired and short of breath. Here are some other signs: Your skin looks pale or yellow. You feel dizzy. You have no appetite. You've lost weight without trying. Your hands and feet feel like they're numb or tingling. Your heart beats too fast or you have chest pain . Your muscles feel weak. You often have mood changes. You're confused or forgetful. Because these can also be symptoms of other conditions, see your doctor for a diagnosis. Your doctor will do a physical exam and might order one or more of these tests: Complete blood count . This test checks the size and number of your red blood cells. If you're low in vitamin B12, your red blood cells won't look normal. They'll be much bigger and shaped differently than healthy ones. Vitamin B12 level. This test checks to see if you have enough of it in your blood. Intrinsic factor antibodies . These proteins tell your immune system to attack intrinsic factor. If you have pernicious anemia, you'll have them in your blood. Schilling test. This test uses a radioactive form of B12 to see if your body has enough intrinsic factor . Methylmalonic acid level (MMA). This test measures the amount of MMA in your blood. When your vitamin B12 level is low, your level of MMA rises. How Is It Treated? Usually, vitamin B12 deficiency anemia is easy to treat with diet and vitamin supplements . To increase the amount of vitamin B12 in your diet, eat more of foods that contain it, such as: Beef, liver, and chicken Fish and shellfish such as trout, salmon, tuna fish, and clams Fortified breakfast cereal Low- fat milk, yogurt, and cheese Eggs Your doctor might recommend that you also take a vitamin B12 supplement. It comes in pills or a nasal spray. If you are very low in this vitamin, you can get higher-dose vitamin B12 shots. You may need to take vitamin B12 for the rest of your life. You might also need to get treated for the condition that causes your anemia. But increasing your vitamin B12 levels is a key thing you can do. If you let it go for too long, it can damage your heart , brain , nerves, bones, and other organs in your body. With treatment, you should feel better and avoid any long-term problems."
28,Vitamin D Deficiency,"If you shun the sun, wear sunscreen, suffer from milk allergies, or adhere to a strict vegan diet, you may be at risk for vitamin D deficiency. Known as the sunshine vitamin, vitamin D is produced by the body in response to skin being exposed to sunlight. It also occurs naturally in a few foods -- including some fish, fish liver oils, and egg yolks -- and in fortified dairy and grain products. Vitamin D is essential for strong bones because it helps the body use calcium from the diet. Traditionally, vitamin D deficiency has been associated with rickets, a disease in which the bone tissue doesn't properly mineralize, leading to soft bones and skeletal deformities. But increasingly, research is revealing the importance of vitamin D in protecting against a host of health problems. Symptoms and Health Risks of Vitamin D Deficiency Symptoms of bone pain and muscle weakness can mean you have a vitamin D deficiency. However, for many people, the symptoms are subtle. Yet, even without symptoms, too little vitamin D can pose health risks. Low blood levels of the vitamin have been associated with the following: Increased risk of death from cardiovascular disease Cognitive impairment in older adults Severe asthma in children Cancer Research suggests that vitamin D could play a role in the prevention and treatment of a number of different conditions, including type1 and type 2 diabetes, hypertension, glucose intolerance, and multiple sclerosis . Causes of Vitamin D Deficiency Vitamin D deficiency can occur for a number of reasons: You don't consume the recommended levels of the vitamin over time . This is likely if you follow a strict vegan diet, because most of the natural sources are animal-based, including fish and fish oils, egg yolks, fortified milk, and beef liver. Here are the best vitamin d foods for vegetarians. Your exposure to sunlight is limited. Because the body makes vitamin D when your skin is exposed to sunlight, you may be at risk of deficiency if you are homebound, live in northern latitudes, wear long robes or head coverings for religious reasons, or have an occupation that prevents sun exposure. During the winter, vitamin D deficiency can be more prevalent because there is less sunlight available. You have dark skin. The pigment melanin reduces the skin's ability to make vitamin D in response to sunlight exposure. Some studies show that older adults with darker skin are at high risk of vitamin D deficiency. Your kidneys cannot convert vitamin D to its active form. As people age, their kidneys are less able to convert vitamin D to its active form, thus increasing their risk of vitamin D deficiency. Your digestive tract cannot adequately absorb vitamin D. Certain medical problems, including Crohn's disease , cystic fibrosis, and celiac disease can affect your intestine's ability to absorb vitamin D from the food you eat. You are obese. Vitamin D is extracted from the blood by fat cells, altering its release into circulation. People with a body mass index of 30 or greater often have low blood levels of vitamin D. Tests for Vitamin D Deficiency The most accurate way to measure how much vitamin D is in your body is the 25-hydroxy vitamin D blood test. A level of 20 nanograms/milliliter to 50 ng/mL is considered adequate for healthy people. A level less than 12 ng/mL indicates vitamin D deficiency. Treatment for Vitamin D Deficiency Treatment for vitamin D deficiency involves getting more vitamin D -- through diet and supplements. Although there is no consensus on vitamin D levels required for optimal health -- and it likely differs depending on age and health conditions -- a concentration of less than 20 nanograms per milliliter is generally considered inadequate, requiring treatment. Guidelines from the Institute of Medicine increased the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) of vitamin D to 600 international units (IU) for everyone ages 1-70, and raised it to 800 IU for adults older than age 70 to optimize bone health. The safe upper limit was also raised to 4,000 IU. Doctors may prescribe more than 4,000 IU to correct a vitamin D deficiency. If you don't spend much time in the sun or always are careful to cover your skin ( sunscreen inhibits vitamin D production), you should speak to your doctor about taking a vitamin D supplement, particularly if you have risk factors for vitamin D deficiency."
29,Vitiligo and Loss of Skin Color,"What Is Vitiligo? Vitiligo is a condition in which white patches develop on the skin. Any location on the body can be affected, and most people with vitiligo have white patches on many areas. Vitiligo Causes and Risk Factors The skin doesn't have its characteristic color because it has lost its melanin. For some reason, the pigment-forming cells known as melanocytes have been destroyed. We don't know why this happens. It might be an autoimmune condition, where your body's defenses turn on your own cells instead of attacking invading germs. Although vitiligo affects all races equally, it's more noticeable in dark-skinned people. .image-container-right { width: 100%; margin-bottom: 1rem; } @media screen and (min-width: 25rem) { .image-container-right { float: right; margin-left: 2rem; width: 17.5rem; } } Who Is Likely to Get It? Up to 2% of the population and an estimated 2 to 5 million Americans have the condition. It doesn't matter if you're a man or a woman. In most cases, it develops early in life, between ages 10 and 30. It will almost always show up before age 40. Vitiligo may run in families. You're more likely to get it when someone else in your family has it, too, or when people in your family get gray hair prematurely. Autoimmune diseases, such as autoimmune thyroid disease (Hashimoto's thyroiditis) or type 1 diabetes, can also raise your odds. Vitiligo Symptoms You'll often lose pigment quickly on several areas of your skin. After the white patches appear, they may stay the same for a while, but later on, they might get bigger. You may have cycles of pigment loss and stability. Vitiligo commonly affects: Body folds (like armpits) Places that have been injured in the past Areas exposed to sun Around moles Around body openings Mucous membranes (tissues that line your nose and mouth) It can also affect eyelids and hair . It's rare for pigment to return once the white patches have developed. Vitiligo Types Vitiligo is an autoimmune condition in which the pigment forming cells known as melanocytes are injured, resulting in white patches. The condition tends to progress and may even become universal. Vitiligo appears to affect all races equally but is more noticeable on those with darker skin. There are five types of vitiligo. Which type you have depends on where you have it. Generalized is the most common type. This is when discolored patches show up all over your body. Segmental is when your vitiligo is confined to one area of your body, like your face or your hands. Focal happens when the discoloration stays in one spot and doesn't spread. Trichrome is when there is an area of heavy discoloration, followed by an area of lighter discoloration, followed by regular-color skin. Universal is a rare type. If you have this, at least 80% of your skin is discolored. Vitiligo Diagnosis Your doctor can usually make a diagnosis of vitiligo by looking at your skin during a physical exam. You might also have other tests, including blood tests and: Module: image Skin biopsy, where a sample of your skin is sent to a laboratory for further examination A Wood's lamp test, where a doctor looks at your skin under UV light Vitiligo Treatment and Home Remedies There's no known way to prevent or cure vitiligo. But you can make your affected skin look better. Which treatment may work best for you depends on how old you are, how much skin needs improving, and how much your vitiligo affects you. Medications for vitiligo Vitiligo. This photo shows a large patch of vitiligo on the back neck of a child. These types of white patches develop after skin has lost its melanin when the pigment-forming cells known as melanocytes have been destroyed. The condition tends to progress and may even become universal. Sophisticated cover-up cosmetics that are now available. For some patients the application of topical corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors alone or with brief natural sunlight exposure early in the course of the disease may induce repigmentation. Varying combinations of topical or oral psoralens and ultraviolet light called PUVA (a combination of psoralen and long-wave ultraviolet radiation) are sometimes used in the treatment of vitiligo. The use of broad-spectrum sunscreens during the summer months can minimize the contrast between normal and involved skin. The FDA has approvedruxolitinib (Opzelura) cream for the treatment of nonsegmental vitiligo in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older. It has shown success in repigmentation when applied twice daily for 6 months on vitiligo areas up to 10% body surface area. Otherwise, your doctor may prescribe a corticosteroid cream to put on affected skin to try to give it its color back. It may take months to see changes in your skin. You might also see some streaks or lines on your skin, or your skin may get thinner. If your vitiligo is progressing quickly, your doctor might suggest a corticosteroid pill or injection. In rare cases, they may suggest an ointment called a calcineurin inhibitor ointment. It affects your immune system to ease inflammation. You might get it if your vitiligo is in a small area, usually around your face and neck. Doctors don't prescribe these often, as these medicines are linked to skin cancer and lymphoma . Therapies for vitiligo There are a few different techniques that can help. Phototherapy, or light therapy, using UVA light can slow or stop the progression of your vitiligo. In most cases, you'll do this in combination with any medicines your doctor prescribes. Usually, you'll get this therapy a few times a week in a doctor's office. But there are portable devices that can allow you to get treatment at home. Ask your doctor about it. Sometimes, doctors use light therapy along with a substance called psoralen. You would take psoralen by mouth or as an ointment, then get light therapy using UVA light. While this therapy is effective, it's much more difficult to give than regular phototherapy. If other treatments haven't worked and your vitiligo covers a lot of your body, your doctor may recommend a procedure called depigmentation. A substance goes on the unaffected areas of your skin once or twice a day for about 9 months. Gradually, that skin will permanently lighten so that it matches the rest of your skin. Side effects can include: Swelling Redness Itching Dry skin Talk to your doctor about which of these treatments might be right for you. Alternative medicine forvitiligo A few studies suggest that ginkgo biloba can give you some of your skin color back. Some experts also say some supplements can help phototherapy be more effective, including: Alpha-lipoic acid Folic acid Vitamin C Vitamin B12 Be sure to talk with your doctor before you take any supplement. They could affect any medicines you're already taking. Home remediesforvitiligo There are some things you can do at home to help your skin look better: Cover affected skin with makeup or tanning products. Use sunscreen (at least SPF 30) when you’re outside, and reapply it every 2 hours. Stay away from tanning beds. Don't get tattoos. The damage they do to your skin can cause more vitiligo. Surgery for vitiligo If other treatments haven't worked for you, your doctor may recommend surgery. The goal of these procedures is to even out the tone of your skin. Skin grafting is where a surgeon transfers healthy portions of your skin to the discolored areas. Your doctor might suggest this if you have small patches of vitiligo. In blister grafting, your surgeon will use suction to create blisters on your healthy skin, then move the top of those blisters to your discolored skin. A cellular suspension transplant is when your doctor takes tissues of your healthy skin, puts them into a solution, and moves them onto your discolored skin. Results of this may take weeks to show up. Your doctor will let you know if one of these procedures can help you. Complications of vitiligo If you have vitiligo, you may be more likely to get: Sunburn Eye issues Hearing loss The changes in your appearance can also make you feel down, stressed, or self-conscious. A lot of things can help, including: Talking about it with friends and family Finding a support group, either in person or online, so you can talk with people going through the same things you are. Seeing a doctor who knows a lot about the condition, so they can find the best treatment and help for you. Be sure to tell your doctor if you feel depressed. They can recommend a mental health professional who can help you feel better."
30,Why Am I Losing My Voice?,"Maybe you first notice something is wrong when your normally clear-as-a-bell voice gets a little bit husky. Pretty soon all that your friends can hear is a lot of croaking when you try to speak up. Too much singing in the shower, you wonder, or is something more serious to blame? Check out these culprits that could explain why you're hoarse. A Cold When you speak, air passes through the voice box in your throat and hits the two bands called vocal cords. Your voice makes sounds when they vibrate. A cold can throw a wrench into this smooth-running machine. Your throat gets inflamed and sore. Then your vocal cords swell, which affects the way they vibrate. The end result: You're hoarse. Rest your voice and drink plenty of fluids. Your volume will return when you recover. Learn more ways to treat the common cold . You Use Your Voice Too Much Each time you talk or sing, you use different muscles, including some in your mouth and throat. Just like other muscles in your body, overuse of the ones that help you speak can lead to fatigue , strain, and injury. The wrong technique can also bring on hoarseness. Here are some common things that you may be doing wrong: Speak, sing, yell, or cough too much Use a pitch that's higher or lower than normal when you talk Cradle your phone between your head and shoulder Smoking Cigarette smoke irritates your vocal cords, which can lead to long-term voice problems. Studies show that former and current smokers are about three times more likely to have a voice disorder than people who never smoke. Smoking can also raise your risk of developing a small, noncancerous growth called a polyp on your vocal cords. It can cause your voice to become low, breathy, and hoarse. Find out how smoking can also affect your heart. Allergies When you think about allergies, you probably think of a runny nose, itchy eyes , and sneezing . But they can also take a toll on your voice in several ways: An allergic reaction can cause your vocal cords to swell. Postnasal drip -- when mucus moves from your nose into your throat -- can irritate your vocal cords. Coughing and clearing your throat can strain your vocal cords. Antihistamine drugs for allergies can dry out mucus in your throat. This may harm your vocal cords, which need moisture to work. Learn ways you can allergy-proof your environment. Rheumatoid Arthritis It's an autoimmune disease that causes pain, swelling, and stiffness in your joints. About 1 in 3 people with RA get vocal problems, including a sore throat and loss of voice. That's because the condition can affect tiny joints in your face and throat, which leads to problems with your breathing and the way your vocal cords work. Read more about how RA can affect your body . Trouble With Your Thyroid This butterfly-shaped gland in your lower neck pumps out a hormone that controls a number of functions in your body. When your thyroid doesn't make enough of it, one symptom you might have is a hoarse voice. If you have a goiter -- when your thyroid gets larger -- you may cough a lot and have problems with your speech. A growth on the thyroid , or a nodule, can also affect the way you speak. Learn more about thyroid nodules . GERD It's a condition that makes stomach acid wash back up into the esophagus , a tube that leads into your throat. The main symptom is heartburn, but GERD can also weaken your voice. Stomach acid can irritate your vocal cords, throat, and esophagus. This leads to a hoarse voice, wheezing, and too much mucus in your throat. Find out how GERD is diagnosed and treated . Laryngitis It's not a disease, but a catch-all word that means you've lost your voice. If it happens suddenly, it's called ""acute"" laryngitis. You can get it from a cold or overusing your voice. You can get long-term laryngitis if you breathe in something irritating, like smoke or chemical fumes. It also develops if you get yeast infections of the vocal cords, which can happen if you use asthma inhalers or have problems with your immune system, the body's defense against germs. Learn more about laryngitis symptoms . Nodules, Polyps, and Cysts Although experts aren't sure why, non-cancerous growths can appear on your vocal cords. They believe that heavy overuse of the voice, such as too much yelling or speaking, can be a cause. There are three types: Nodules. These callus -like formations usually grow in the middle of the vocal cord. They tend to go away if you give your voice enough rest. Polyps. These typically appear on one side of the vocal cord. They have a variety of sizes and shapes. Unlike nodules, they often need to be removed surgically. Cysts. They're fluid-filled or semi-solid masses of tissue that grow near or beneath the surface of your vocal cord. If they make serious changes to your voice, your doctor will likely recommend surgery to remove them. Nervous System Diseases A condition that affects your nerves, like Parkinson's disease, can affect the muscles in your face and throat. Nearly 90% of people with Parkinson's get some form of a speech or voice disorder. Parkinson's causes the parts of the brain that control movement and coordination to decline. This may mean that you're no longer able to control the muscles needed for speech. Learn how doctors diagnose Parkinson's disease . Laryngeal Cancer Long-term hoarseness or voice loss may be a sign of throat cancer. Other symptoms for the disease are: Pain when swallowing Pain in the ear Trouble breathing Lump in the neck Get more information on throat cancer diagnosis and treatment . If your voice problems last for more than 2 weeks, see a doctor."
31,Neurofibromatosis,"What Is Neurofibromatosis? Neurofibromatosis is a genetic disorder of the nervous system . Tumors form on your nerve tissues. Mainly, neurofibromatosis disorders affect the growth and development of nerve cell tissue. The disorders are known as neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2). NF1 is the more common type of neurofibromatosis. Schwannomatosis has recently been identified as a third and more rare type of neurofibromatosis, but doctors don’t know much about it yet. You may also hear NF1 called Recklinghausen disease, von Recklinghausen disease, von Recklinghausen’s phakomatosis, von Recklinghausen’s neurofibromatosis, neurofibroma (multiple), neurofibromatosis- pheochromocytoma -duodenal carcinoid syndrome , or peripheral neurofibromatosis. It causes multiple café au lait spots (patches of tan or light brown skin) and neurofibromas (soft, fleshy growths) on or under your skin . It can also cause enlarged or deformed bones and curvature of the spine ( scoliosis ). Occasionally, tumors may develop in the brain, on cranial nerves, or on the spinal cord. About 50% to 75% of people with NF1 also have learning disabilities . Neurofibromatosis, neurofibromas. Neurofibromatosis is a genetic disorder of the nervous system which causes tumors to form on your nerve tissues. It causes multiple patches of tan or light brown skin and soft, fleshy growths known as neurofibromas to grow on or under your skin. NF2 is also called bilateral acoustic neurofibromatosis, vestibular schwannoma neurofibromatosis, or central neurofibromatosis. It’s much less common than NF1 and is characterized by multiple tumors on the cranial and spinal nerves. Tumors that affect both of the auditory nerves and hearing loss beginning in the teens or early 20s are generally the first symptoms of NF2. Neurofibromatosis Symptoms Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) symptoms The following symptoms appear in people with NF1: Neurofibromatosis. Also called Recklinghausen’s disease, neurofibromatosis is characterized by areas of pigmentation like this café au lait spot on a 16-year-old. NF1 is a genetic disorder of the nervous system causing neurofibromas (tumors) to grow on the fibrous covering of nerves. Spots like this one can appear on the skin and can sometimes be accompanied by physical deformation. Most are benign but they can become malignant and those with NF1 have a predisposition to brain tumors and various forms of cancer. People with this disorder should seek genetic counseling before planning a child. Dermatologists look for more than six cafe au lait macules greater than 5mm in greatest diameter in pre-pubescent kids and greater than 15 mm in postpubertal people to initiate a workup for Neurofibromatosis 1. Several (usually 6 or more) café au lait spots Multiple freckles in the armpit or groin area Tiny growths in the iris (colored area) of the eye ; these are called Lisch nodules and usually do not affect eyesight . Neurofibromas that occur on or under the skin, sometimes even deep within the body. These are benign (harmless) tumors. But in rare cases, they can turn malignant or cancerous. Bone deformities, including a twisted spine (scoliosis) or bowed legs Tumors along the optic nerve, which may cause eyesight problems Nerve-related pain High blood pressure Osteoporosis Learning disabilities Large head size Short stature Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) symptoms People with NF2 often display the following symptoms: Loss of hearing Weakness of the muscles of the face Dizziness Poor balance Uncoordinated walking Cataracts (cloudy areas on the lens of the eye ) that develop at an unusually early age Headaches Schwannomatosis symptoms People with schwannomatosis may have the following symptoms: Pain from the enlarging tumors Numbness and tingling of the fingers or toes Weakness in the fingers and toes Chronic pain Loss of muscle Neurofibromatosis Causes Neurofibromatosis: Crowe's Sign is freckling in the armpit of those with neurofibromatosis type I (von Recklinghausen's disease). Neurofibromatosis is a genetic disorder of the nervous system which affect the growth and development of nerve cell tissue. These freckles occur in up to 30% of people with the disease and their presence is one of six diagnostic criteria for neurofibromatosis. Freckles can also appear in the groin area, along the jaw and in the nape of the neck. Neurofibromatosis is often inherited (passed on by family members through your genes). But about 50% of people newly diagnosed with the disorder have no family history of the condition. That’s because it can result from a sudden mutation (change) in your genes. Once this change takes place, you can pass the mutant gene on to future generations. Mutations that lead to neurofibromatosis include: Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1): The NF1 gene on chromosome 17 makes a protein called neurofibromin that controls your cells’ growth. The mutation of this gene causes a neurofibromin loss and uncontrolled cell growth. Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2): The NF2 gene on chromosome 22 makes a protein called merlin or schwannomin. It suppresses tumors. Changes to this gene cause a loss of merlin and uncontrolled cell growth. Schwannomatosis: Mutations of the two known genes linked to schwannomatosis, SMARCB1 and LZTR1, which both suppress tumors, are associated with this type of neurofibromatosis. Neurofibromatosis Diagnosis Neurofibromatosis is diagnosed using a number of tests, including: Physical examination Medical history Family history X-rays Computerized tomography (CT) scans Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) Biopsy of neurofibromas Eye tests Tests for particular symptoms, such as hearing or balance tests Genetic testing To receive a diagnosis of NF1, you must have two of the following features: Six or more café au lait spots that are 1.5 centimeters or larger in people who have had puberty, or 0.5 centimeters or larger in people who haven’t Two or more neurofibromas (tumors that develop from the cells and tissues that cover nerves) of any type, or one or more plexiform neurofibroma (a nerve that has become thick and misshapen due to the abnormal growth of cells and tissues that cover the nerve) Freckling in the armpit or groin Optic glioma (tumor of the optic pathway) Two or more Lisch nodules A distinctive bony lesion, dysplasia of the sphenoid bone, or dysplasia or thinning of long bone cortex A first-degree relative with NF1 To be diagnosed with NF2, you must have: Bilateral (on both sides) vestibular schwannomas, also known as acoustic neuromas. These are benign tumors that develop from the balance and hearing nerves supplying the inner ear . or Family history of NF2 (first-degree family relative) plus unilateral (on one side) or bilateral vestibular schwannomas, or any two of the following health conditions: Multiple meningiomas (tumors that occur in the meninges, the membranes that cover and protect the brain and spinal cord) Glioma ( cancer of the brain that begins in glial cells, which are those that surround and support nerve cells) Any neurofibromas Schwannoma Juvenile cataracts Gradual hearing loss Ringing in the ears Balance problems Headaches Schwannomatosis diagnosis is based on these criteria: If you’re 30 or older, you have no evidence of vestibular tumors on an MRI scan, no known NF2 gene mutation, and two or more schwannomas within or between skin layers, one being confirmed by a biopsy. You have one schwannoma confirmed by biopsy and a first-degree relative who also meets the criteria. If you have a type called segmental schwannomatosis, you have tumors limited to one area of the body, such as your arm, leg, or spine. Neurofibromatosis Treatment There’s no cure for neurofibromatosis. Treatments focus on controlling symptoms. There’s no standard treatment for NF, and many symptoms, such as café au lait spots, do not need treatment. When treatment is necessary, options may include: Surgery to remove problem growths or tumors Treatment that includes chemotherapy or radiation if a tumor has turned malignant, or cancerous Surgery for bone problems, like scoliosis Therapy (including physical therapy , counseling , or support groups) Cataract removal surgery Aggressive treatment of pain linked to the condition Stereotactic radiosurgery Auditory brainstem and cochlear implants Neurofibromatosis Complications Neurofibromatosis complications may vary from person to person. They typically stem from a growing tumor pressing against your nerve tissue or an internal organ. Possible NF1 complications include: Neurological problems like trouble learning or thinking Anxiety or distress with changes to your appearance, like large numbers of cafe au lait spots Skeletal problems, like bowing of the legs, scoliosis, fractures that don’t heal, or low bone density that increases your risk of osteoporosis Vision problems due to a tumor pressing against the optic nerve Problems during times of hormonal changes, such as puberty or pregnancy Cardiovascular problems like high blood pressure Breathing problems Higher risk of some cancers, such as breast cancer , leukemia , colorectal cancer, brain tumors , and some soft tissue cancers Benign adrenal gland tumor that could cause high blood pressure Possible NF2 complications include: Partial hearing loss or deafness Nerve damage in the face Benign skin tumors or schwannomas Vision problems Weakness or numbness in your extremities Benign brain or spine tumors that need to be removed with surgery One possible schwannomatosis complication is severe pain that requires specialist medical treatment or even surgery. Neurofibromatosis Outlook Your outlook depends on the type of NF you have. Often, the symptoms of NF1 are mild, and people who have it are able to lead full and productive lives. Sometimes, pain and deformity can lead to significant disability. The NF2 outlook depends on your age at the start of the disease and on the number and location of tumors. Some can be life-threatening."
32,What Is von Willebrand Disease?,"Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is a disorder that makes it hard for your blood to clot. This happens because you don’t have enough of a clotting protein called von Willebrand factor (VWF). It could also happen because you have a type of VWF that doesn’t work well. If you have von Willebrand disease, a cut, accident, or surgery can result in bleeding that’s hard to stop. VWD is the most common inherited bleeding disorder. That means you get it from your parents. It affects an estimated 1 in 100 to 1 in 1,000 people. Types of VWD There are three types of inherited VWD and one type of the disorder that isn’t hereditary. Type 1: This is the most common form of inherited VWD. About 60% to 80% of people with VWD have this type. With Type 1, you don’t have enough von Willebrand factor in your blood . Typically, you have 20% to 50% of normal levels. Symptoms of Type 1 VWD are mild. Type 2: This is the second most common form of inherited VWD. It’s caused by your own VWD factor not working well. If you have VWD, there’s a 15% to 30% chance you have Type 2. Symptoms range from mild to moderate. Type 3: This is the rarest form of inherited VWD. It’s found in 5% to 10% of cases. If you have this type, you typically have no von Willebrand factor and very low levels of another protein needed for clotting. Type 3 has the most severe symptoms. Acquired: It’s possible to get this form of VWD if you have an autoimmune disease , like lupus . An autoimmune disease is one where your body’s natural defense system ( immune system ) fights itself. You can also get acquired VWD after taking certain medications , or from heart disease or some types of cancer . What Causes It? Most of the time, you inherit VWD from one or both parents. You can inherit Type 1 or Type 2 if one of your parents passes the gene on to you. You usually only get Type 3 if both of your parents pass the gene to you. It’s possible to have the gene that causes the disorder but not have any symptoms. In that case, you can still pass the gene to your children. What Are the Symptoms? It depends on what type of von Willebrand disease you have. With Type 1 and Type 2, your symptoms can range from mild to moderate. They include: Frequent large bruises from minor injuries Frequent or hard-to-stop nose bleeds Blood in your stool or pee (from internal bleeding ) Heavy bleeding after a cut, accident, or minor medical procedure Bleeding for a long period of time after major surgery Heavy or long menstrual periods If you’re a woman with VWD, you’ll have periods with clots larger than an inch in diameter. This means you may need to change your pad or tampon more than every hour. You’ll also likely develop anemia (low iron in the blood). These are symptoms of von Willebrand disease, but by themselves, they don’t prove you have VWD. With Type 3, you may have all the symptoms of Type 1 and Type 2, plus episodes of severe bleeding for no reason. You also might experience severe pain and swelling in your soft tissues and joints because of bleeding. How Is It Diagnosed? If your doctor suspects you have von Willebrand disease, they’ll start with a detailed medical history. Remember, VWD is almost always inherited. Your family medical history will show if you’ve experienced typical symptoms or if other relatives have a bleeding disorder or symptoms of one. You might have to take a clotting test to see how well your blood can form a clot and how long it takes. Your doctor may also order several blood tests, such as an antigen test. This shows how much VWF you have in your blood plasma. Levels of VWF go up and down because of things like stress and exercise . For this reason, you might have to have these tests more than once to confirm the results. What’s the Treatment? There’s no cure for von Willebrand disease, but it can be treated and/or managed. A key to managing this disorder is to reduce the risk of bleeding before it starts. This means avoiding certain drugs that can thin your blood. Your doctor might recommend you avoid aspirin and medications known as NSAIDs , such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin ) and naproxen ( Aleve ). Acetominophen ( Tylenol ) is a good alternative to aspirin and NSAIDs. How your condition is treated will depend on how severe your symptoms are. With Type 1, you typically only need treatment if have you have surgery, a tooth extraction, or are injured. The most common treatment for von Willebrand disease is desmopressin acetate ( DDAVP ). It’s available as an injection or a nasal spray. DDAVP is a synthetic form of the hormone vasopressin. It causes the release of von Willebrand factor from your cells. A side effect of this hormone is that it causes your body to retain water . As a result, you will need to be on fluid restrictions if you’re taking the medication. Your doctor might also recommend that you get clotting factor concentrates through an IV. If you’re going to have a dental procedure, you may need to take aminocaproic acid or tranexamic acid . These prevent the breakdown of blood clots . You take these medications by mouth , either in liquid or pill form. You may also take them if you're bleeding from your nose or mouth , or if you have heavy bleeding with your period. If you’re a woman with VWD and heavy periods , your treatment may also include birth control pills . These can increase the amount of von Willebrand factor in your blood. Another possible treatment is a levonorgestrel intrauterine device . This is a type of birth control that contains the hormone progestin. If you’re done having children or don’t want any, you can also have an endometrial ablation. This procedure destroys the lining of the uterus and reduces the amount of blood you lose during your period. If you have Type 3 and are experiencing bleeding, you need to get treatment right away. Bleeding episodes can be fatal if not treated immediately."
33,Vulvar Cancer,"What Is Vulvar Cancer? Vulvar cancer is when cancerous cells grow out of control on or in the vulva, the outer part of a woman’s genitals. It’s different from vaginal cancer , which starts inside the vagina . A woman’s vulva includes: The opening of the vagina. This is the tubelike channel that leads out from their uterus. The labia. These are two sets of skin folds that look like lips. The labia majora are the fleshy set on the outside. The labia minora are thinner and set inside them. The clitoris. This is a sensitive knob of tissue under a hood of skin where the labia minora meet. The mons pubis. This is the soft mound in front of their pubic bones that becomes covered with hair in puberty . The perineum. This is the patch of skin between their vulva and anus . Vulvar Cancer Symptoms You might not notice any symptoms early on. Over time, you might have: A change in the color of your vulva Unusual growths or bumps that may be red, pink, or white and feel rough or thick A change in how a mole looks Thickened skin on your vulva An open sore Itching that doesn’t go away Pain , soreness, or burning Unusual vaginal bleeding or discharge Pain when you pee These can also be signs of other conditions, so talk to your doctor if you spot problems. Types of Vulvar Cancer There are several main forms of this disease. Squamous cell carcinoma . This is the most common type. It starts in your skin cells. It might be linked to the human papillomavirus ( HPV ), especially in younger women. A subtype called verrucous carcinoma grows slowly and can look like a wart . Adenocarcinoma . This type usually starts in cells in the Bartholin’s glands just inside the opening of your vagina. This is also called Bartholin gland cancer. It can look like a cyst . It also can form in sweat glands in the skin of your vulva or in the top layer of vulvar skin, which is called Paget’s disease. Melanoma . This type forms in cells that make pigment, or skin color. You’re more likely to get it on skin that’s exposed to the sun, but it sometimes forms on your vulva. Sarcoma . This starts in bone , muscle, or connective tissue cells. It can happen at any age, including in childhood. Basal cell carcinoma . This is the most common type of skin cancer . It usually appears on skin that’s exposed to the sun, rarely on the vulva. Vulvar Cancer Causes and Risk Factors The exact causes of vulvar cancer aren’t clear. But certain things can raise your chances of getting it. These include: Age. More than half of cases are in women over age 70. A history of unusual Pap tests HIV or AIDS HPV Melanoma or unusual moles A family history of melanoma A precancerous condition like vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN). These are changes in cells or tissue that can happen years before you’re diagnosed with cancer. Vaginal or cervical cancer Lichen sclerosus, a condition that makes vulvar skin thin and itchy Smoking , especially if you’ve also had HPV Vulvar Cancer Diagnosis Your appointment might include: A medical history. Your doctor will ask about your overall health, including habits and illnesses. A pelvic exam . They’ll check your vulva for signs of cancer by looking at the area and feeling your uterus, vagina , ovaries, bladder , and rectum. Colposcopy . A magnifying tool called a colposcope can give a close-up look at any problem areas in your vagina, vulva, and cervix . This procedure is also called a vulvoscopy. Biopsy . Your doctor might take a bit of tissue for a specialist to look at under a microscope. Imaging tests . X-rays, CT and PET scans, and MRIs make detailed pictures of the inside of your body to tell your doctor if you have cancer or how far it’s spread. Vulvar Cancer Stages If tests show signs of cancer, your doctor will look at how big the tumor is and whether it’s spread. This is called staging. Stage I. The tumor is small and hasn’t spread past your vulva and perineum. Stage II. The cancer has moved into nearby tissues but not your lymph nodes . Stage III. It’s spread to nearby tissues and to the lymph nodes in your groin. Stage IV. Cancer has reached the upper part of your vagina, urethra, or anus, or a part of your body that’s farther away. Vulvar Cancer Treatment Treatment depends on many things, including the type of cancer, how far it’s spread, and your overall health. The four main treatments are: Surgery. This is the most common. Your doctor might use one of these procedures: Ultrasound surgical aspiration . Sound waves break up the tumor into small pieces, and your doctor takes them out. Laser surgery. They use a laser to cut into or take out affected tissue such as your lymph nodes, parts of your vulva, or other organs. This treatment is not used for invasive tumors. Excision. Your doctor takes out the tumor and tissue around it. A wide local excision removes some of the tissue. A radical local excision takes out a large amount of tissue and possibly lymph nodes. Vulvectomy. Part or all of your vulva is removed. There are several types: Skinning vulvectomy. Your doctor takes the top layer of skin off your vulva. Simple vulvectomy. This procedure removes your entire vulva and tissue just under the skin. Partial or modified radical vulvectomy. This involves removing most of your vulva and possibly nearby lymph nodes. Radical vulvectomy. Your doctor removes the entire vulva and nearby lymph nodes. Pelvic exenteration. This procedure removes your vulva and lymph nodes as well as one or more of the nearby organs: your lower colon , rectum, bladder, uterus, cervix, or vagina. Radiation therapy . This uses high-powered X-rays or other forms of radiation to kill cancer. Your doctor might use a machine that beams the rays into your body or implant a radioactive needle or seed inside your body, on or near the cancer. Chemotherapy (“chemo”). This uses medicines to kill or stop the growth of cancer cells. You can take these drugs by mouth or through an IV. Some kinds come as a lotion or cream that you put on your skin. Biologic therapy, or immunotherapy . This targets your immune system to boost your body’s defenses against cancer. Vulvar Cancer Outlook After treatment, you’ll see your doctor often for follow-ups. You may need to have pelvic exams every 3 to 6 months for 2 years, and then every 6 to 12 months for 3 to 5 years. Your doctor might also recommend more screening tests. Your results will depend on the type of cancer and its stage. Overall, more than 70% of women who have vulvar cancer live at least 5 years after they’re diagnosed. The 5-year survival rate is 86% for women whose cancer hasn’t spread beyond their vulva. If it’s spread to nearby tissues or lymph nodes, the rate is 53%. Of women whose cancer has spread farther in their body, about 23% live 5 more years. Experts estimate that 1,350 women in the United States die of vulvar cancer each year. Side effects of vulvar cancer treatment Before you start treatment, talk to your doctor about what to expect, including possible side effects. Wound problems are common after vulvar surgery. It’s important to keep the area clean and practice good hygiene. Surgery, radiation, or chemo can also cause: Irritation or damage to your bowels or bladder. This may lead to changes in your bathroom habits, but they often go away within a few weeks. Scarring, dryness, and shrinking of tissue in your vagina Discomfort when wearing tight pants Urinary infections Fluid-filled cysts near the wound Blood clots that can travel to your lungs Severe swelling in your legs because of a buildup of lymphatic fluid ( lymphedema ) An opening between your bladder or rectum and vagina (fistula) Keep your medical team updated on any treatment side effects so they can help you manage them. Vulvar cancer and sex It’s common to have some sexual and psychological issues after treatment for vulvar cancer. Your body might look or feel different. You could have pain during sex and a hard time reaching orgasm or even peeing. Don’t hesitate to talk to your medical team about these changes and what steps you can take. Counseling can help, or you might choose to have reconstructive surgery. Vulvar Cancer Prevention You can lower your risk of vulvar cancer with a few lifestyle changes: Avoid HPV. Limit your number of sex partners. Practice safe sex , including using condoms . Get the HPV vaccine , which can help prevent genital warts and several kinds of cancer. Don’t smoke.
