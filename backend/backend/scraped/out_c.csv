0,Hereditary Angioedema (HAE),"What Is Hereditary Angioedema? Hereditary angioedema is a rare genetic condition that causes swelling under the skin and lining of the gut and lungs. It can happen in different parts of your body. You are born with hereditary angioedema (HAE). Although you’ll always have it, treatment helps you manage it. There have been big improvements in treatment, and researchers continue to look for new solutions. Symptoms most often initially show up in childhood and get worse during the teen years. Many people don't know HAE is causing their swelling until they're adults. Where you have it on your body, how often the bouts happen, and how strong they are different for everyone. The attacks can come and go as well as move to different spots during the same bout. The swelling typically goes away on its own but can also occur as a life-threatening event. Your throat can swell. That can cut off your airways and could be deadly. So if you know you have HAE and you feel any change like that, call 911 right away. The frequency of attacks can vary. You can have attacks as often as every 1 to 2 weeks or 1 to 2 per year, and they can be hard to manage. Causes With this disease, a certain protein in your body is not in balance. This causes tiny blood vessels to push fluid into nearby areas of your body. That leads to sudden swelling. A problem with a gene that makes a blood protein called C1 inhibitor often causes HAE. In most cases, you don’t have enough of this protein. In others, you have normal levels but it doesn't work right. For the most common form of HAE, if one of your parents has HAE, you have a 50% change of having it, too. But sometimes the gene change happens for unknown reasons. If you have the broken gene, you can pass it on to your children. Symptoms The main symptom is swelling. You won’t have the itching or hives that people often get with allergic reactions. A bout may last 2 to 5 days. It can happen in different parts of the body: Mouth or throat Hands Feet Face Genitals Belly Swelling in the throat is the most dangerous symptom. Puffiness in the feet and hands can be painful and make it hard to go about your daily life. Swelling in your belly can cause: Extreme pain Nausea Vomiting Diarrhea You may notice warning signs before swelling begins. These may include: Extreme fatigue Muscle ache Tingling Headache Belly pain Hoarseness Mood changes Triggers Although you may not be able to tell what your triggers are, common ones include: Stress or anxiety Minor injury or surgery Illnesses such as colds or flu Physical activities such as typing, hammering, or pushing a lawn mower Medications, including some used for high blood pressure and congestive heart failure Women may notice a difference in the number or sharpness of attacks when they: Have their period Are pregnant. For some women, it doesn't happen as often when they’re pregnant, but then the attacks come back after they give birth. Use birth control or hormone replacement therapy containing estrogen. Women usually say they have more and worse attacks while on these medicines. Getting a Diagnosis If you've had symptoms of HAE, your doctor may ask: What changes have you noticed? Where have you had swelling? How often? Have you had any in your face, neck, tongue, or throat? Have you noticed any changes that happen before swelling begins? Have you had any stomach problems or stomach surgery? Does anyone in your family have a problem with swelling? Have you or anyone in your family been treated for allergies? The right diagnosis is key. Sometimes people are treated for allergies when it's really HAE that causes their swelling. Antihistamines and corticosteroids that treat allergies don’t work well for this disease. You can have severe stomach swelling, pain, and diarrhea and severe dehydration and if misdiagnosed, it can lead to surgery you don't need. Your doctor will do a physical exam. You'll need blood tests, too, to confirm that it’s HAE. If you do have it, ask your doctor to refer you to a specialist familiar with the condition. You should also ask your doctor about having other members of your family tested, even if no one has symptoms. Questions for Your Doctor Do I need more tests? What can I expect from this condition? Which treatments do you recommend? What are their side effects? What should I do if my throat swells? How likely is that? How can I find out what triggers my attacks? Will I pass this condition on to my children? Should my family get tested for HAE? Will this affect my plans to have a family? Treatment Doctors can use medications to treat or prevent attacks: Berotralstat (Orladeyo) C1 esterase inhibitor ( Berinert , Cinryze , Haegarda) Conestat alfa ( Ruconest ) Ecallantide ( Kalbitor ) Icatibant ( Firazyr ) Lanadelumab-flyo ( Takhzyro ) You may also need oxygen or IV fluids to ease your symptoms. Your doctor will make recommendations for what you need. Taking Care of Yourself Learn as much as you can about HAE so you can make informed decisions about your treatment and medications that you should be cautious with. If you can figure out your triggers, you can better avoid them. It helps to track your attacks and symptoms in a journal and look for patterns. Talk to your doctor before you have any dental work. They may want you to take medication to avoid a flare. Also talk with your doctor before you take any new prescription medicines. There is a chance they could trigger an attack. Carry your medical information with you at all times. If your child has HAE, note any changes in behavior that you see before an attack. As they get older, they'll need to learn their triggers and treatment needs. Make sure all caregivers and family members know about the condition and what to do if an attack happens. Remember: Any swelling in the throat is an emergency. Take your medication for attacks and call 911. Connect with others who are living with HAE. They can share their insights and tips to help you manage your symptoms. What to Expect There's no cure for HAE, but new treatments have made it possible for people to manage their symptoms and enjoy active lives. Getting Support To learn more about HAE and to find the support of others who have it, visit the website of the U.S. Hereditary Angioedema Association at www.haea.org."
1,What Is Coronary Artery Disease?,"Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common type of heart disease. Although it’s the top cause of death in the U.S., there is a lot you can do to prevent or treat it. The trouble starts when a waxy substance called plaque builds up inside the arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle. It can take decades to block the blood flow, but it can eventually cause a heart attack or failure. How common is coronary artery disease? An estimated 18.2 million Americans have coronary artery disease, or about one in 20 adults, making it the most common form of heart disease in the country. The condition is also the leading cause of death in the U.S. In 2021 alone, 375,476 people died of coronary artery disease, and 20% were younger than 65. Coronary artery disease vs. heart attack Coronary artery disease is a form of heart disease, and most heart attacks are caused by coronary artery disease. Some people only discover they have coronary artery disease after they've had a heart attack. Forms of Coronary Artery Disease Coronary artery disease isn’t just one disease, but several different conditions. Stable ischemic heart disease: If you have this type of CAD, blood and oxygen have to work harder than normal to flow to your heart. This condition can be managed with medicines that reduce your heart’s workload and/or surgery. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS): Blood flow is sometimes suddenly reduced to your heart. Because that can lead to a heart attack, ACS is treated like an emergency. If you have severe chest pain, seek help right away. Atherosclerotic coronary artery disease: Over time, a sticky, fatty substance called plaque can build up in your arteries. That makes it harder for blood to get through and raises your risk for a heart attack or stroke. Atherosclerotic coronary artery disease is when plaque builds up along the walls of the arteries to your heart. (Photo credit: iStock/Getty Images) What Causes Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)? Starting as early as childhood, plaque – a combination of cholesterol, fat, and other substances – starts to stick to the walls lining your blood vessels. It builds up over time. That makes arteries harder and narrower, which doctors call “atherosclerosis.“ In some cases, plaque can break or rupture. As a result, blood cells called platelets will try to repair the artery, forming a blood clot. Like gunk in a clogged drainpipe, this buildup prevents a free flow of blood through the arteries. Blood carries oxygen and nutrients to the heart. Myocardial ischemia is when your heart muscle don’t get enough blood, and it can lead to shortness of breath and chest pain (angina). Without enough oxygen, the heart can become weaker. This can lead to an irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia). It can also cause heart failure, which means the heart can’t pump enough blood throughout the body to meet the body's needs. If you have limited blood flow to your arms or legs, this condition is called peripheral artery disease. If a plaque grows so large that it stops blood flow to the heart muscle, you could have a heart attack. But most of the time, heart attacks happen from the smaller plaques that rupture. Coronary Artery Disease Symptoms In the early stages, you may not have any symptoms. But as the plaque continues to build up and curbs blood flow to the heart muscle, you may notice that you’re short of breath or fatigued, especially during exercise. The most common symptom of CAD is angina, or chest pain. Some people mistake it for heartburn or indigestion. With angina, your chest feels uncomfortable. You may also have that feeling in the shoulders, arms, back, or jaw. You may feel: Tightness Discomfort Pressure Heaviness Squeezing Burning Aching Numbness Fullness Symptoms of CAD for women Women and those assigned female at birth often have different heart attack symptoms than men or those assigned male at birth. While the most common red flag is still chest pain, women are more likely to have other symptoms, such as shortness of breath, extreme fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and back or jaw pain. When to call 911 If you have any of the following symptoms, call 911 right away : Chest pain , especially in the center or left side of the chest, which lasts for a few minutes or goes away and comes back. It can feel like pressure, squeezing, fullness, or pain. Some people mistake it for indigestion or heartburn. Discomfort in any part of your upper body. It could be in one or both arms, the shoulders, neck, jaw, or upper part of the stomach. Shortness of breath with or without chest discomfort Nausea or vomiting with lightheadedness, dizziness, or a cold sweat Coronary Artery Disease Risk Factors Coronary artery disease becomes more likely as you get older or if it runs in your family. Other risk factors include High cholesterol (especially LDL, or “bad” cholesterol) and triglycerides High blood pressure Atherosclerosis (hardening or thickening of the arteries) Smoking or vaping Metabolic syndrome Diabetes Autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease Kidney disease HIV or AIDS Obesity and being overweight Lack of exercise Stress, depression, and anger Unhealthy diet Too much alcohol Sleep disorders, including sleep apnea Sleep loss Anemia Men, and people assigned male gender at birth, have a higher risk for CAD after age 45. For women and people who were assigned female gender at birth, the risk goes up after 55. Some risk factors that affect women (and those assigned female at birth) in particular are: Having eclampsia, preeclampsia, or gestational diabetes while pregnant Use of hormonal birth control methods like the pill Menopause before age 40 Endometriosis Coronary Artery Disease Disparities You’re more likely to have coronary artery disease, sometimes called coronary heart disease, if you’re over 35 or male. Black, Hispanic, and Southeast Asian people are more likely to get sick from CAD and to die from it than other ethnic groups. American Indians are 1.5 times more likely to be diagnosed with CAD than White people. In fact, minorities are at higher risk from all types of heart disease. Among Black people, 47% are diagnosed with some type of cardiovascular (heart and blood vessel) disease. For White people, the rate is 36%. Overall, Black people are more than twice as likely as White people to die from heart disease. Black, Hispanic, and American Indian people are also more likely to have conditions that contribute to heart disease, like high blood pressure, obesity, and diabetes. There are many possible reasons for these disparities. They include: Income differences Lack of access to quality health care Racism in health care and society, and the stress that results from it Coronary Artery Disease Diagnosis Your doctor will give you a checkup and talk with you about your symptoms, risks, and family history. You may also get tests such as: Electrocardiogram ( EKG ), which measures the heart’s electrical activity and can assess heart damage Stress test, which usually involves walking on a treadmill or pedaling a stationary bike in a doctor’s office while your heart rate and blood pressure are monitored Chest X-ray Blood tests to check on your levels of blood sugar, cholesterol, and triglycerides (a type of fat in the blood) Cardiac catheterization , in which a doctor guides a very thin, flexible tube (called a catheter) through a blood vessel in your arm or leg to reach your heart. The doctor injects dye through the catheter and then uses X-ray videos to see inside your heart. How to check for heart blockage at home There’s no home test that can determine whether you have coronary artery disease. But if you’re concerned about your heart health in general, there are steps you can take to keep tabs on it: Heart rate measurement. Check your pulse to figure out how fast your heartbeat is: Put two fingers on the inside of your wrist, in a spot where you can feel your pulse. Set your phone timer or a stopwatch for 10 seconds, then count the number of pulses you feel during that time. Multiply this number by 6 to calculate your heart rate for a full minute. A healthy rate is between 60 and 100 beats per minute. If yours is much higher or lower than that, tell your doctor. Blood pressure cuff. Because high blood pressure raises your risk for heart disease, it’s important to keep blood pressure in a healthy range. For most people, that’s less than 120/80. But ask your doctor what your numbers should be. Some monitors let you upload your readings into an app or website for easy tracking. You can also print them out to share with your doctor. The stair test. If you can’t climb four flights of stairs within 90 seconds, that may be a sign that your heart isn’t as healthy as it should be. Talk to your doctor about your concerns. Coronary Artery Disease Tests Your doctor can order many tests to get a better sense of your heart health. That can include: Blood tests. A sample of your blood can be checked for issues that raise your risk of coronary artery disease. Among them are high cholesterol, high triglycerides (a type of blood fat), and high-sensitivity CRP, a special protein that signals heart inflammation. Computed tomography (CT) coronary angiogram Sometimes, doctors want a close-up look of your arteries. If so, a special dye is put into your vein before a CT scan. Coronary calcium scan Also called a heart calcium scan or cardiac calcium scan, this test looks for calcium deposits that are blocking your arteries and making it hard for blood to get through. Echocardiogram (echo) Sound waves can be used to show how well blood flows to and from your heart. Electrocardiogram (EKG) Small painless devices called electrodes can be put on your skin to check how well your heart is working. If this test is done in your doctor’s office, it will give a snapshot of your heart health. To get more info about your heart patterns, you may be given a special device to wear for up to a week. Exercise stress test Sometimes, CAD symptoms only show up when you’re active. For this type of test, you’ll be asked to walk or run on a treadmill or pedal a stationary bike during an EKG. Cardiac catheterization If your doctor chooses to do this more complex procedure, a very thin tube called a catheter is put into one of your blood vessels and guided to your heart. Then dye is put into the tube so your doctor can see your blood vessels better and check for blockages. Coronary Artery Disease Complications Coronary artery disease can lead to other serious – and sometimes life-threatening – conditions, such as: Angina (chest pain). Over time, coronary artery disease will cause plaque to build up inside your arteries and make them more narrow. As a result, your heart might not get enough blood when it needs it, such as during exercise, and you may feel chest pain and shortness of breath. Heart failure. This is when your heart can’t pump enough blood. If you have narrowed arteries or high blood pressure, the walls of your heart might become weak or stiff, making it harder for your heart to work as well as it should. Heart attack. This is the most common complication of coronary artery disease. Heart attacks occur when a piece of cholesterol plaque breaks off and causes a blood clot that blocks blood flow to the heart. The lack of blood damages the heart muscle, and if left untreated, a heart attack can be fatal. If you have symptoms of a heart attack, call 911. Arrhythmias. If your heart isn’t getting enough blood, it may start to beat irregularly. Some types of arrhythmias can be life-threatening. Coronary Artery Disease Treatment Depending on your case, your treatment plan may include one or a combination of the following treatments: Medications You may need to take medicines to help your heart be healthier. They can include blood thinners (anticoagulants), aspirin and other anti-clotting medicines, ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, nitroglycerin, calcium channel blockers, certain immunosuppressants, statins, or PCSK9s. Invasive procedures Part of your treatment plan may involve surgery. Some of the most commonly performed procedures for coronary artery disease include: Angioplasty. This procedure can open blocked or narrowed arteries without opening up your chest. In angioplasty, a doctor threads a thin, flexible tube with a balloon through your blood vessels until it reaches the blocked artery. The doctor then inflates the balloon, which stretches the artery open so more blood can flow. In many cases, a tiny tube called a stent is also inserted to keep the blood vessel open. You’ll typically be in and out of the hospital in a day. Coronary artery bypass grafting. During this surgery, doctors use blood vessels from other parts of your body to make a detour around blockages in your coronary arteries. It’s a major operation, and you’ll probably need to be in the hospital for at least 5 days. Cardiac rehabilitation and recovery If you've had a heart attack or cardiac surgery,  your doctor will likely recommend that you complete a cardiac rehab program to help you recover. Cardiac rehab will start while you're in the hospital, then you can attend outpatient appointments once you go home. Most insurance companies will cover 12 weeks of cardiac rehab. Typically, these programs include the following: Exercise training Addressing cardiac risk factors Heart health education Nutritional guidance Emotional support Studies have shown that cardiac rehab can help lower your future risk of stroke, heart attack, depression, and cardiac-related death. Lifestyle changes These time-tested methods sound familiar for a reason -- they work! Favor foods that are low in trans fats, saturated fats, simple sugars, and sodium. If you smoke, quit. Be active, ideally for 30 minutes or more a day. (First, ask your doctor if there are any limits on what you can do.) Work to stick to a healthy weight. Learn effective ways to manage your stress. Prevention of Coronary Artery Disease Fortunately, there are a number of things you can do to reduce your chances of getting CAD. Get wise to your risk. Speak to your doctor about getting your cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood sugar checked. If you have high cholesterol, high blood pressure, or diabetes, it’s important to manage those conditions. Aim for a healthy weight . If you’re not sure what your target weight should be, ask your doctor. And if you have a lot of weight to lose, remember that even a modest amount of weight loss helps. Avoid cigarette smoke. If you smoke, quit. Steer clear of secondhand smoke. Limit your alcohol. One or two drinks may have some heart benefits, but too much is risky. Men should have no more than two alcoholic drinks a day, and women should have no more than one per day. Eat smart. Eat whole foods and avoid trans fats, which can be found in many baked goods and deep-fried and processed foods. Get plenty of fiber-rich foods, such as fruits and veggies, whole grains, and beans. Limit salt and aim to have two servings of fatty fish, such as salmon, tuna, or mackerel, a week. They’re high in heart-healthy omega-3 fats. Exercise regularly. You’ll want to get at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise (like hiking or going for a bike ride that makes your heart beat faster but not race) on 5 or more days a week. Speak with your doctor before you begin a new exercise routine. Manage your stress level. Use strategies such as exercise, meditation, and other healthy activities that relax you. Outlook With Coronary Artery Disease There is no cure for coronary artery disease. Your prognosis will depend on your age, symptoms, and other health conditions and risk factors you have. But you may be able to improve your prognosis or slow the progression of the disease by changing your lifestyle and following your doctor’s treatment plan. Take any medications your doctor prescribes to treat your coronary artery disease as consistently as possible. When Should I Call My Health Care Provider? If you have coronary artery disease, you will have regular check-ups with your doctor and any specialists they refer you to, like a cardiologist. But if you notice any changes in your symptoms or if you have side effects related to your medications between those visits, reach out to your doctor. They can also discuss any questions or concerns you have about your treatment plan. If you are having symptoms of a heart attack or stroke, call 911 right away. Both are medical emergencies that require medical attention as quickly as possible. Coronary Artery Disease Takeaways Coronary artery disease is the most common form of heart disease in the U.S. If you've been diagnosed with the condition, your doctor will help you find the treatment plan that's right for you. Coronary artery disease can lead to serious complications, including heart attack and arrhythmia, but quitting smoking, eating a low-sodium diet, and maintaining a healthy weight are steps you can take right away to help lower your risk. Always talk with your doctor if your symptoms change, and ask them before making any major changes to your exercise routine. Coronary Artery Disease FAQs What is the life expectancy of someone with coronary artery disease? The life expectancy of someone with CAD will vary, depending on their age, medical history, and lifestyle choices. If you’ve been diagnosed with coronary artery disease, talk with your doctor about your prognosis. What are the coronary arteries? There are two main coronary arteries. The left main coronary artery supplies blood to the left ventricle and left atrium, while the right coronary artery sends blood to the right ventricle, right atrium, and the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. Both sides divide into smaller branches to supply blood to all parts of the heart."
2,What Is Clubfoot?,"About one out of every 1,000 babies is born with a foot that’s twisted. It may curl sideways with the toes bent at a funny angle. Or, it might have an odd shape and point in the wrong direction, so that it appears to be crooked, or even nearly upside down. Doctors call this clubfoot. Most babies who are born with clubfoot are healthy in all other ways; about half of them have it in both feet. Clubfoot doesn’t cause pain , but if it’s not treated, it can make it hard for a child to walk without a limp. It’s easy to correct in most cases, so most children don’t have long-lasting effects. Can It Be Prevented? Clubfoot happens because the tendons (bands of tissue that connect muscles to bones) and muscles in and around the foot are shorter than they should be. Doctors don’t know what causes it, and there’s no way to ensure that your baby won’t be born with it. But some things make clubfoot more likely. They include: Gender . Two-thirds of babies with clubfoot are male. Family history . Babies with a parent or sibling who had clubfoot are twice as likely to get it. Lifestyle choices . If you smoke or use illegal drugs while you’re pregnant , you raise your baby’s chances of being born with it. Other birth defects . In some cases, it’s linked with another condition a baby is born with, such as spina bifida . Too little amniotic fluid during pregnancy . This surrounds your baby in the womb. If there’s not enough, your baby’s chances of being born with clubfoot are higher. Symptoms It’s easy to notice clubfoot when a baby is born. Here are some signs: The foot points downward, and the toes may be curled inward. The foot appears to be sideways or sometimes even upside-down. The foot may be smaller than a normal foot by up to a half-inch. The calf muscles on the affected leg may not be fully developed. The foot may have a limited range of motion. Most doctors can spot clubfoot simply by looking at your baby when they're born. If you have an ultrasound done late in your pregnancy, your doctor may notice it then. Treatment Your doctor will begin to correct your baby’s clubfoot shortly after they’re born. Babies don’t use their feet until they learn to stand and walk, so the goal is to fix it early enough to prevent delays. Your doctor will use a cast or surgery. Casting. A baby’s tendons bend and stretch very easily, so doctors are able to turn the clubfoot in the right direction to help correct the problem. They gently move the foot into a position that’s closer to where it should be. Then, they put on a cast to hold it in place. About a week later, the doctor removes the cast. They gently stretch the baby’s foot some more, puts it in a new position, and puts on a new cast. They'll continue this pattern for weeks or months. Your doctor may take X-rays to be sure the baby’s bones are slowly moving into their correct positions. If the series of casts helps to correct your baby’s clubfoot, they’ll need to wear a special brace or shoe to keep it at the right angle until after they've learned to walk. This is because a clubfoot tends to turn back to its original position. Some children may only need to wear the brace or shoe for a short time. Others may need it for a few years to make sure the foot stays at the right angle. Surgery. If the tendons and other tissues in your baby’s foot are too short, no amount of stretching and casting can do the trick. If this is the case, surgery may work. Babies who need clubfoot surgery often get it between the ages of 6 months and a year. Unlike the gradual casting process, the doctor fixes everything in one procedure. They may lengthen tendons or take other steps to turn and shape the foot to a more normal position. After surgery, your baby will need to wear a cast to keep their foot at the correct angle. Then, they’ll need a brace or a special shoe for about a year so the foot doesn’t go back to its original position."
3,Understanding Osteoporosis -- the Basics,"What to Know About Osteoporosis Osteoporosis, which means ""porous bones,"" is a condition that causes bones to gradually thin and weaken, leaving them at greater risk of fractures . About 2 million fractures in the US each year are due to osteoporosis . Although all bones can be affected by the disease, the bones of the spine, hip, and wrist are most likely to break. In older people, hip fractures can be particularly dangerous. Having to stay still for a long time during the healing process can lead to possibly deadly complications, like blood clots or pneumonia. Of the estimated 10 million Americans who have osteoporosis , at least 80% are women. Experts believe it’s because women’s bones tend to be lighter and less dense and because their bodies go through hormonal changes after menopause that speed up the loss of bone mass. What Causes Osteoporosis? When people are young, bone in their bodies is broken down and replaced continuously, a process known as bone remodeling. Bone mass usually peaks in a person's mid to late 20s. Bone loss -- where bone breakdown goes faster than bone buildup -- usually begins in the mid-30s. Bones begin to lose calcium -- the mineral that makes them hard -- faster than they can replace it. Less bone remodeling takes place, and the bones begin to thin. For women, the loss of bone density speeds up during the first 5 to 7 years after menopause and then slows down again. Scientists believe that’s because of a sharp decline in the body's production of estrogen , which appears to help keep calcium in the bones. Although some loss of bone density is a natural part of aging, you’re at higher risk for getting the very porous bones and fractures associated with osteoporosis if you: Are thin or have a small frame Smoke, drink more than moderately, or live a sedentary lifestyle Have a family history of hip fracture Had your ovaries removed, especially before age 40 Are white or Asian Certain medical conditions that increase bone breakdown, including kidney disease , Cushing's syndrome , and an overactive thyroid or parathyroid, can also lead to osteoporosis. Glucocorticoids, also known as steroids, also increase bone loss. Anti- seizure drugs and long-term immobility because of paralysis or illness can also cause bone loss. Bone Health and Your Lifestyle Habits Your everyday habits -- good and bad -- affect bone health. How do your habits stack up? Vitamin D and calcium. Not getting enough vitamin D or calcium can weaken your bones. The National Institutes of Health recommends adults up to 70 years of age should get 600 IU of vitamin D every day. Over the age of 70, they need 800 IU of vitamin D each day. Men up to age 70 and women up to age 50 need 1000 mg of calcium daily. Men over 70 and women over 50 need 1200 mg of calcium a day. Fruits and vegetables . Eating plenty of fruits and vegetables provides you with magnesium , potassium , and vitamin K -- all good things for bone health. Protein. Very high amounts of nondairy animal protein can weaken the bones. Sufficient protein is important for bone health. Ask your doctor how much protein you should have each day. Caffeine . When used in excess, caffeine can threaten bone health. Alcohol. Excess alcohol intake can decrease bone formation. If you are tipsy from the alcohol, you're more likely to fall. In older people, falls are linked with broken bones. Activity level. Physical activity can help keep bones strong. If you're not an exerciser, ask your doctor for guidance on doing weight-bearing exercises such as fast walking. Ask about lifting weights or other muscle-strengthening exercises. Both types are good for your bones. Smoking. Studies show that smoking is bad for the bones. Osteoporosis Tests and Diagnosis To make a diagnosis, your doctor will usually take a full medical history, order a bone density test , and possibly other tests. During an exam, your doctor will: Look at your age, consider whether women have reached menopause, whether you have ever broken a bone as an adult, your own family history, and your habits such as drinking, eating, and exercise . Ask about which medications you take. Some, such as corticosteroids, can weaken the bones if taken long term. Measure you to see if you’ve lost height. The doctor will inspect your spine. If it abnormally curves forward, that could be a sign that you've already had spinal fractures due to osteoporosis. A bone density test is noninvasive and measures the concentration of minerals in the bones of the hip, spine and sometimes forearm. Your doctor will compare your results to what’s normal and determine if you have low bone density, known as osteopenia , or osteoporosis. Osteoporosis Treatment Your doctor may recommend a prescription drug to help limit bone breakdown and maintain bone density and lower your risk of an osteoporotic fracture. Most of these drugs have been shown to lower risk of fractures in your hips and back. Examples of bisphosphonate drugs include: Alendronate ( Fosamax ) Alendronate sodium ( Binosto ) Ibandronate ( Boniva ) Risedronate ( Actonel , Atelvia ) Zoledronic acid ( Reclast , Zometa) Other drug options to protect against bone loss include: Raloxifene ( Evista ): an estrogen -like drug that helps increase bone density and reduces fracture risk. Romosozumab-aqqg ( Evenity) : an anti-sclerostin antibody that works to increase bone formation and reduce bone loss. Abaloparatide ( Tymlos ) and teriparatide ( Forteo ): a synthetic form of parathyroid hormone for people with osteoporosis who are considered at high risk for fracture. These medications help build bone density. Denosumab ( Prolia, Xgeva ): an antibody that prevents the formation of cells that break down bone, resulting in less bone loss. Calcitonon: a naturally occurring hormone that helps prevent fracture and may help slow bone loss. If you start taking a bone-maintenance drug, be sure your doctor knows about all other medicines you’re on. Some drugs can affect the bones, and your doctor may want to switch you to another drug or adjust the dose. If you’re taking a bisphosphonate, you may be switched to another drug after 5 years. There’s a low risk of getting a thigh bone fracture if you use them long term. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) -- either estrogen alone or a combination of estrogen and progestin -- can prevent and treat osteoporosis. However, research has shown that hormone replacement therapy increases the risk of breast cancer , heart disease, and stroke in some women. So HRT isn't generally recommended for initial treatment of osteoporosis in most women, because the health risks are thought to outweigh the benefits. In women who have been on menopausal hormone therapy in the past and then stopped taking it, the bones begin to thin again -- at the same pace as during menopause. What to Expect After a Fracture Fractures from osteoporosis often happen at the hip, wrist, and spine. Hip fractures often require surgery. Wrist fractures may need casting or surgery. Spine and fractures are the most common in seniors. Weak bones can lead to a compression fracture in the vertebrae, the bones that form your spine. Over time, compression fractures can change the strength and shape of your spine. You may lose height or have chronic back pain. In some people, the pain can be severe and can lead to other health problems. Pain Relief Options for Fractures Pain medicine and other therapies can help. Options include: Aspirin or acetaminophen ( Actamin , Anacin AF, Tylenol ). Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines. Examples are ibuprofen ( Advil , Motrin , Nuprin ) and naproxen ( Aleve , Anaprox , Naprelan , Naprosyn ). Both can reduce pain and swelling. If you need a stronger painkiller, your doctor can prescribe opioid pain medicines, such as codeine or morphine . However, doctors may discourage you from staying on these potent medicines. Physical therapy can help you learn how to move properly, lowering the risk for more fractures. Two surgical procedures, both minimally invasive, can be done for fracture-related back pain: Kyphoplasty involves inserting a balloon to expand the fractured vertebrae. The space created by the balloon is then filled with bone cement. The balloon is withdrawn. Vertebroplasty involves injection of the cement, but without the use of the balloon. When considering these procedures, discuss the benefits and risks with your doctor. They can have serious risks, such as the cement leaking, and other side effects, like tissue damage, blood clots in the lung, and respiratory failure. Complications of Osteoporosis Bone Fractures Fractures due to osteoporosis can interfere with daily activities such as bending, walking downstairs, or cooking. Prompt treatment, physical therapy, and your commitment to a healthy lifestyle can improve your well-being"
4,"Blisters, Corns, Calluses, and Your Skin","Three of the more common skin conditions that people experience are blisters , corns, and calluses . Blisters : A blister is a bubble on the skin surface ranging from pinpoint size to more than an inch in diameter that often contains a clear liquid, although it may also contain blood or pus. They are different from pustules, which contain thicker, yellow-white material called pus. Blisters can form when the skin is repeatedly rubbed; for instance, when your shoes rub the same spot on your foot, when you wear shoes that don't fit properly, or when you wear shoes without socks. Depending on the cause, blistering may happen along with pain, redness, or itching. Corn: A corn is a build-up of hard skin near a bony area of a toe or between toes. Corns may be caused by pressure from shoes that rub against the toes or cause friction between the toes. Callus: A callus is a build-up of hard skin, usually on the underside of the foot. Calluses are caused by an uneven distribution of weight, generally on the bottom of the forefoot or heel. Calluses also can be caused by improperly fitting shoes or by a skin abnormality. It's normal to have some calluses on the soles of your feet. How Are These Skin Conditions Treated? Blisters The skin covering the blister helps protect it from infection. Draining a blister is not recommended because of the risk of infection, but under certain conditions, your doctor may recommend you ""pop"" the blister with a sterile needle to allow the skin to re-attach. However, don't cut the skin away unless it is already torn and drying out. Keep the blister clean. Gently wash the area with mild soap and water or a cleansing towel and then apply antibacterial ointment to the blister. Cover it with a telfa pad and secure it with hypoallergenic paper tape to help protect the skin and prevent infection. You can also use a waterproof adhesive bandage. Change the dressing at least once a day and wear different shoes until the blister heals. Keep the wound covered with antibacterial ointment and a bandage until it is healed. Corns Don't try to cut the corn or remove it with a sharp object. After you take a bath or shower, while your skin is still soft, use a pumice stone or an emery board to smooth and gently remove the build-up of tissue. Move the emery board or pumice stone in one direction only. You can also use cushioned or medicated pads. Calluses Don't try to cut the callus or remove it with a sharp object. After your bath or shower, use a pumice stone to gently remove the build-up of tissue. You can use cushioned pads, donut pads, and insoles to keep the pressure off the callus area. Your health care provider may prescribe medications to soften the calluses. How Can These Skin Conditions Be Prevented? To prevent blisters, corns, or calluses on the skin: Wear shoes that fit properly and comfortably Wear socks with shoes Use foot powder to help keep your feet dry Wear gloves when you are doing manual labor or working with your hands"
5,Campylobacter Infection,"What Is Campylobacteriosis? Campylobacteriosis is an infection caused by bacteria you can get from contaminated food and water. It causes diarrhea. You might also hear it called campylobacter, campylobacter infection, or campylobacteriosis gastroenteritis. When people worry about eating undercooked chicken, they usually focus on getting sick from salmonella bacteria. But another common type of bacteria called campylobacter can also make you ill if you eat poultry that isn’t fully cooked. Like a salmonella infection, campylobacteriosis can cause diarrhea and sometimes other serious complications. Infants and children have a greater chance than adults for campylobacter infection, but it can strike anyone at any age. Men are also more likely than women to get infected. It’s more common in summer than winter. About 1.3 million people are infected in the United States every year. That doesn’t include the many people who never report their symptoms or get officially diagnosed. Campylobacteriosis Symptoms The infection usually lasts about a week. If you’ve been infected, symptoms start within a couple of days of eating the infected food. They may include: Diarrhea, sometimes bloody Nausea Vomiting Belly cramps Bloating Fever Some people never have symptoms. When to Call a Doctor If your immune system is weakened by HIV or by medications to treat cancer , the bacteria can cause a serious infection in your bloodstream. See your doctor soon after diarrhea and other symptoms appear. If you’re generally in good health and you get a bout of diarrhea, you may wait a couple of days. Treat it as you would any illness that causes diarrhea. If you feel seriously ill, then see your doctor sooner. Symptoms to watch for include: Diarrhea for more than 2 days Blood in your stool Signs of dehydration (dark pee, dry mouth and skin , dizziness ) Severe pain in your gut or rectum Fever of 102 F or higher Can’t drink fluids due to nausea or vomiting Campylobacteriosis Causes Campylobacter bacteria can get into your system if you eat undercooked poultry or food that has touched raw or undercooked poultry. The bacteria usually live in the digestive systems of animals, including poultry and cattle. You can also find campylobacter bacteria in unpasteurized milk Campylobacteriosis usually develops in isolated cases. Sometimes, though, there can be an outbreak when several people have the same infection. In developing countries, the bacteria live in water and sewage systems. How does campylobacteriosis contamination happen? Poultry and cattle can carry campylobacter even if they have no symptoms. When the animals are slaughtered, bacteria can spread from the intestines to the parts people eat. Infection in a cow’s udder or contact with manure can contaminate milk. Pasteurized milk is safe to drink. Animal waste can get into lakes and streams. The contaminated water can spread bacteria to fruits and vegetables. Washing produce with clean water helps make it safe. Campylobacteria Diagnosis and Tests Diarrhea and vomiting are common campylobacteriosis symptoms, but they can be signs of many illnesses. This is true for bloody stools , too. To make a diagnosis, your doctor may ask for a stool sample, which they’ll send to a lab. Your doctor’s office will give you a special container in which to collect the sample. It can take several days to get the results. In rare cases, a doctor may order a blood test, but these results take even longer -- up to 2 weeks. Campylobacteriosis Treatment Most people get over the infection without medicine or special treatments. Drink lots of fluids while you have diarrhea. Unless your doctor tells you otherwise, don’t take anything to prevent vomiting and diarrhea. That’s your body’s way of getting rid of the infection. Campylobacteriosis medications If your immune system is weak, your doctor might prescribe medicine to fight the infection: Azithromycin ( Zithromax , Zmax ) is usually the first antibiotic your doctor will try. Ciprofloxacin (Cetraxal, Ciloxan, Cipro ) or levofloxacin ( Levaquin ) are other options. Antibiotic resistance and campylobacteriosis You might hear the term antibiotic resistance when people talk about campylobacter. Infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria (that means they no longer respond to some of the drugs used to treat them) can be harder to treat, can last longer, and can cause more severe illness. Campylobacteriosis Complications Usually, the infection clears up within 2-10 days. If left untreated, campylobacteriosis may lead to serious consequences for a very small number of people. Some problems can happen early on. One example is a gallbladder infection ( cholecystitis ). There can also be complications from the later stages of the infection. But serious long-term problems are unusual. The infection is associated with arthritis in rare cases. It may also lead to Guillain -Barre syndrome. It’s a disorder in which your immune system attacks nerves in your body. You can be partially paralyzed and be in the hospital for weeks. Campylobacteriosis Prevention The best way to avoid campylobacteriosis is to cook poultry to at least 165 F. The meat should be white, not pink. Never eat chicken that looks undercooked. Heating foods and pasteurizing dairy products are the only ways of knocking out the bacteria in foods that have been contaminated. You can also: Wash your hands before cooking and after touching raw poultry or meat. Keep uncooked meat and poultry away from other foods, such as vegetables, by using separate cutting boards, utensils, and cooking surfaces. Wash your hands after touching a pet or pet poop. Make sure your child or anyone with diarrhea washes their hands well. What About Work or School? To help reduce the spread of campylobacteriosis, try to avoid school or work or any public places until your stool is firm. If you still have diarrhea, stay home and try to stay hydrated. A relapse is possible, but not likely."
6,What Is Leukodystrophy?,"Leukodystrophy isn’t just one disease; it’s actually a group of diseases that affect the central nervous system. Doctors are discovering new forms of leukodystrophy all the time, but experts currently know of about 52 different kinds. Most of the leukodystrophies are genetic, meaning they’re passed down from parent to child. Sometimes symptoms will show up early in childhood. But because the diseases are progressive, meaning they get worse over time, some children born with a form of leukodystrophy may seem fine. Symptoms The one thing all leukodystrophies have in common is they cause abnormal development or destruction of the brain’s myelin sheath. That’s the white fatty matter that protects the brain’s nerves. Without it, your nervous system can’t function properly. But each leukodystrophy affects myelin differently. That means children can have many problems, including: Balance and mobility problems Behavioral and learning disabilities Bladder issues Breathing difficulties Developmental delays Hearing, speech, and vision problems Muscle control disorders Seizures For example, one type of leukodystrophy, Canavan disease, causes decreased muscle tone, especially in the neck, and abnormally straight legs and flexed arms. It can also include symptoms like blindness and seizures. Sometimes symptoms show up soon after a child is born, and sometimes as late as adulthood. Signs of Refsum Disease, for example, usually occur around age 20, but can be as late as age 50. Some of the common symptoms include degeneration of the retina in the eye, deafness, and loss of sense of smell. While every leukodystrophy is different, the most common problem is a child’s health gradually worsening in some way, even though they seemed fine to start with. This can be a worsening of their vision, hearing, speech, ability to eat, behavior, or thought. Since symptoms can vary so much, leukodystrophy can be hard to diagnose. Causes Most of the leukodystrophies are inherited, which means they’re passed down through family genes. Some may not be inherited, but are still caused by a genetic mutation. One child in your family could have leukodystrophy, and others might not. For example, Alexander disease doesn’t seem to be genetically inherited, so your child can have a defective gene even if neither you nor your partner have it. If you have a child with leukodystrophy and you’re planning to have more children, you may want to consider genetic counseling. It can help you understand your chances of having another child with leukodystrophy. Diagnosis Diagnosing leukodystrophy can be difficult. Oftentimes, doctors have to use several types of testing, including: Blood and urine analysis CT scans Genetic testing MRI scans Psychological and cognitive tests Treatment There is no cure for most kinds of leukodystrophy. Treating it depends on the type, and doctors address the symptoms of the disease with medications and special kinds of physical, occupational, and speech therapy. Some people may need additional help with learning or nutrition. In some cases, a bone marrow transplant can help by slowing or stopping the progression of the disease. Scientists are also researching whether gene therapy or replacing certain enzymes can help treat some kinds of leukodystrophy."
7,Tongue Cancer: Facts That You Need to Know,"What Is Tongue Cancer? This is one of the several kinds of oral ( mouth ) cancers. Like other cancers, it happens when cells divide out of control and form a growth or tumor. There are two types. One is called oral tongue cancer because it affects the part you can stick out. The other happens at the base of your tongue , where it connects to your throat. This type, called oropharyngeal cancer, is often diagnosed after it has spread to the lymph nodes in your neck. Tongue cancer is less common than many other types. Most people who get it are older adults. It's rare in children. Tongue Cancer Symptoms One of the first signs of tongue cancer is a white or red patch, lump, or sore on the side of your tongue that doesn't go away. You may also have: Pain in or near your tongue Changes in your voice, like sounding hoarse Trouble swallowing or chewing or with moving your jaw or tongue Numbness of the tongue or mouth Jaw swelling Constant sore throat A feeling like something is caught in your throat Swollen lymph nodes in your neck Coughing up blood Weight loss Ear pain Bleeding in your mouth A lump in the back of your mouth, throat, or neck If you have a sore on your tongue or in your mouth that doesn't get better in a couple of weeks, see your doctor. If the problem is at the base of your tongue, you may not notice any symptoms. Your dentist may find signs of tongue cancer during a checkup, or your doctor might notice something during a regular exam. Causes of Tongue Cancer The human papillomavirus ( HPV ) can cause cancers on the base of the tongue. HPV also can infect your genital area and cause cervical cancer , penile cancer, and anal cancer. HPV infection is the most common sexually transmitted infection. There are many types of HPV . The ones that raise your odds of getting cancer are called high-risk HPVs. Other things that may raise your chances of getting tongue cancer include: Tobacco use Alcohol use Jagged teeth Not taking care of your teeth and gums Chewing betel, common in South and Southeast Asia A personal history of certain cancers A poor diet Your genes also may play a role in whether you're likely to get tongue cancer . Tongue cancer is more common in men and people assigned male at birth than in women and people assigned female at birth. You're also more likely to get the illness if you're 45 or older and have a weakened immune system. Diagnosis of Tongue Cancer Your doctor will examine your mouth and ask questions about your symptoms. Then, they may suggest testing to diagnose tongue cancer, including: Imaging tests. These tests, such as X-rays, CT , MRI, and PET scans, capture detailed pictures of your mouth, including where the cancer is located and its size. You could also need a barium swallow, a type of X-ray where you drink a liquid called barium. It makes the signs of cancer more visible on X-rays. Biopsy. Your doctor may also take a sample of tissue from your mouth to test (a biopsy ). They could use different techniques to get the sample, including: Brush biopsy. In this method, doctors use a stiff brush to gather cells from your tongue, moving the brush in a circular motion. Incisional biopsy. This is where a doctor makes a small elliptical-shaped cut on your tongue to remove tissue samples. Endoscopy. During this test, your doctor will insert a thin tube fitted with a light and camera into your nose and down your throat, where they'll look for signs of cancer. An endoscopy can also show if cancer has spread to other areas of your throat. Tongue cancer staging Diagnosis also helps your doctor figure out the stage of your tongue cancer, meaning how large the tumor is and whether it has spread. Understanding your cancer stage also offers details about: How serious your cancer is Your survival chances Which treatment will work best for you Clinical trials Doctors use different staging systems, but TNM is the one they use the most for cancer reporting. In this system: ""T"" describes the size and scope of the main tumor called the primary tumor ""N"" describes how many of your lymph nodes have cancer ""M"" describes whether your cancer has spread to other parts of your body (metastasized) The TNM system also uses a series of numbers after each letter to provide even more information about the cancer, like the size of the main tumor. Treatment of Tongue Cancer Your treatment will depend on where your tumor is and how big it is. Surgery. During this operation, called a glossectomy, a surgeon takes out all or a portion of your tongue, depending on how large the cancer is. They'll also remove some healthy cells surrounding your tongue. If it looks like the cancer has spread to your lymph nodes, the surgeon could take out some of this tissue (called a neck dissection). After surgery, you may need physical therapy and rehab for speaking and swallowing problems. Reconstructive surgery. Doctors use this type of surgery to restore parts of your face or mouth that need to be removed during a cancer operation. They'll take healthy bone or tissue from other parts of your body and use it to replace parts of the tongue, lip, face, and other areas. Radiation therapy. This treatment directs strong energy beams from X-rays, protons, or other means at specific places on your body to kill cancer cells. Chemotherapy. With this treatment, you'll take medicine before or after cancer surgery to control cancer cell growth or kill lingering cells. Targeted therapy. Targeted therapy kills cancer cells by attacking specific chemicals within them. Doctors may use it to treat tongue cancer that has returned or spread beyond the tumor. Immunotherapy. If you have advanced tongue cancer and other treatments aren't working, your doctor could suggest immunotherapy. It works by helping your immune system to locate and kill cancer cells. You may also want to consider a clinical trial for tongue cancer, where you'll have the chance to try a new treatment. Talk to your health care team if you're interested in joining a clinical trial. After any treatment, you'll need regular checkups to make sure the cancer hasn't come back. Is cancer of the tongue curable? The earlier a doctor diagnoses your tongue cancer, the more likely you are to have a successful treatment. The 5-year relative survival rate for tongue cancer is 69.7%. This number represents how many people with tongue cancer are alive at the end of 5 years. Complications of Tongue Cancer Treatment Treatment of tongue cancer can cause other health problems. Here's a look at some of them: Surgery complications Bleeding Infection An abnormal passageway that forms between your mouth and the skin on your face Speech problems Trouble swallowing Pain when swallowing Radiation complications Inflammation of the mucous membranes that line your mouth and gastrointestinal tract Skin damage Bacterial skin infection ( cellulitis) Changes in your sense of taste Dry mouth Fibrosis Nerve damage to your mouth Bone death in your lower jaw Underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) Chemo complications Infection Inflamed mucous membranes in your mouth Issues with your salivary glands Changes in your sense of taste Pain Fluid loss (dehydration) Malnutrition Tongue Cancer Prevention We know that many cases of base-of-the-tongue cancer are caused by HPV. Some things that may make you less likely to get this type of cancer are: Get vaccinated for HPV, depending on your age. Speak to your doctor about your options. If you are sexually active, use latex condoms every time you have sex. Don't use tobacco in any form. Don't chew betel. Avoid heavy or frequent alcohol use. Take good care of your teeth and gums. Takeaways Facing a serious illness like tongue cancer can be worrying, but there are ways to cope. Ask your doctor questions about your cancer and treatment options and look for reliable sources of information. Stay connected with friends and family, involve them in your life, and accept their offers of help. Finally, find someone to talk to, like a counselor or support group, who can provide valuable support during this challenging time."
8,Pain Management: Cancer Pain,"It’s important to start cancer pain treatment as early as possible to get the most benefit. The majority of people with cancer will experience pain at some time or another. The pain can result from the cancer itself, or from the cancer 's treatment. In addition, some people who have been cured of their cancer can continue to suffer from pain. Cancer pain, or the discomfort that stems from cancer and its treatment, can be controlled most of the time. There are many different medicines and methods available to control cancer pain. People who have cancer and are feeling pain need to inform their doctor immediately. The earlier pain treatment is started, the more effective it may be. What Causes Cancer Pain? There are many causes of cancer pain, but often cancer pain occurs when a tumor presses on nerves or body organs or when cancer cells invade bones or body organs. Cancer treatments such as chemotherapy , radiation , or surgery also may cause pain . What Are the Symptoms of Cancer Pain? The symptoms of cancer pain vary from person to person. The amount of pain may depend on the type of cancer, the stage or extent of the disease, and the person's pain threshold (tolerance for pain). Pain can range from mild and occasional to severe and constant. What Medicines Are Used To Treat Cancer Pain? Mild to Moderate Pain Pain relievers: Acetaminophen ( Anacin , Mapap , Panadol , Tylenol ) and a group of pain relievers called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) such as aspirin and ibuprofen ( Advil, Motrin ) can treat mild to moderate pain. Many of these are over-the-counter drugs that do not require a prescription, but some do require a prescription. Patients should check with a doctor before using these medicines, especially if they are getting chemotherapy. NSAIDs can interfere with blood clotting, cause gastrointestinal and kidney problems, and may lead to an increased risk of heart attack or stroke. Moderate to Severe Pain Narcotic pain relievers: These drugs include codeine , morphine ( Kadian , MS Contin ), hydrocodone ( Hysingla , Lortab , Norco , Vicodin , Zohydro ER ), hydromorphone ( Dilaudid , Exalgo ), fentanyl ( Duragesic ), oxycodone ( OxyContin ), and tramadol . Narcotic pain relievers require a prescription and may be used along with mild pain relievers for moderate to severe pain. Tingling and Burning Pain Antidepressants : Certain antidepressants are used to relieve pain even if the person isn't depressed. Amitriptyline and nortriptyline ( Aventyl , Pamelor ), and duloxetine ( Cymbalta ) are antidepressants sometimes used to treat pain. Anticonvulsants (anti-seizure medications ): Despite the name, anticonvulsants like gabapentin ( Horizant , Neurontin ) and carbamazepine ( Carbatrol , Equetro , Tegretol ) are used not only for seizures , but also to control burning and tingling pain, painful symptoms of nerve damage . Other drugs: Corticosteroids such as prednisone ( Sterapred ) are used to lessen swelling, which often causes pain. How Else Can Cancer Pain Be Treated? Although cancer pain is usually treated with medicine, surgery to remove a tumor or radiation therapy to shrink a tumor can be used along with medicine to provide additional pain relief. In most cases, doctors treat cancer pain with pain-relief medicines called analgesics or with non-drug treatments such as physical therapy and rehabilitation, imagery, biofeedback and relaxation techniques. Other treatment options for cancer patients may include nerve blocks, which involve the injection of pain medicine into or around a nerve or the spine."
9,"Leptospirosis: Symptoms, Causes, and Treatment","What Is Leptospirosis? Leptospirosis can cause a range of flu-like symptoms, from vomiting to diarrhea. Learn what causes the rare infection and how to avoid it. (Photo Credit: iStock/Getty Images) Leptospirosis is a rare bacterial infection we get from animals. It’s spread through their urine , especially from dogs, rodents, and farm animals. They may not have any symptoms, but they can be carriers. In most cases, leptospirosis is unpleasant but not life-threatening, like a case of the flu . It rarely lasts more than a week. But about 10% of the time, when you have a severe form of leptospirosis, you’ll get better, but then get sick again. This is called Weil’s disease, and it can cause much more serious issues, like chest pain and swollen arms and legs. It often means a trip to the hospital. Leptospirosis Causes A bacteria called Leptospira interrogans causes leptospirosis. Many animals carry the organism, and it lives in their kidneys . It gets into soil and water from their urine. If you’re around soil or water where an infected animal has peed, the germ can invade your body through breaks in your skin , like scratches, open wounds, or dry areas. It can also enter through your nose, mouth , or genitals. It’s hard to get it from another person, though it can be passed through sex or breastfeeding . You have a higher chance of getting the disease if you spend a lot of time around animals or outdoors. You’re more likely to be exposed to it if you have one of these jobs: Farmer Veterinarian Underground worker (you work in a sewer or a mine) Slaughterhouse worker Military personnel Also, if you raft, swim, or camp near affected lakes and rivers, you could get the disease. You'll find leptospirosis more often in warm climates. And although the bacteria lives all over the world, it’s especially common in Australia, Africa, Southeast Asia, Central and South America, and the Caribbean. Leptospirosis Phases There are two phases of leptospirosis: Leptospiremic phase. During this phase, you'll suddenly have symptoms that feel a lot like the flu. They'll start a couple of days to a couple of weeks after you're first exposed to the leptospira bacteria. Symptoms can last for up to 10 days. Immune phase . Once you reach this phase, the leptospira bacteria is now in your organs, especially your kidneys. The bacteria will show up in urine tests, and your body will build up protection (antibodies) against the bacteria. It's possible that you could get sick during this phase with another illness called Weil's syndrome, which causes internal bleeding, kidney damage, and jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes). Leptospirosis Symptoms You usually start showing signs of leptospirosis within 2 weeks, though in some cases, symptoms may not show up for a month or not at all. When the disease does hit, it hits fast. You’ll get a fever . It may spike to 104 F. Other typical symptoms include: Headache Muscle ache Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes ) Vomiting Diarrhea Skin rash Many of these symptoms are similar to symptoms of other diseases, including the flu and meningitis , so it’s important to get tested. Leptospirosis Diagnosis To check for leptospirosis, your doctor does a simple blood test and examines your blood for antibodies . These are proteins your body produces to fight the bacteria. If you've had the disease in your system before, the blood test may give a false positive (or show antibodies from the previous infection). So your doctor will likely do a second test about a week later to make sure the results are correct. You may also have a urine test to look for signs of the bacteria. Your doctor could order a DNA test . It’s more precise, but it's more expensive and takes longer, and in many areas of the world, it’s not available yet. Doctors can also spot the bacteria if it grows in a blood, spinal fluid, or urine culture. Severe symptoms of leptospirosis may need a chest X-ray, CT scan, or other imaging. These tests will help show damage to your organs caused by the bacteria. Leptospirosis Treatment Doctors can treat leptospirosis with antibiotics, including penicillin and doxycycline. Your doctor may also suggest ibuprofen for fever and muscle pain. The disease should run its course in about a week. But you may have to go to the hospital if your infection is more serious. Symptoms may include kidney failure, meningitis, and lung problems. You may need a shot of antibiotics, and in very serious cases, the infection could damage your organs. You could also need treatment for other health problems. For example, the disease can spread through your body (systemic inflammatory syndrome) and cause internal bleeding and inflame your pancreas or gallbladder. You or those around you might notice changes in your speech or behavior after the spread of this infection. It also could inflame your heart muscle (myocarditis), leading to symptoms of heart failure, including blockages and an irregular heartbeat (dysrhythmia). Your doctor will consider your other symptoms, overall health, health history, age, and other things before deciding how to treat these health problems. Leptospirosis Prevention Avoid unsafe water. If you’re in a developing country, don’t drink the water unless you’re sure it’s clean. But because leptospirosis can enter through other body openings, it’s also a good idea to avoid swimming, waterskiing, sailing, or fishing in freshwater areas. Saltwater is generally safe. Keep away from infected animals, especially wild rats. Rats and other rodents are the main carriers of the bacteria. Be careful if you have to handle wild rats or come in contact with their habitats. In the developed world, farm animals are usually vaccinated, so there’s much less risk. If an animal is ill, avoid bites and body fluids. The disease can’t be passed through the air like a cold or the flu. Be aware of your surroundings, especially when you travel. In countries with poor sanitation, leptospirosis is more common and may be hard to avoid. So, know the symptoms and get help if you become ill. Use disinfectant. Bleach, Lysol, acid solutions, and iodine are deadly to the bacteria. Keep them on hand to clean up. Leptospirosis in Dogs All animals can get leptospirosis. Though it used to be rare in pets, it has shown up more often in the past few years, especially in dogs. (Leptospirosis is rare in cats.) Leptospirosis in dogs happens the same way it does in people: through contact with the urine of infected animals, which can get into water or soil and survive for weeks or months. Your pet might not show any symptoms. Many of the symptoms of leptospirosis are very similar to those of other diseases, such as: Fever Belly pain, vomiting, diarrhea Weakness Pain Stiffness The only way to know for sure they have it is to ask your vet to do a test. And of course, if your pet is infected, they can pass it on to you. There is a leptospirosis vaccine available for dogs. Veterinarians recommend that any dog that goes outside at all – even just to go to the bathroom – be vaccinated against leptospirosis."
10,Canker Sore (Aphthous Ulcer),"What Is a Canker Sore? A canker sore is a small, shallow open wound (or ulcer ) in your mouth that can make eating and talking uncomfortable. They’re also known as aphthous ulcers. There are a few types of canker sores : Minor canker sores. These may show up three or four times a year. They typically happen in people ages 10 to 20. They’re less than 1 centimeter across and heal in about a week with no scarring. Major canker sores. These are less common. The ulcers are bigger and can last more than 2 weeks. They often heal with scarring. Herpetiform canker sores. These are rare and show up as clusters of tiny ulcers. They usually heal in about a week. Canker Sore Causes and Risk Factors Doctors don’t know what exactly causes most canker sores. Things that might cause minor sores include: Stress Tissue injury, like from a sharp tooth or a dental appliance Certain foods, including citrus or acidic fruits and vegetables (such as lemons, oranges, pineapples, apples, figs, tomatoes, and strawberries) Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen An allergy to something in your food or in your toothpaste or mouthwash Helicobacter pylori , the bacteria that can cause peptic ulcers Things that might cause complex canker sores include: An underlying health condition like a weakened immune system, HIV/AIDS, lupus, or Behcet’s disease Nutritional problems like too little vitamin B12, zinc, folic acid , or iron Gastrointestinal diseases like celiac or Crohn’s About 1 in 5 people gets canker sores regularly. They’re more common in women, possibly because of hormonal differences. They may also run in families. Canker Sore vs. Cold Sore Canker and cold sores aren’t the same. Cold sores , also called fever blisters or herpes simplex type 1, are groups of painful, fluid-filled blisters . Unlike canker sores, a virus causes cold sores , and they’re highly contagious. Also, cold sores typically appear outside your mouth -- usually under your nose, around your lips, or under your chin -- but canker sores show up inside your mouth. Canker Sore Symptoms You may have a canker sore if you have: A tingling or burning sensation, often 6 to 24 hours before a canker sore Small sores in your mouth that are round or oval, white, gray, or pale yellow with a red edge or border A painful sore or sores that appear alone or in clusters inside your mouth: on your tongue , at the base of the gums, on your soft palate (the back portion of the roof of your mouth), or inside your cheeks Severe canker sore attacks may also cause: Fever Fatigue Swollen lymph nodes Canker Sore Diagnosis Canker sores usually aren’t serious. Call your dentist if you have: Unusually large sores Sores that spread Sores that last 3 weeks or longer Extreme pain despite avoiding trigger foods and taking over-the-counter pain medication Trouble drinking enough fluids A high fever with canker sores Frequent or lasting mouth sores, which may be a sign of an underlying problem, such as a serious skin disorder called pemphigus , celiac disease , inflammatory bowel disease , Behcet's disease, autoimmune disease , anemia , HIV , or, in rare cases, oral cancer or leukemia They can usually make a diagnosis based on a physical exam and your medical history. They might want to test your blood to see whether a vitamin deficiency or another health condition is causing the sores. Canker Sore Treatment Pain from a canker sore tends to get better in a few days, and the sores usually heal without treatment in about a week or two. Treatment for large, long-lasting, or unusually painful sores might include: Mouthwashes. Your doctor can prescribe a rinse that has a steroid or a painkiller. Topical medications. Your doctor may prescribe a topical medication containing a steroid for the inflammation and a topical analgesic like lidocaine to relieve pain. Triamcinolone acetonide or clobetasol are often used to reduce pain and inflammation from canker sores. Oral medications. The ulcer drug sucralfate (Carafate) and the gout drug colchicine (Mitigare) can also treat canker sores. Or your doctor might give you steroid pills. Nutritional supplements. You might need these if a nutrient deficiency is causing your canker sores. Cautery. Dental lasers can help you feel better right away. Your doctor can also cauterize sores with chemicals like debacterol or silver nitrate. Canker Sore Home Remedies Home treatments to speed healing and help you feel better include: Topical products. Medicated gels, creams, pastes, and liquids go on the sore. Mouth rinses. Mix salt or baking soda in warm water, and swish it around your mouth. Milk of magnesia. Put a bit on a cotton swab, and dab it on the sore. Canker Sore Prevention There’s no cure for canker sores, and they often come back. But you might get them less often if you: Avoid foods that irritate your mouth, including citrus fruits, acidic vegetables, and spicy foods. Don’t chew gum. Brush your teeth with a soft-bristled brush after meals, and floss daily, which will keep your mouth free of foods that might trigger a sore."
11,What Is Capsaicin?,"You might not be familiar with the name, but you probably know the taste. Capsaicin is the stuff in chili peppers that makes your mouth feel hot. But it's also got a medical purpose. It's a key ingredient in creams and patches that can give you relief from pain . Why Should You Use It? When you put capsaicin on your skin , you help block pain messages to your nerves. Studies show capsaicin creams and patches can help relieve pain that's due to: Joint conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis Fibromyalgia Muscle sprains and strains Migraines and other severe headaches Surgery Some research suggests it may help improve scaling, inflammation , redness, and pain from psoriasis . It may also help relieve pain from nerve damage that's due to: Shingles Postherpetic neuralgia HIV Peripheral diabetic neuropathy How Is Capsaicin Used? Capsaicin comes in two main forms: Capsaicin cream. For most types of pain relief, your doctor may suggest you try capsaicin cream, lotion, ointment, gel, stick, film, or ointment. You usually don't need a prescription. To treat headaches , you'll dab a bit inside your nostrils. Otherwise you'll rub it thoroughly onto your skin in the area where you hurt, several times a day. Wash your hands before and after you use it, and keep it away from your eyes and mouth . Capsaicin patches. They have higher levels of capsaicin than creams. Your doctor may suggest it for postherpetic neuralgia or other long-term conditions like diabetic neuropathy . You can only get the capsaicin patch at a doctor's office. They'll numb the area before applying it. Expect the process to take around 2 hours. The capsaicin patch may help relieve pain for up to 3 months. Avoid touching the patch while it's on your skin. Side Effects of Capsaicin Both creams and patches can irritate your skin and cause problems like: Redness and swelling Soreness Dryness Burning and itching Pain This sometimes gets worse in hot and humid weather, when you bathe in warm water , and when you sweat. It usually lasts for just a few days but can continue for 2 to 4 weeks. Capsaicin can also make your skin more sensitive to the sun and heat, so use sunscreen every time you head outdoors. Like any drug, it can cause an allergic reaction in some people. Call you doctor if you get itching, hives , swelling in your throat, chest tightness, and trouble breathing The patch can also cause rare side effects that affect your heart , including a slow or fast heart rate and a change in blood pressure . Let your doctor know if you have a history of heart or blood vessel problems or high blood pressure ."
12,Baby Safety,"Your child's safety is your responsibility. The following tips should help you keep your baby out of harm's way from birth through their toddler years. Baby Safety in the Car Always use a federally approved car safety seat when traveling in a motor vehicle. Carefully read safety seat instructions, as well as instructions in your car's owner's manual, to ensure that the seat has been properly installed. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends buying a new car seat unless you’re sure a used seat has never been in an accident. NEVER carry your infant in your lap while you ride in a car. For the first 2 years of a baby's life, car seats should face the rear of the vehicle. The safest location for the car seat is the middle of the back seat. NEVER put the baby in the front passenger seat of cars, especially those with airbags. If you have a truck with no back seat, you should disengage the airbag while the baby's seat is in the car. Check the height and weight limits on your child’s car seat from time to time to be sure they haven’t outgrown it. You’ll also need to adjust the position of the harness straps as your baby gets bigger. If you have questions about safety seats, call the Auto Safety Hotline at 888-327-4236 (888-DASH-2-DOT). Or visit an NHTSA car seat inspection station . Often, they're located at fire stations. A certified technician will show you how to properly install and use your car seat. To minimize the risk that a child will accidentally be left behind in a car or get trapped inside: Leave a purse, briefcase, shoe, or cell phone in the back seat. That way, you get in the habit of checking in the back seat before leaving the vehicle. Make an arrangement with your child’s day care to have them call you if the child doesn’t show up as expected. Always lock your car and car trunk, even if the car is parked in the driveway at home, and always keep keys out of the reach of little ones. Preventing Baby Falls If you use an infant carrier, always place it on the floor, never on a counter or tabletop. Make sure the baby is always strapped in. Never leave your baby alone on a bed, couch, changing table, or infant seat from which they can fall or roll off. Even if looking away for a second, an accident can happen. Baby Safety, Smoking and Fire Safety Do not smoke and do not allow smoking around your baby. Even smoking “outside” is harmful for the baby because clothing, hair and skin still carry smoke particles. Install a working smoke alarm on every level of your home. Change the batteries of your smoke detectors every 6 months. Have at least one fire extinguisher on every level of your home. If your home uses gas heat, install a carbon monoxide detector. Preventing Baby Burns Do not hold hot liquids while holding your baby. To prevent burns, do not microwave your baby's bottle. Many microwaves heat unevenly, creating ""hot spots"" in your baby's formula that can burn your baby's mouth. Instead, warm the formula by running warm tap water over the bottle or submerging the bottle in a bowl of warm water. Shake the bottle well. Make sure you test the temperature on your hand or wrist before feeding it to your baby. Keep your hot water heater's thermostat at no higher than 120 degrees F. Consider installing anti-scald devices on faucets and shower heads. Preventing Baby Accidents Keep sharp objects (knives, scissors, tools, razors) and other hazardous items (coins, glass objects, beads, pins, medications ) in a secure place out of your baby's reach. NEVER shake a baby or throw your baby in the air. This can cause brain damage or blindness. Do not leave your baby alone with a young sibling or a pet, even when your baby is sleeping. Never put your child in a walker. They send thousands of kids to the emergency room every year, mainly by causing falls down stairs. Make sure that your baby cannot pull lamps or other electrical objects on top of themselves. Use electrical tape to secure electrical cords along baseboards. Remove tablecloths that can be pulled from the table. Make sure all drawers have stops so that your baby or toddler can't pull the drawer out on top of themselves. Attach furniture to the wall so the pieces don’t fall over the child. Avoid electronics on top of higher dressers or tables that can fall on the child. Baby Bathing Safety Always test the bath water to make sure it is not too hot before setting your baby in the water. Dipping your elbow in the water is a good way to test. Turn down your water heater to 120 F. Never leave your baby unattended in the bathtub or bath ring. It only takes a few seconds for a baby to drown. Store small appliances, such as hair dryers and radios, away from the water and bathing areas. Keep these appliances unplugged and out of reach when not in use. Baby Toy Safety Inspect your child's toys often. Be sure that toys are unbreakable, do not come apart, do not have small parts that could be chewed or broken off, and are not sharp. The pieces/toys should be larger than your baby's mouth . Use toy chests without lids or with supports that hold a lid open in any position. Be cautious with balloons to prevent choking. Baby Choking or Strangulation Prevention NEVER put strings or cords around your baby's neck (such as to hold a pacifier ) or near your baby's crib. Be cautious of strings or buttons on clothing; make sure they are not in danger of choking your baby. Secure cords on blinds and drapes out of reach to prevent accidental strangulation. Put away small objects -- even display items -- that can cause injury or choking if swallowed. Baby Feeding Safety Never prop up your baby's bottle and leave your baby unattended; your baby could choke. Do not put your baby to bed with a bottle. Avoid giving your child raw carrots, unpeeled apples, nuts, hard candies, and other foods that present a choking hazard. In a highchair, always use restraining straps that run around your child's waist and between their legs to keep them from sliding out. Baby Sleeping Safety All infants should be put down for sleep on their backs to reduce the risk for sudden infant death syndrome, also called SIDS. Give your baby a pacifier before they go to sleep . This reduces the chance of SIDS. Avoid soft bedding that might suffocate your baby, such as pillows, blankets, plush toys, and bumpers in the crib. Crib slats should be 2 3/8 inches apart or less so the baby’s head can't get trapped. Keep your baby's room at a moderate temperature and dress them in a way that they can't overheat. This also reduces the risk of SIDS. Share a bedroom with your newborn -- but not a bed. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that parents sleep in the same room, preferably for at least the first six months. Avoid devices marketed to reduce the risk of SIDS, such as sleep positioners. Nursing your baby and making sure that your baby gets all of the recommended vaccines can help protect against SIDS. Don’t nurse in a chair or on a couch if you feel you might fall asleep. If your baby falls asleep in a car seat, swing or carrier, try to remove them and lay them on a flat surface. Try to have skin-to-skin contact with your baby. Changing Table Safety Use a sturdy table. Always keep your hands and eyes on your baby while they are on the changing table. Keep supplies within easy reach. Babies and Pets Keep food and water bowls in an area your baby can’t reach. Same with the litterbox. Supervise your child’s interactions with your pets and teach them to be gentle. Hitting or tail-pulling can lead to bites and scratches. Don’t let your animals lick your baby’s face or skin, especially if they have a cut or scrape. Wash your child’s hands after they play with the dog or cat. Keep the pet toys out of your baby’s mouth. Most doctors say pets shouldn’t sleep in your child’s bed. Baby Crawling and Walking Safety When your baby becomes mobile, here are important tips to keep your baby safe around your home: Put electrical outlet covers on all outlets. Secure electrical cords to baseboards. Install safety gates securely in front of stairs and basement doors. Avoid gates with diamond-shaped slats, which provide footholds for climbing toddlers. Instead, use gates with straight, vertical slats, and a swinging door. Use doorknob covers to keep children away from rooms and other areas with hazards. Be careful, though, that these devices are easy for adults to use in case of emergency. Store cleaners and medications out of reach and in a locked cabinet, and always in their original containers. Never store toxic substances in bottles or jars that could be mistaken for food products. Install safety locks on cabinets. Turn pot and pan handles on the stove in and cook on the back burners whenever possible. Establish the area in front of the stove as off-limits while you are cooking. Keep the toilet lid down to prevent drowning and to keep the lid from slamming on your baby's head or hands. Consider installing toilet lid locks. Cushion hard edges and sharp corners of furniture. If possible, move sharp-edged pieces of furniture away from high traffic areas. Anchor down unsteady pieces of furniture, such as bookcases. Place furniture away from high windows so children won't climb onto windowsills. Screens aren't strong enough to keep children from falling through windows. Outdoor Safety If there is a swimming pool in your backyard or your neighborhood, make sure it is surrounded by a fence and has a gate that latches or locks. Better yet, never leave your child unattended when outdoors. Cover areas under and around backyard play sets with shock-absorbing material, such as sand, rubber, or mulch, 9-12 inches deep. During hot summer days, check the temperature of slides and swings. They can become hot enough to cause burns to the skin . Always supervise children on playground equipment. Watch for hazards like stair rungs where they can get stuck, missing guardrails, protruding bolts, or dangling ropes or cords. Teach your child to stay away from stray dogs and wild animals like squirrels and raccoons when you go to the park, and make sure they don’t get hold of animal droppings, which can carry germs. Keep your child away from moving machinery, including lawnmowers and overhead garage doors. Also, keep kids away from driveways and streets. Keep your baby in the shade, if possible. Their skin is thinner and more sensitive. Cover them up with clothes and a hat, limit their time in the sun (especially between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., when the sun is strongest), don’t let them get overheated, and get them out of the sun right away if they show any signs of sunburn or dehydration , including fussiness, redness, and excessive crying. Don’t put bug spray on babies younger than 2 months. Keep them inside when bugs are biting at dawn and dusk. Cover their skin with long sleeves and pants, and cover strollers with mesh netting. Get rid of standing water in your yard where mosquitoes breed, like planters and bird baths. After 2 months bug repellent is OK, but keep it off your baby’s hands and away from their mouth and eyes. Other Baby Safety Precautions Consider taking a certified CPR class if you are not already certified. You can find out about these classes from your local Red Cross or American Heart Association chapter. You may want to post a demonstration chart near your phone. Your baby's caregivers should be CPR-certified. Gather a list of emergency numbers and keep them by the phone. These numbers should include: your child's pediatrician, your health care provider, your family doctor, a 24-hour nurse-on-call number, the police department, the fire department, 911 reminder, and poison control. If a poison is swallowed, call the poison control center (throughout the USA, call 800-222-1222 -- American Association of Poison Control Centers.) Keep poisonous house plants out of reach. For information about which plants are poisonous, contact your local county extension office. Beware of any device that claims to help prevent SIDS. Home monitors, wedges and positioners remain unproven. Name a guardian for your child. In the unfortunate event that something happens to you or your spouse, it's a good idea to have a will that names a legal guardian and alternate guardian for your child. Without a will, the court may appoint a guardian you would not have chosen. Be sure to check with the individuals named in your will to make sure they are willing to serve as your child's guardian. In your will, you can also leave assets to your child in the form of a testamentary, or ""after death"" trust."
13,How to Prevent Carbon Monoxide Poisoning,"Ovens and grills help us stay fed. Heaters keep us warm. Cars take us where we want to go. And whenever we turn on devices that run on natural gas, charcoal, gasoline, wood, or other fuels, we have to use them the right way. Carbon monoxide , produced any time a fossil fuel burns, is a gas you can’t see or smell. Ovens, heaters and other devices put out little of it when they’re working properly. But if they’re out of order, or if people use them in the wrong places, the fumes can build up. This can be life-threatening. There are things you can do to stay safe. And battery-operated detectors that are easy to find at stores can warn us of trouble. How to Avoid Danger Someone who is asleep can die from carbon monoxide poisoning without ever waking up. That’s all the more reason to make sure your home is safe. When you buy appliances that burn fuel, look for the seal of a testing agency such as UL. In your home, any equipment should be installed with vents running outdoors. Here are more tips: Maintenance: Have a qualified technician inspect your heating system, water heater and any other fuel-burning appliances every year. If you have a fireplace, the chimney needs a going-over. Emergency generators: Don’t use them in your garage or basement. Put them outside the house at least 20 feet from windows or doors. Charcoal grills and portable camp stoves: Use them only outdoors. Space heaters: Use them only when someone is awake to keep an eye on them; make sure there is some airflow in and out of the room. Don’t try to use a gas oven for heat. Vehicles: Have your car or truck’s exhaust system checked each year. If your garage is attached to your home, don’t leave a vehicle running there. Even with the garage door open, the fumes can seep inside the house. If your vehicle has a tailgate, be sure to open windows anytime you drive with the tailgate down. If you don’t, carbon monoxide can be sucked into the vehicle. Signs That Equipment Is Out of Order By keeping your eyes open, you may spot evidence that appliances are out of whack or something else is wrong. A few danger signals: Soot falling from fireplaces or appliances. Rust or water streaks on vents. Loose or disconnected vent pipes. Moisture inside windows. Cracked or crumbling masonry on a chimney. If you see any of these, have a trained technician check them out and fix whatever needs it. Carbon Monoxide Detectors These detectors are available at hardware stores and other retailers, and your home should have one or more. Buy alarms that are certified by a testing laboratory. Follow the instructions about installation and change the batteries twice a year at Daylight Savings Time. Here are a few other guidelines: Detectors should go on each level of the home and outside each sleeping area. Test the alarms once a month. Some alarms also give off audible signals on their own if the battery runs low or they break down. If you have multiple alarms, connect them all together. That way, if one of them detects trouble, they all go off. Before there’s any trouble, ask your fire department for the number to call if the alarm goes off. If you have a boat or motorhome, detectors are also available there. Symptoms If you inhale too much carbon monoxide, it builds up in your bloodstream, where it takes the place of the oxygen that belongs there. When your heart , brain , or other vital organs are deprived of that oxygen, you’re in trouble. If the dangerous gas is getting into your system, you might: Feel short of breath Get dizzy Become nauseous Get a headache Feel confused Carbon monoxide is especially dangerous for infants, pregnant women, and people with ailments such as emphysema (which damages the air sacs in your lungs ), asthma or heart disease . Smaller amounts of the fumes can hurt them. In Case of Trouble If you think carbon monoxide is affecting you or your alarm sounds, move to fresh air -- either next to a window or open door, or outside. Make sure that everyone else in the house is also in the clear. If anyone has symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning, get emergency help. More than 20,000 Americans go to emergency rooms each year because of carbon monoxide poisoning, and more than 400 people die. Don’t go back into the house until it’s safe. Your fire department can help you figure that out."
14,Carcinoid Syndrome,"What Is Carcinoid Syndrome? Carcinoid syndrome is a group of symptoms you might have with a type of cancer called carcinoid tumors. These tumors start in cells that make certain chemicals, and they release more of those chemicals into your bloodstream. The symptoms can be similar to those of other conditions like menopause or asthma . For example, there may be times when your skin suddenly gets red and warm, you have trouble breathing , or you have a rapid heartbeat. Carcinoid tumors usually grow in your stomach and intestines , but you can also get them in your lungs , pancreas , testicles, or ovaries . If you have carcinoid syndrome, it usually means the cancer has spread, most often to your lungs or liver . If your doctor finds a tumor early, they might be able to remove it. But other times, there’s no cure for carcinoid tumors. Treatments can help you live longer and better. You can also take steps to relieve the symptoms and feel more comfortable. Carcinoid Syndrome Causes Carcinoid syndrome happens because the tumors can make chemicals like hormones. When the cancer has spread to your liver, these chemicals can get into your blood . There, they can travel around your body and cause symptoms. The chemicals can go directly into your bloodstream if you have tumors in your lungs, testes, or ovaries. Carcinoid Syndrome Symptoms People with carcinoid syndrome may have: Skin that turns pink, red, or purple Small, widened blood vessels on their face Diarrhea Shortness of breath or wheezing Rapid heart rate Sudden drops in blood pressure Carcinoid Syndrome Complications Carcinoid syndrome can lead to other problems, including: Carcinoid heart disease . This can make your heart valves get thick and leak. Medicine can help, and in some cases, you may need surgery. Bowel blockage. A tumor in the lymph nodes next to your small intestine can block your digestion. This causes severe belly pain and vomiting. You might need surgery. Carcinoid crisis. Rarely, you might have a severe episode of blushing , trouble breathing , and confusion. This is an emergency that could be life-threatening, so get medical help right away. Carcinoid Syndrome Diagnosis If your doctor thinks you have carcinoid syndrome, they’ll do a physical exam and may ask you questions like: Have there been times when your skin suddenly got red and felt warm or burning? Do you often have diarrhea? Have you been short of breath? Do you sometimes wheeze? You may also need tests to look for a carcinoid tumor. Urine test . You collect your pee in containers over a 24-hour period. A lab will check it for high levels of hormones or what's left when your body breaks them down. Blood test. This could also show chemicals that the tumors release. Imaging tests . A CT scan is a series of X-rays that gives detailed views of the inside of your body. An MRI uses strong magnets and radio waves to make pictures of your organs. For radionuclide scanning, your doctor will inject you with a small amount of radioactive material, and your organs will absorb it. A special camera can spot the material and make pictures that help your doctor find a tumor. Questions for Your Doctor Where are the tumors that are causing my carcinoid syndrome? What kinds of tests will I need? What treatment do you recommend? Are there any foods I should avoid? What can I do to control my skin flushing? What other symptoms should I watch out for? Carcinoid Syndrome Treatment To treat carcinoid syndrome, your doctor will need to treat your tumors. You could have just one treatment or a combination of them. Surgery. Doctors may take out an entire organ that has tumors, such as your appendix , or remove only part of an affected area, such as a section of your bowel. Depending on where the tumor is, your doctor may also use an electric current to burn it off or cryosurgery to freeze it. Another option could be radiofrequency ablation. It uses a tool that sends electrical energy into the tumor to kill cancer cells. Chemotherapy . Strong medicines can often kill your cancer cells or slow their growth. You can take some of these drugs by mouth and get others through injections into a vein. Radiation . This treatment can destroy cancer cells or keep them from multiplying. The radiation can come from a machine outside your body, or your doctor may place a small amount of radioactive material inside your body, in or near the tumor. Liver directed therapy. This treatment kills cancer cells in your liver by blocking their blood supply. Your doctor threads a tube called a catheter into one of the arteries that carries blood to your liver. Then, they inject particles that block the blood flow to liver tumors. Biologic drugs. This type of treatment, which is also called immunotherapy , strengthens your body's defenses. Doctors inject drugs that help your immune system kill cancer cells. Drug therapy. Injected drugs such as lanreotide ( Somatuline ) and octreotide ( Sandostatin ) can help with skin flushing. They may also have a small effect on tumor growth. Telotristat ethyl (Xermelo) along with lanreotide or octreotide can help ease diarrhea. Lanreotide and octreotide attach to carcinoid cells and cut down on the amount of chemicals they make. Their side effects can include nausea , gallstones , and pain or bruising where you inject it. In some cases, doctors give octreotide with a medicine called interferon alfa to boost your body's response. Lifestyle Changes You can make smaller changes to curb the effects of carcinoid syndrome. For instance, avoid certain foods and drinks that can trigger symptoms: Alcohol Nuts Cheese Chili peppers Hot liquids It might take some trial and error to learn which are triggers for you. Your intestines could have trouble absorbing nutrients, which can lead to weight loss, weakness, and other problems. Try to eat a healthy diet, and ask your doctor whether you need to take vitamins or supplements. Carcinoid Syndrome Outlook Treatment might make the tumors go away. But the cancer may not be gone completely, or it could return. You may need regular therapy to keep it in check for as long as possible. If your treatment stops working, you can focus on making sure you're as comfortable as possible. This is called palliative care . Getting Support You don't have to face things alone. Consider joining a support group where you can you share your feelings with others who understand what it's like. Learn more about carcinoid syndrome and carcinoid tumors on the website of the Carcinoid Cancer Foundation. It also has information about how to join support groups in your area."
15,What Is Catatonia?,"Catatonia is a group of symptoms that usually involve a lack of movement and communication, and also can include agitation, confusion, and restlessness. Until recently, it was thought of as a type of schizophrenia . But doctors now understand that other mental illnesses and some conditions that throw off your body’s metabolism also can make you catatonic. About 1 person in 10 who has a severe mental illness will have catatonia at some point. Catatonia can be treated, but if it’s not, it can lead to life-threatening problems. Symptoms and Diagnosis Doctors can diagnose someone as catatonic if they have any three of these signs: Not responding to other people or their environment Not speaking Holding their body in an unusual position Resisting people who try to adjust their body Agitation Repetitive, seemingly meaningless movement Mimicking someone else’s speech Mimicking someone else’s movements Types There are three types of catatonia: Akinetic catatonia . This is the most common. Someone with akinetic catatonia often stares blankly and won’t respond when you speak to them. If they do respond, it may only be to repeat what you said. Sometimes they sit or lie in an unusual position and won’t move. Excited catatonia . With this type, the person may move around, but their movement seems pointless and impulsive. They may seem agitated, combative, or delirious, or they may mimic the movements of someone who’s trying to help them. Malignant catatonia . This type happens when the symptoms lead to other health problems, like dangerous changes in blood pressure , body temperature, or breathing or heart rate. Someone who’s catatonic for a long time may be more likely to have problems like dehydration , blood clots , or kidney failure as a result of the symptoms. Causes Doctors aren’t sure exactly what makes someone become catatonic. It happens most often with people who have mood disorders or psychotic disorders , like depression , bipolar disorder , and schizophrenia. About a third of people who are catatonic also have bipolar disorder . Several physical conditions can lead to catatonia in people who don’t have a mental illness. These include: Conditions that affect your body chemistry, like kidney problems, diabetes, and thyroid conditions Parkinson’s disease, which attacks your body’s nervous system Encephalitis , an infection that affects your brain Treatment Doctors usually treat catatonia with a kind of sedative called a benzodiazepine that’s often used to ease anxiety . Another treatment option is electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). It sends electrical impulses to the person’s brain through electrodes placed on their head. (They’re given medicine to sleep through the procedure.) It might be recommended if: Sedatives don’t work. The catatonia is severe. The person has had catatonia before. Quick action is needed to save someone’s life."
16,Precocious (Early) Puberty,"What Is Precocious Puberty? Precocious puberty , also known as early puberty, is when a child's body starts to go through the change into an adult body too soon. Puberty starts on average in girls between ages 8 and 13 and in boys between ages 9 and 14. Girls who show clear signs of puberty and its progression before age 8 and boys before age 9 are considered precocious. It affects about 1 out of 5,000 children. Many experts say that on average, puberty is starting earlier in the U.S. than it did in the past. The average age when girls get their first period has stayed roughly the same. But studies suggest that early signs—like breast development—are happening a year earlier than they did decades ago. Precocious Puberty Types There are two types of precocious puberty: Central precocious puberty This type is more common. It's just like normal puberty, but it happens early. The pituitary gland starts making hormones called gonadotropins. These hormones cause the testicles or ovaries to make other hormones: testosterone or estrogen . These sex hormones cause the changes of puberty, like breast development in girls. Peripheral precocious puberty This is also called precocious pseudopuberty and is less common. The hormones estrogen and testosterone trigger the symptoms. But the brain and pituitary gland aren't involved. It's usually a local problem with the ovaries, testicles, or adrenal glands. Precocious Puberty Symptoms The signs of early puberty and puberty are usually the same. It's the timing that's different. Signs include: Girls: Breasts start to grow (often the first sign) Menstruation (typically not until 2-3 years after the earlier symptoms start) Boys: Facial hair begins to appear Testicles, penis, and scrotum start to grow Voice deepening (this is usually a late sign of puberty) May have spontaneous erections or ejaculation Girls and boys Rapid height growth Acne Adult body odor Underarm and pubic hair There are other conditions that might look like early puberty to parents—and sometimes even to pediatricians—but aren't: Premature thelarche is when a girl's breasts start to grow at a young age. It often affects girls who are just a few years old. While troubling for parents, it gets better on its own and isn't early puberty. It doesn't require treatment, but you should still take your child to a doctor to get their input. Premature pubarche is when pubic or underarm hair starts to grow at an early age. It can result from premature adrenarche, when the adrenal glands start releasing hormones early. Again, while it might seem alarming, it generally isn't a problem. It's also not an early sign of puberty. But because it may represent the first sign of an unusual and heavy release of adrenal hormones, your child should see a doctor. Precocious Puberty Causes There are a number of reasons why kids may go through early puberty, which differ depending on the type. Central precocious puberty causes Most of the time, experts don't know what causes central precocious puberty, particularly in girls. Rarely, it can be triggered by another medical problem, such as: Tumors and other growths, which are often noncancerous (benign) Brain injury, either from surgery or a blow to the head, that affects hormonal balances Genetic conditions Seriously underactive thyroid Peripheral precocious puberty causes Usually, an underlying medical condition brings on puberty symptoms in these cases. Possibilities include: Tumors in the adrenal glands, ovaries, or testes Genetic conditions Exposure to products containing estrogen or testosterone Precocious Puberty Risk Factors While they aren't necessarily causes, a number of things are linked to early puberty. They include: Gender. Girls are 10 times as likely to have central precocious puberty as boys. Genetics. If precocious puberty is caused by a genetic problem, a child's parent or sibling may have it also. Race. Researchers don't know why, but on average, Black girls seem to start puberty about a year earlier than White girls. International adoption. One study showed that kids who are adopted outside the U.S. are 10-20 times more likely to develop precocious puberty. Experts aren't sure why, but the uncertainty of the exact ages of the adopted children might affect the study results. Obesity . A number of studies have shown a link between obesity in young girls and an increased risk of precocious puberty. But researchers don't know how direct the tie is. Obesity doesn't seem to be connected to early puberty in boys. Precocious Puberty Diagnosis To figure out if your child has precocious puberty, your doctor may: Go over their medical history Do a physical exam Do a blood test to check their hormone levels X-ray their hands and wrists to look at bone age; this tells them if the bones are growing too quickly If the doctor sees signs of precocious puberty, they'll also run a test to see what kind it is. It's called a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) stimulation test. The doctor gives your child a shot of these hormones, then takes a series of blood samples over a period to check their hormone response. If other hormones rise, that's a sign of central precocious puberty. If levels of other hormones stay the same, that's a sign of peripheral precocious puberty. Your kid may get more tests to see what may be causing their condition. That can include: An MRI to look for brain issues Blood tests for thyroid function An ultrasound to look for a tumor Questions for the doctor You'll need to work with your child's doctor to decide what to do next. These questions can help get the conversation started. Which tests will you use to determine if my child has precocious puberty? Do you see any signs to suggest this is caused by a tumor or some other medical condition? What options are available to treat this condition? What are the side effects of treatment? How long do you recommend my child stay on this treatment? How will I know if the treatment is working or not working? What local services are available to help me support my child's emotional well-being? What if we don't treat it? Precocious Puberty Treatment Your child may be referred to a specialist called a pediatric endocrinologist for treatment. The treatment approach will depend on what's causing your child's precocious puberty. Watchful waiting. In many cases, your doctor won't be able to find a cause. They may suggest watching your kid for a few months. GnRH analogue therapy. If your child has central precocious puberty and no other conditions, the doctor may suggest GnRH analogue therapy. This is a medication your child gets once a month in a shot, until they reach the normal age for puberty. It stops sexual development while they take it. Histrelin implant ( Vantas ). Your child would need a minor surgery to get this implant. The doctor puts it under the skin of the inside part of their upper arm. It also delays development but doesn't require monthly shots. The implant lasts a year. Treatment of another condition. If your kid has a condition that's causing precocious puberty, treating that will usually stop it. Precocious Puberty Complications For kids, early puberty can cause physical and emotional problems. They include: Short stature. While kids with precocious puberty are often tall for their age, some wind up short as adults. Why? Once puberty is over, growth stops. Because precocious puberty ends earlier than normal puberty, these kids stop growing at an earlier age. The result may be a shorter height than they would have otherwise had. Behavior problems. Some studies show a link between early puberty and behavior problems, particularly in kids with developmental delays . But other experts say the proof is weak. Stress . Even when it's happening to average 12-year-olds, puberty can be a confusing time. It can be all the more stressful for younger kids with early puberty. Other risks. Some studies show a link between early puberty in girls and a slightly increased risk of breast cancer later in life. But the evidence isn't clear. Keep an eye out for signs your child is struggling emotionally. This can include things like: A drop in their grades Other problems at school Avoiding social situations Loss of interest in things they usually enjoy Tips for Parents As a parent, it's easy to worry about early puberty. While you should take any signs seriously, keep in mind: Symptoms that might seem like early puberty are often unrelated and clear up on their own. When treatment is necessary, it usually works well. Most kids with signs of early puberty do fine, medically, psychologically, and socially. How to Support Your Child Most kids want to fit in. Developing early could make your child feel self-conscious. Other people may expect more maturity because they think your kid is older than they are. These challenges plus the emotional changes from extra hormones can be a lot for them to deal with. How can you help? Explain what's happening in their body in simple terms. Keep the lines of communication open. Encourage them to talk freely about their feelings. Treat them appropriately for their age. Watch out for teasing. Do what you can to boost their self-esteem. Focus your praise on grades or activities rather than appearance. Counseling or a support group may also help. Ask your child's doctor for a referral or other resources."
17,What Is Cervical Ectropion?,"Cervical ectropion happens when cells that line the inside of your cervix grow on the outside. These cells are redder and are more sensitive than the cells typically on the outside, which is why they may cause symptoms, like bleeding and discharge, for some women. The condition is sometimes called cervical eversion, ectropy, or erosion. It’s fairly common in women who are in their childbearing years, and it’s usually nothing to worry about. It’s not a sign of another health problem, like cervical cancer . But if you have symptoms that bother you, there are treatments your doctor can try. Risk Factors and Causes You may have been born with cervical ectropion. Or you may develop it later in life, most likely when your hormone levels change and estrogen levels go up, such as during puberty , pregnancy , or when you take birth control pills . A few studies have found that women who have the STD chlamydia may be more likely to have cervical ectropion, but there hasn’t been enough research to prove that link. Symptoms Many women with cervical ectropion don’t have symptoms. But some will have: Vaginal discharge , sometimes with streaks of blood Bleeding or spotting during or after sex (as long as 12 hours afterward) Pain during or after sex Diagnosis Your doctor may find you have cervical ectropion after they look at your cervix with a tool called a speculum. Cervical ectropion looks much redder than a typical cervix. But it’s important to rule out more serious conditions like cervical cancer or STDs that may look similar. Your doctor may want to do a Pap test and check for infections with a swab. They may use a tool with a bright light, called a colposcope, so they can see your cervix better. They may decide to take a sample of tissue from the area to check it for abnormal cells. Treatments Most women don’t need any treatment for cervical ectropion. If you have symptoms that started during pregnancy, they should go away 3 to 6 months after you have your baby . If you think birth control pills are causing your symptoms, you can change to another form of birth control to see if that helps. But if symptoms bother you and you want treatment, your doctor can use a few different approaches: Diathermy. Your doctor uses a small tool to apply high heat to the cells causing your symptoms, which burns and seals them off. You’ll probably get medicine to numb the area first. Cryotherapy. Also called cryosurgery, a doctor uses a probe to freeze the cells on the cervix and stop your symptoms. You’ll be awake during the procedure and probably won’t need any pain medicine. Research has found this procedure works well for women with a lot of discharge from cervical ectropion. Silver nitrate. Your doctor applies this chemical to the cervix to seal off the cells causing bleeding. You probably won’t need any numbing medicine beforehand. After any of these treatments, you may feel some mild pain like period cramps and have some light bleeding or discharge. If the pain becomes severe or the bleeding heavy, call your doctor. Don’t use tampons or have sex for about 4 weeks, until your cervix has healed. Your doctor’s office will give you any other specific instructions for what to do. Schedule any follow-up visits that your doctor recommends."
18,Cystic Fibrosis,"What Is Cystic Fibrosis? Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder, which means you get if from your parents at birth. It affects the way your body makes mucus, a substance that helps your organs and systems work. Mucus should be thin and slippery, but when you have CF, it becomes thick and glue-like. This blocks tubes and ducts throughout your body. Over time, this thick mucus builds up inside your airways. This makes it hard to breathe. The mucus traps germs and leads to infections. It can also cause severe lung damage like cysts (fluid-filled sacs) and fibrosis (scar tissue). That’s how CF got its name. More than 30,000 people in the U.S. live with cystic fibrosis. Doctors diagnose about 1,000 new cases each year. Cystic Fibrosis Symptoms People with CF can have symptoms including: Trouble with bowel movements or frequent, greasy stools Wheezing  or trouble breathing Frequent lung infections Infertility, especially in men Trouble growing or gaining weight Skin that tastes very salty Cystic Fibrosis Causes Cystic fibrosis is caused by a change, or mutation, in a gene called CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator). This gene controls the flow of salt and fluids in and out of your cells. If the CFTR gene doesn’t work the way it should, a sticky mucus builds up in your body. To get CF, you have to inherit the mutated copy of the gene from both of your parents. Ninety percent of those with affected have at least one copy of the F508del mutation. If you inherit only one copy, you won’t have any symptoms, but you will be a carrier of the disease. That means there’s a chance you could pass it to your children. About 10 million Americans are CF carriers. Every time two CF carriers have a baby, there’s a 25% (1 in 4) chance that their baby will be born with CF. Cystic Fibrosis Diagnosis Early diagnosis means early treatment and better health later in life. Every state in the U.S. tests newborns for cystic fibrosis using one or more of these three tests: Blood test. This test checks the levels of immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT). People with CF have higher levels of it in their blood. DNA test. This looks for mutations to the CFTR gene. Sweat test. It measures the salt in your sweat. Higher than normal results suggest CF. Some people who weren’t tested at birth aren’t diagnosed with CF until they become adults. Your doctor might give you DNA or sweat tests if you have symptoms of the disease. Cystic Fibrosis Treatment There’s no cure for cystic fibrosis, but medications and other therapies can ease symptoms. Medications. Your doctor may give you drugs to open your airways, thin mucus, prevent infections, and help your body get nutrients from food. These include: Antibiotics. They can prevent or treat lung infections and help your lungs work better. You might get them as pills, in an inhaler, or in a shot. Anti-inflammatory medicines. These include ibuprofen and corticosteroids. Bronchodilators. You’ll get these from an inhaler. They’ll relax and open your airways. Mucus thinners. They’ll help you get the gunk out of your airways. You’ll get them from an inhaler. CFTR modulators. These help CFTR work like it should. They can make your lungs work better and help you gain weight. Combination therapy. The new medication elexacaftor/ivacaftor/tezacaftor (Trikafta) combines three CFTR modulators to target the CFTR protein and make it work for efficiently. Airway clearance techniques. These can help get rid of mucus. You might try: Chest therapy or percussion. This involves tapping or clapping on your chest or back to clear mucus from your lungs. Someone else does this for you. Oscillating devices. You breathe into a special device that oscillates, or vibrates, your airways. This loosens mucus and makes it easier to cough up. You can wear an oscillating chest vest instead. Physical therapy for CF . This includes breathing exercises designed to push air between layers of mucus and your chest wall. They make it easier to cough up the gunk and ease blocked airways. Some common exercises include: Autogenic drainage. To do this, you breathe out hard, or huff. This moves mucus from your smaller airways to the central airways and makes it easier to get out. Active cycle of breathing. This controls your breath and relaxes the upper chest and shoulders, which can help clear mucus and prevent airway blockages. You breathe in deeply, hold it, and then huff for different lengths of time. Cystic Fibrosis Complications The lungs aren’t the only part of your body CF damages. Cystic fibrosis also affects the following organs: Pancreas. The thick mucus caused by CF blocks ducts in your pancreas. This stops proteins that break down your food, called digestive enzymes, from reaching your intestine. As a result, your body has a hard time getting the nutrients it needs. Over time, this can also lead to diabetes. Liver. If the tubes that remove bile get clogged, your liver gets inflamed. This can lead to severe scarring called cirrhosis. Small intestine. Because it can be hard to break down high-acid foods that come from your stomach, the lining of the small intestine can wear away. Large intestine. The thick fluid in your stomach can make your poop large and harder to pass. This can lead to blockages. In some cases, your intestine may also start to fold in on itself like an accordion, a condition called intussusception. Bladder. Chronic or long-lasting coughing weakens your bladder muscles. Almost 65% of women with CF have stress incontinence. This means that you leak a little pee when you cough, sneeze, laugh, or lift something. Though it’s more common in women, men can have it, too. Kidneys. Some people with CF get kidney stones. These small, hard globs of minerals can cause nausea, vomiting, and pain. If you don’t treat them, you could get a kidney infection. Reproductive organs. Excess mucus affects fertility in men and women. Most men with CF have problems with the tubes that move sperm, called the vasa deferentia. Women with CF have very thick cervical mucus, which can make it harder for a sperm to fertilize an egg. Other parts of the body. CF can also lead to muscle weakness and thinning bones, or osteoporosis.  Because it upsets the balance of minerals in your blood, it can also cause low blood pressure, fatigue, a fast heart rate, and a general feeling of weakness. Although CF is a severe condition that needs daily care, there are many ways to treat it, and there’s been a great improvement in those treatments over the years. People who have CF now can expect to live a much longer life than those who had it in the past."
19,What is Chronic Fatigue Syndrome?,"Everyone feels fatigued sometimes, and many people feel fatigued a lot of the time. But myalgic encephalomyelitis / chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) isn't just being tired. It's a new state of fatigue that has lasted for at least 6 months and can be so severe that it gets in the way of your normal daily activities, at home and at work. Rest and sleep don't seem to help. If you have it, physical activity can leave you feeling worse, typically the next day. This condition is known as post-exertional malaise. You tend to awaken almost every morning feeling as if you didn't get enough sleep. Often you wake up a lot at night, for no apparent reason. You can have trouble concentrating and multi-tasking. When you stand upright from a sitting or lying position, you may feel light-headed. Your heart might beat rapidly.  After you're on your feet for a while, you could feel terrible and need to lie down flat. ME/CFS tends to cycle through flare-ups and remissions. You'll have good days and bad days, although on the good days you won't feel back to normal. There isn't any known cure, but different treatments can help the symptoms. Facts about Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome The CDC estimates up to 2.5 million Americans have ME/CFS. Anyone can get it, including children and teens. It's most common in women in their 40s and 50s. Women are more likely to develop it than men. Most cases are mild or moderate. About 1 in 4 people with the condition have severe symptoms. If you have mild ME/CFS, you can probably manage on your own. Moderate symptoms can make it hard for you to move around. For example, you might need to sleep in the afternoons. Severe symptoms can impact your quality of life and abilities as badly as if you had lupus, heart disease, or rheumatoid arthritis. How Does It Happen? Doctors don't know what causes ME/CFS, but they have identified different underlying abnormalities in people with the condition. Immune system problems: Several parts of the immune system are different in people with ME/CFS. Some research indicates that these abnormalities may cause the symptoms of the illness. Fortunately, people with ME/CFS don't have a defective immune system in the way that people with HIV/AIDS do. Energy production: If you have ME/CFS, the cells in your body have trouble making enough energy. Brain abnormalities: Abnormalities show up in pictures of the brain (like MRI or CT scans), in levels of brain hormones, and in the brain's electrical system (brain waves). These abnormalities can come and go and aren't necessarily permanent. Blood pressure and pulse issues: When you stand, your blood pressure could drop and your heart might start to beat faster. You might feel faint or pass out if your blood pressure drops too low. Genes: Some studies have found abnormalities in the structure of certain genes. Others point to abnormalities in the way certain genes are turned on and off inside your cells. Studies of identical and non-identical twins indicate that some people inherit a genetic likelihood of getting the illness. Infections or other illness: ME/CFS often, but not always, begins with a sudden infectious-like illness (fever, sore throat, aching muscles, upset stomach). Research found that several different types of infectious agents can trigger the beginning of the illness, including Epstein-Barr virus (a common cause of mononucleosis), Lyme disease bacteria, and Q fever bacteria. Serotonin and cortisol: Several studies indicate that serotonin, a major brain chemical, plays an important role in ME/CFS symptoms. People with the illness have low levels of cortisol, a hormone the body releases in response to stress. How Can I Find Out If I Have It? The National Academy of Medicine has issued guidelines describing the combination of symptoms necessary for doctors to diagnose the condition. Unfortunately, there isn't yet a diagnostic test that's accurate enough to be useful. Because extreme fatigue is a symptom of so many conditions, your doctor will want to rule out other conditions first, before considering a diagnosis of ME/CFS. You'll need to get a complete checkup and talk with your doctor about all your symptoms."
20,What Is Chagas Disease?,"Chagas disease isn’t well-known in America, but it’s been around for thousands of years. A parasite called Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi) causes it. The disease infects up to 8 million people, mostly in Latin America. But cases recently started popping up in Texas. How Do You Get It? T. cruzi isn’t passed from person to person like a cold or flu. Instead, the parasite is spread by triatomine bugs, also known as “ kissing bugs.” They’re called that because they often bite people on the thin skin around the eyes or mouth, usually while the person is asleep. (The bites are fairly painless and probably wouldn’t wake someone up.) But the bug’s bite isn’t what causes the infection -- it’s their poop. If a bug bites an infected animal or person, it becomes a carrier of T. cruzi, which is passed through its feces. The next time the bug feeds on a person, it leaves droppings on them, which can enter that person’s body through their eyes , nose, mouth , or the wound from the bite itself. Although people mainly get infected from triatomine bugs, the parasite can be passed a few other ways: A blood transfusion or organ transplant from an infected person. Eating uncooked food that’s been contaminated with the parasite, or eating undercooked meat from an infected animal. An infected pregnant mother can transmit the disease to their baby in the womb. In November 2014, a study from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine found that bed bugs can carry T. cruzi. It’s not clear whether these bugs are likely to pass the parasite to people, though. Symptoms Chagas disease has two phases. During the first (or acute) phase, symptoms are usually mild. They might include: Fever, fatigue , or other flu -like symptoms A rash A sore where the parasite has entered the body Vomiting , diarrhea , or loss of appetite Swollen eyelids, if the parasite has entered through the eyes (known as Romaña’s sign) These early symptoms -- if they happen at all -- usually fade on their own in a few weeks or months. The only people in real danger are young children or people with already weakened immune systems. While the symptoms may go away, the parasite remains in the body. It can stay dormant for years or even decades. If the disease enters its second (or chronic) phase, it can cause serious heart and intestinal problems, including: An enlarged heart , esophagus , or colon Heart failure An altered heart rhythm Blood clots Sudden cardiac arrest Treatment Chagas disease is easiest to treat during the first phase. But the lack of symptoms can make it tough to spot early on. If you think you have it, your doctor can give you blood tests. If the tests show you're infected, you’ll need an EKG test to check for any heart problems. Two drugs can treat the disease: benznidazole (Alunbrig) and nifurtimox (Lampit), which kill the parasite. They work well if taken soon after infection. The longer someone's had Chagas disease, the less likely the drugs are to work. Pregnant women can’t take them, but infected newborns can. If you’re in the U.S., the only way to get the drugs is through the CDC, since they’re not approved by the FDA. The drugs must be taken for up to 2 months. They can cause serious side effects, especially in older people. Can It Be Prevented? There is no vaccine. The best way to prevent it is by avoiding triatomine bugs. They tend to live in homes made from mud, adobe, straw, and palm thatch, according to the CDC. If you’re traveling in Latin America, it’s best to stay out of these types of dwellings. You can also protect yourself by using nets to cover your bed while sleeping. Since 2007, blood banks in the U.S. have begun screening for Chagas, so there's no longer any chance of infection from the blood supply in America."
21,What Is a Stye?,"It's a pimple or abscess that forms on your upper or lower eyelid. Sometimes the bacteria that normally live on the surface of your eyelid block an oil duct. Then it gets inflamed. Other times, germs and dead skin cells get trapped on the edge of your eyelid. Most of the time a stye starts as a pimple next to an eyelash. It turns into a red, painful bump that can last several days before it bursts and then heals. Some styes are short-lived and heal on their own. Others may require a doctor’s care. Styes are usually on the surface of your eyelid and easy to see. But they can form deep inside your eyelid. An internal stye (on the underside of your lid) also causes a red, painful bump. But its location prevents a whitehead from showing up on your eyelid. This type can also go away once the infection is gone. Some leave a small fluid-filled cyst that your doctor will have to cut open and drain. What Causes Styes? Usually it’s a combination of a clogged oil gland and a certain type of bacteria. Your body is coated with billions of friendly bacteria that live right along with you. Most of the time there’s no problem. But when conditions are right, the bacteria overproduce and create a pimple. What’s a Chalazion? If the clogged gland that produces the stye never gets better, scar tissue forms around it. The pain goes away but a bump remains. Doctors call that a chronic chalazion (pronounced cha-LAY-zee-yon). Styes and chalazia (that’s the plural of chalazion) are usually harmless. They rarely affect your eyeball or eyesight . Rarely they can cause severe infections of the face called cellulitis . See your eye doctor for any significant pain or drastic swelling/redness of the whole eyelid. They can happen at any age and tend to come back from time to time, especially in people who have ongoing eyelid irritation (blepharitis) or a skin condition called rosacea."
22,"Chalazion: Causes, Symptoms, and Treatment","What Is a Chalazion? A chalazion is a small swelling or lump on your eyelid caused by a blocked gland. They’re called chalazia if you have more than one. A chalazion is one of the most common types of eyelid lumps. Chalazia are most likely to happen on your upper eyelid. However, you can get them on both eyes at once. Chalazia often go away and come back. Chalazion vs. stye It can be hard to tell a chalazion from a stye, another kind of eyelid bump that’s caused by an infection. Styes happen along the edge of your eyelid, sometimes in the base of an eyelash, but chalazia are usually toward the middle of the lid. A stye is more likely to be painful. It also tends to have a yellowish spot at the center that may burst after a few days. A stye can become a chalazion if the infection goes away and leaves some material stuck in the gland. Most chalazia go away on their own, but see a doctor if you have one that lingers for more than a month. (Photo credit: Ipb/Dreamstime) Chalazion Symptoms A chalazion starts with a small area that may be red, swollen, sore, or painful when touched. After a few days, the pain usually goes away, and a bump or lump remains. You may also have: Watery eyes Mild eye irritation Blurry vision How long does a chalazion last? A chalazion usually doesn’t stay for long. With some care at home, your chalazion will likely be gone within a week. Even if you don’t do anything, it should still go away in about 4-6 weeks. But if you’re worried your chalazion isn’t going away or it’s bothering you, talk with your doctor. Chalazion Causes You have glands throughout your body. They make things that are essential for your cells, tissues, and organs to work properly. The meibomian glands in your upper and lower eyelids make oil that mixes with your tears to moisten and protect your eyes. If the oil gets too thick or if the glands are blocked because of inflammation, you may get a chalazion. Sometimes chalazia are related to or caused by other health conditions. These include: Rosacea Eyelid inflammation (blepharitis) Seborrheic dermatitis Tuberculosis Viral infections Rarely, an infection can cause a chalazion. Chalazion Risk Factors Chalazia happen more often in adults than children. They might be more likely if you have: Eyelid inflammation (blepharitis) A skin condition such as seborrheic dermatitis or acne rosacea Another health condition such as diabetes Had a chalazion before Chalazion Diagnosis There are no special tests for chalazia. Your doctor will probably ask about your symptoms, past eye problems , and your health history in general. If you get chalazia more than once, your doctor may recommend that you see an eye specialist such as an ophthalmologist or optometrist. They’ll want to check for other eye problems by performing an external eye exam and an eyelid exam to check the oil glands at the base of your eyelashes. Treating eye conditions such as blepharitis and meibomian gland dysfunction can keep chalazia from coming back. Will a hardened chalazion go away? The short answer is yes. It’s normal for your chalazion to feel hard. They happen when oil gets blocked and hardens. Most of the time, they’ll go away on their own. You can also take steps to soften the hardened oil and help the bump go away faster. In rare cases, you may need your doctor to remove it. Chalazion Treatment Chalazia often go away in days or weeks without treatment. But certain things might speed up the process. Medical treatment See your doctor if you think you have a chalazion. They may want to check it and tell you how to take care of it to help it heal. They can also suggest certain eye drops or creams to use. If other treatments don’t work, your doctor can prescribe medicines or steroid injections to help clear up the problem. In severe cases, they might need to numb the area and cut it open to drain it. Home remedies One remedy is to apply warm, moist heat to the chalazion with a clean washcloth. Your doctor or nurse can give you instructions about how often to do it and for how long. It might also help clean your eyelids with a mild soap, such as baby shampoo or over-the-counter eyelid scrubs. Gently massage the area to help open the gland. But never try to squeeze or pop a chalazion. That might make the problem worse. Chalazion removal If your chalazion doesn’t go away or it gets bigger, you might want to think about surgery to remove it. Most people won’t need surgery. But if you’ve had your chalazion for more than a couple of months or if it’s growing in size, check with your doctor to see if you should have it removed. Chalazion surgery Chalazion surgery doesn’t take long. Your doctor can likely do it in the office in about 15-20 minutes. First, they’ll numb your eyelid. Then they’ll make a tiny cut in your chalazion, which will allow any fluid to drain. Your doctor can also remove the hardened oil inside your eyelid. You might have some soreness, but you won’t usually need any stitches. Your doctor might put a patch on your eye. You may use an antibiotic cream or antibiotic eye drops to make sure the incision doesn’t get infected. Other than that, you can go about your normal activities right away after surgery. Ask your doctor before surgery if they will remove your chalazion from under your eyelid to avoid a scar. Doctors can often remove chalazia this way. If they have to remove it from the outside, you might end up with a small scar. Chalazion drainage Chalazia usually go away on their own. But if yours doesn’t, your doctor might want to make a small incision or cut in the bump. By opening your chalazion up, any fluid inside it can drain out. Chalazion Healing Stages A chalazion will start out small. You might not even notice it at first. It may look like a little, red, or swollen spot on your eyelid. After several days, or perhaps a week, you might see that it looks bigger. At this stage, it shouldn’t hurt, but it will be easy for you and others to see. A chalazion can grow quickly to about the size of a pea. Usually, they’ll stop growing on their own. Most chalazia will clear up and heal in a matter of weeks. Chalazion Prevention There’s no sure way to prevent chalazia. You can lower your odds of getting them by keeping your eyelids clean: Wash your hands often, especially before touching your eyes and handling contact lenses. Wash your eyelids before you go to bed to remove makeup and other things that can clog your glands. Replace your eye makeup every 2 or 3 months. Don’t share makeup with anyone else. If you wear contact lenses, make sure to clean them well with a disinfecting lens cleaning solution. If your contacts are disposable, make sure you only wear them for the recommended amount of time. Ask your doctor if you should carefully scrub your eyelids as part of your normal routine, especially if you’ve had a chalazion more than once. When to Call a Doctor If your chalazion isn’t going away as expected with steps you’re taking at home, see an eye doctor for advice. Your doctor may suggest other steps. They can tell you if you should have your chalazion drained or removed with surgery. Let your doctor know if your chalazion goes away and then comes back. Chalazion Takeaways A chalazion is a small, red bump that can form when oil glands on your eyelid get clogged. Most of the time, chalazia will go away on their own. If you have a chalazion that doesn't heal within 4-6 weeks, talk to your doctor. Never try to pop it on your own. Chalazion FAQs What triggers a chalazion? A chalazion is a type of cyst. It forms when an oil gland in your eyelid gets blocked. As your blocked gland fills with fluid and oil, it makes a hard lump. When should I be worried about a chalazion? It might bother you to have a bump on your eyelid. But a chalazion isn’t something you need to worry a lot about. A chalazion most often will go away on its own or with easy home care. If you have concerns or your chalazion isn’t going away after about a month, be sure to talk with your doctor. Will a chalazion burst? Your chalazion isn’t likely to burst on its own. You also should never try to squeeze or pop it. Popping a chalazion could damage your eyelid and make infection more likely. If you have a chalazion that isn’t going away on its own, ask your doctor if you should take other steps or think about surgery."
23,What Is Chamomile?,"History of Chamomile Chamomile is an herb that belongs to the Asteraceae (daisy or sunflower) plant family and is grown around the world. It forms a daisylike flower with small white petals, a yellow center, and a thin stem, and can grow nearly 3 feet high. Chamomile has been used as a traditional medicine for thousands of years to calm anxiety and settle stomachs. People in ancient Rome, Greece, and Egypt used dried chamomile flowers and their essential oils as a medicinal herb. Today, two types of chamomile are still commonly used as an herbal medicine: German chamomile ( Matricaria chamomilla ), the most widely used, and Roman or English chamomile ( Chamaemelum nobile ). Chamomile comes in many forms. You can find it in capsules, tablets, liquid extracts, oils, or skin creams and ointments. In the U.S., chamomile is best known as an ingredient in herbal tea. There's no standard dose of chamomile. The most common form is tea, and some people drink one to four cups daily. (Photo credit: iStock/Getty Images) Chamomile Benefits There's not much solid research into chamomile's benefits. There's some evidence it could ease anxiety and maybe even help you sleep better. But we need more research, especially because many of the studies done so far have combined chamomile with other ingredients. Still, chamomile is generally considered safe. Historically, people have used it for: Chest colds Fever Gum inflammation (gingivitis) and canker sores Sore throats Hemorrhoids Acid reflux Diarrhea Gas Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) Inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) Heartburn Nausea and vomiting Upset stomach or stomach ulcer Some people also use chamomile in ointment or liquid form to help with skin conditions, such as: Abscesses Acne Eczema Infections such as shingles Minor first-degree burns Mouth sores due to cancer treatment (as a mouthwash) Psoriasis Some early research suggests that chamomile may be about 60% as effective as certain doses of hydrocortisone cream for eczema . Chamomile is also used as a mild sedative to improve sleep. You can try chamomile tea and other products to help with issues such as difficulty falling or staying asleep ( insomnia ), stress, anxiety , and depression. In infants and young children, some people use chamomile or products containing chamomile to ease: Chickenpox Colic Diaper rash Diarrhea Chamomile Dosage Chamomile comes in many forms, so there's no standard recommended dosage. Talk to your doctor before you use chamomile if you have any health conditions, take medication, or are pregnant or nursing. It could interact with drugs or other supplements you take. Always ask your pediatrician before giving chamomile in any form to infants or children. Chamomile tea Tea is the most common way to use the herb. Many people drink a cup after a meal to aid digestion and soothe stomach troubles. To make chamomile tea, steep a chamomile tea bag in about 8 ounces of hot water for 5-10 minutes in a mug covered with a saucer. To use dried chamomile flowers, place them in a tea infuser or tea ball. Add honey or lemon juice to add more flavor. Then, sip your tea when it has cooled to a safe temperature. Chamomile capsules Capsules are a convenient way to take chamomile, particularly if you use it at bedtime for relaxation. Dosages vary, but most range from 250-1,100 milligrams per capsule. Some studies have used 900-1,200 milligrams daily in capsule form. You usually take chamomile capsules with a full glass of water at your preferred time(s) of day. Follow directions and recommended dosage instructions on product labels. Because the FDA doesn't regulate herbal supplements, you can't be sure exactly how much chamomile your capsules contain, or whether they also contain other ingredients. Chamomile oil Chamomile oil is made by crushing and steaming the plant's flowers, which creates a blue oil. It has an earthy, yet sweet, floral or apple-like aroma. When applied to your skin, chamomile is thought to ease swelling and help stop germs from growing. You may need to dilute it with another neutral oil to avoid irritation. Do a patch test on a small area first to check for sensitivities. Chamomile oil may also be used in: Aromatherapy in a diffuser or inhaler, to promote relaxation Massage or baths, for relaxation or to relieve sore muscles Chamomile in Food The FDA says chamomile is generally safe for use in food. Dried flowers from German chamomile are commonly used in teas. Roman chamomile is more often used as a mild flavoring in other drinks and foods. You can use chamomile as an ingredient in soups, baked goods, jams, candies, and salad dressings. It's also used to flavor ice cream and cocktails and as a decorative garnish. Side Effects of Chamomile For some people, chamomile can cause side effects that range from mild to severe. Potential side effects include: Allergic eczema and eye irritation from skin creams with chamomile Drowsiness Nausea or vomiting when taking chamomile in large doses An allergic reaction, especially if you're allergic to related plants such as ragweed, daisies, marigolds, or chrysanthemums Stop using chamomile and seek immediate medical help if you have signs of a serious allergic reaction ( anaphylaxis ), such as: Trouble breathing (asthma) A red, itchy rash (contact dermatitis) Swelling of your throat or lips (angioedema) The effects of long-term chamomile use aren't known. Risks If you have any health problems, check with your doctor before using chamomile. Its risks include: Mild blood - thinning effects, which may increase the risk of bleeding if you take blood thinners such as warfarin . This usually only happens when you take chamomile in high doses for a long time. If you're having surgery, stop taking chamomile 2 weeks before the procedure. This precaution can reduce the risk of bleeding and prevent possible interactions with anesthetic drugs. Don't use chamomile if you're pregnant or nursing, as we don't know if it's safe in these conditions. Talk to a pediatrician before giving chamomile to babies or children. Medication interactions If you take any medications regularly, talk to your doctor before using chamomile supplements . In addition to b lood thinners , chamomile may interact with: Sedatives Antiplatelet drugs Antidepressants Anti-seizure medications Aspirin Benzodiazepines Cyclosporine (to prevent organ transplant rejection) Drugs used to treat insomnia Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and naproxen Also, be careful when using chamomile with other supplements such as: Garlic Ginkgo biloba Saw palmetto St. John's wort Valerian Takeaways Chamomile is a flowering plant used as a medicinal herb for centuries. We need more research into its effectiveness and long-term safety. But its potential benefits include improved sleep, reduced anxiety, relief from stomach ailments, and treatment of skin conditions. Talk to your doctor before you use it to avoid side effects. Chamomile FAQs How does chamomile help you sleep? Scientists aren't sure which compound in chamomile may be responsible for its reported ability to help you relax. It may be apigenin, which is thought to have anti-anxiety properties. It could also be that the act of drinking warm tea promotes relaxation. Who can't take chamomile? Avoid chamomile if you: Are allergic to chamomile or related plants, including ragweed, marigolds, daisies and chrysanthemums Are pregnant or nursing Have asthma Plan to drive, as it may make you sleepy Have surgery scheduled in the next couple of weeks Talk to a doctor first if you: Have other health conditions, such as cancer or digestive disorders Regularly take any medications, including blood thinners Are considering giving it to a baby or child Can you drink chamomile tea every day? We don't know how safe it is to use chamomile long-term. Drinking too much tea could cause side effects. Talk to your doctor if you plan to drink more than a cup or two a day. Does chamomile tea have caffeine? Chamomile tea has no caffeine."
24,Ichthyosis,"What Is Ichthyosis? Ichthyosis is a skin disorder in which skin cells don't properly separate or shed. This leaves behind rough, dark, scaly skin. (Photo credit: Science Source) Ichthyosis is a group of about 30 skin conditions that cause skin dryness and scaling. The condition gets its name from the Greek word for fish because the skin looks like fish scales. You might also hear it called fish scale or fish skin disease. People with this condition lose the protective barrier that keeps moisture in their skin. They also make new skin cells too quickly or shed old cells too slowly. This leads to a buildup of thick, scaly skin. Most cases of ichthyosis are mild, but it can be more severe. Some types of ichthyosis can affect your other organs, too. Ichthyosis can't be cured, but treatments can relieve the scaling and make you feel more comfortable. Types of Ichthyosis Some types only cause dry and scaly skin. Others cause problems inside the body, too. Ichthyosis has lots of types—more than 30. Most forms of the disease are very rare. They can go along with other conditions or syndromes. Some types include: Ichthyosis vulgaris . It's mild and affects about one out of every 250 people. Gray, brown, or white scales can show up usually in infancy. Most people with ichthyosis have this type. X-linked recessive ichthyosis. It affects about one out of 6,000 people, usually males. It starts at about 3-6 months and gets worse over time. You'll usually see scaling on the neck, face, trunk, and legs. Harlequin ichthyosis. You'll usually see this in newborns. It causes thick scaly plates all over the skin. It can change the way a newborn's face looks and can make it hard to move their joints. Epidermolytic ichthyosis. This type also happens in new babies. Infants with this type have fragile, blistered skin all over their bodies. Later, the blisters go away, and the skin gets scaly. Lamellar ichthyosis. Newborns with this have a clear membrane (collodion membrane) all over their bodies. After a few weeks, this covering peels away, leaving big, dark, plate-like scales. Congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma. This type is there at birth, too. Babies with this may also have a collodion membrane. Erythrokeratodermia variabilis. This type shows up in babies after a few months and can get worse or spread as they grow. Your skin may look rough, thick, or red, especially on the face, butt, arms, and legs. Progressive symmetric erythrokeratoderma. This type can start later in childhood compared with other types. You'll see dry, red, scaly skin, especially on the arms, legs, butt, face, ankles, and wrists. Ichthyosis Causes Ichthyosis can be genetic (or inherited). It also can be acquired, meaning it happens later because of another illness or from medicine you're taking. Inherited ichthyosis is a genetic condition. That means it's passed down to you from your parents. Sometimes, parents who don't have ichthyosis can still pass it down. Genes are the codes that tell your body to make proteins, which determine how your body looks and functions. When there are changes or mutations in a gene, it can cause disease. Ichthyosis gene mutations affect the proteins that protect your skin and keep it moist. They also affect how quickly your body gets rid of or grows new skin cells. Ichthyosis usually shows up in infancy or early childhood. If both of your parents have a mutation that can cause it, you're likely to have a more serious condition than if only one of them has it. Sometimes, ichthyosis is genetic without being inherited. This can happen when a new mutation comes up in a developing fetus. In this case, the baby won't have enough of a protein (filaggrin) they need for their outer skin layer. They also won't shed dead skin cells the way they should. Acquired ichthyosis shows up in adulthood. Doctors don't know why it happens, but people with it often have other conditions, including: Underactive thyroid gland Kidney disease Sarcoidosis , a rare disease that causes patches of inflammation inside the body Cancer such as Hodgkin's lymphoma HIV infection Some medicines might also trigger the condition, but it's rare. These include: Cancer drugs, such as hydroxyurea ( Droxia , Hydrea ) and vemurafenib ( Zelboraf ) Protease inhibitors, a group of drugs used to treat HIV infections Nicotinic acid , a vitamin that's used to treat high cholesterol Medicines for ulcers and acid reflux, such as cimetidine Clofazimine, which treats leprosy Ichthyosis Symptoms Your symptoms will depend on what type of ichthyosis it is. But 95% of people with it have ichthyosis vulgaris. It's possible to have ichthyosis and not even know it. You might just think you have dry skin. Dry, scaly skin is the main symptom. The scales form on only some parts of the body, such as the: Trunk Stomach Buttocks Legs Face and scalp The scales can be white, gray, or dark brown. They might have thick or thin cracks running through them. Dryness and scaling get worse in cold, dry weather. They usually improve in warmer weather. Other signs of ichthyosis vulgaris, the most common type, include: Itchy, dry skin Skin that's thick or rough and may look dirty, especially on the palms of your hands and soles of your feet White, gray, or brown scales Extra lines on the hands and feet that may be deep or even crack Rough and bumpy skin on the arms, thighs, and butt that may look like acne (keratosis pilaris) Trouble sweating Other, more severe signs of ichthyosis are: Skin redness Blisters that can break to cause wounds Peeling Itchiness Pain Lines on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet Tight skin that makes it hard to move Hair loss or hair that breaks easily Dry eyes that are hard to close Trouble hearing Trouble bending your joints Many people with ichthyosis also have eczema , a red, itchy rash . Ichthyosis usually shows up in babies or young kids before age 5. Symptoms may get worse until a child reaches puberty. Sometimes, it can get better with age. Your symptoms will depend on how severe your disease is and what's causing it. It usually doesn't go away, and you may need treatment to help with symptoms all your life. Ichthyosis Complications Skin is your body's barrier. It holds moisture inside and keeps out bacteria and other invaders that might make you sick. When ichthyosis makes pieces of your skin scale off, you lose some of this protective layer. Scaling can lead to complications such as: Skin infections Dehydration Blocked sweat glands, which can lead to overheating Slow hair growth from scales on the scalp or hair loss Burning more calories because the skin has to work harder to turn over cells Ichthyosis can cause emotional issues, too. The scales can affect the way you look. People with this condition sometimes feel depressed and have low self-esteem. Kids with ichthyosis are more likely to get: Eczema Asthma Hay fever Hives Men with ichthyosis are also at an increased risk of: Testicular cancer Undescended or hidden testicles Low sperm count Other complications include: Vision loss from damage to the cornea (the clear layer in the front of the eye ) Hearing loss Brain and nervous system problems Ichthyosis Diagnosis Sometimes it's so mild that it looks like regular dry skin . If the dryness and scaling bother you, see a dermatologist—a doctor who treats skin problems —for treatment. They may: Ask if other people in your family have any skin problems. Look at your skin, hair, and nails. Take a sample of skin to check under a microscope. This is called a biopsy . Test your blood or saliva for gene changes that cause certain types of ichthyosis. Ichthyosis Treatment It can't be cured, but treatments can help you manage dry and scaly skin. Rub cream, lotion, or ointment onto your skin every day to add moisture. Look for rich creams that have any of these ingredients: lanolin , alpha hydroxy acids, urea, or propylene glycol. Products with ceramides or cholesterol also keep skin moist. Apply the lotion right after you step out of the shower or bath, while your skin is still damp. This will help hold in moisture. Other things you can try: Take more than one bath a day to hydrate your skin. Take baths in salt water to help with burning, stinging, or itching. If you get infections often, try adding a little bit of bleach to your baths. Rub your skin with a pumice stone or rough sponge to help get rid of dead skin. Remove dead skin with a product that contains salicylic acid , glycolic acid, or lactic acid . If the dryness and scaling are severe, your doctor might prescribe an oral retinoid medicine such as acitretin ( Soriatane ) or isotretinoin ( Absorica , Claravis , Sotret , and others). Retinoids can cause side effects such as weakened bones, dry mouth , and upset stomach . You might need antibiotics for skin infections. If your skin condition is caused by another condition or medicine you're taking, treating the disease or changing the dose may help. Ichthyosis isn't life-threatening, but it can be life-changing. Your dermatologist can recommend treatments to help your skin look and feel better. If you feel depressed or have low self-esteem, talk to a therapist or other mental health experts. Ichthyosis Prevention You can't make ichthyosis go away. But there's a lot you can do to make it feel better and help with your symptoms. Some steps you can take include: Taking baths or other steps to add moisture to your skin. Staying cool. Heat and sweat can make it worse. Use a humidifier to keep heat and air conditioning from drying out your skin. Wear loose clothes that are cotton or another fabric that doesn't bother your skin. Avoid laundry detergents or other products with dyes and perfumes. It always helps to find other people with the same condition. They can be a source of support and have ideas for things to try. Look for a support group online or where you live with other people who have ichthyosis. If you're struggling with your skin condition, reach out to a mental health professional."
25,What Is Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease?,"Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease affects the nerves outside the spinal cord and brain . People with the condition can have problems with their feet and trouble balancing. Three doctors -- Jean-Martin Charcot, Pierre Marie and Howard Henry Tooth – identified a nerve disease back in 1886. Today, a whole group of genetic disorders is named after that trio. Other names it is known by are hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy and peroneal muscular atrophy . Researchers have found 90 genetic types of CMT disease. It affects roughly 1 in every 2,500 Americans. You can get a number of treatments, including physical therapy , braces and other orthopedic devices, and surgery. What Causes It? It isn't contagious. It’s passed down from parents to children in their DNA. The disease has no known cure, but scientists have identified many genes that cause the disorder. Genetic mutations in CMT affect the way that nerve cells “talk” with each other. Over time, they’re unable to work properly and start to fall apart. This can make you become weak and possibly less able to feel sensations such as a blister on your toe. Symptoms The symptoms of CMT disease generally start before you’re out of your teens . One that shows up a lot is a high arch, which happens as some foot muscles weaken while others remain strong. Another possible problem: hammertoes , in which the second, third or fourth toes bend in the middle. These can start making it hard to walk, and you tend to get blisters and calluses . As walking gets harder, you may have a hard time lifting your feet (called “ foot drop ”). You may form a “slapping” gait, in which your foot slaps against the floor. You might start to lose muscle in your lower legs. Numbness and problems with balance may set in. Later, the condition may affect your hands and arms. Usually, that’s as far as it goes, and people can live long, full lives with CMT disease. Diagnosis If you start showing symptoms, see your doctor. You’ll likely be referred to a neurologist, a specialist in the nervous system . They’ll likely take a family history, look at your symptoms, get X-rays and do some tests. Among them: Walking on your heels. This is a way to check for leg weakness . Muscle-reflex exams. One example is the knee -jerk reflex. People with CMT disease often don’t respond to these basic tests. The nerve conduction velocity test. A doctor attaches electrodes to your skin and gives your body mild shocks. This tests the ability of your nerves to send and receive messages. People with CMT have a slow or weak response. Electromyography . The doctor sticks a narrow needle into a muscle to check for electrical activity as you do things such as make a fist. In addition, your doctor may order a DNA blood test to see if you carry gene mutations for this condition. A negative test (which means one is not found) can’t rule out CMT disease because not every mutation has been identified. Treatment There is no cure for CMT disease. You can manage it in a number of ways. Foot care is important. Doctors urge people to regularly check their feet, keep their nails trimmed, and wear the right kind of shoes. Other things include: Physical therapy. This involves working with a therapist to stretch and strengthen your muscles with low-impact activities such as swimming , biking, and aerobics . Doctors recommend starting early, before the muscles start to waste away. Occupational therapy . If the disease has progressed to the arms and hands, CMT disease patients may find it hard to do everyday tasks. A specialist can train you to improve your strength, grip, and flexibility. Assistive devices. Leg braces, custom footwear, and other orthotics can provide support and ease mobility. Medication . Talk to your doctor about painkillers and other drugs that can ease the pain of muscle cramps or nerve damage . In certain cases, your doctor may recommend surgery to repair foot and joint problems. However, the disease’s effects on the nervous system can’t be reversed. You can also check into support groups, including the Charcot-Marie-Tooth Association and the Muscular Dystrophy Association. Complications Because of Charcot-Marie-Tooth’s effects on joints and movement, it can cause other problems: Breathing and swallowing problems. If the muscles that control your diaphragm are affected, you may find yourself short of breath all the time. If this happens, see a doctor at once. There are medicines that can help treat this issue. Infection. Because it may cause foot numbness, people sometimes ignore scrapes and wounds. Left untreated, they may lead to infection. Hip dysplasia. Misalignment or poor development of the hips can be more pronounced with CMT. Pregnancy risks. Women with CMT have a greater chance of complications when they’re expecting."
26,What Is Chelation Therapy?,"When metals like lead, mercury, iron, and arsenic build up in your body, they can be toxic. Chelation therapy is a treatment that uses medicine to remove these metals so they don't make you sick. Some alternative health care providers also use it to treat heart disease , autism , and Alzheimer's disease . But there's very little evidence it works for those conditions. In fact, chelation therapy can cause serious side effects -- including death -- especially if it's used in the wrong way. How Does It Work? Chelation therapy uses special drugs that bind to metals in your blood . You get the chelating medicine through an intravenous (IV) tube in your arm. It’s also available in pill form. Once the drug has attached to the metal, your body removes them both through your pee. Metals that can be removed with chelation therapy include lead, mercury, and arsenic. Before you get this treatment, your doctor will do a blood test to make sure you have metal poisoning. What Other Conditions Does It Treat? Some natural health care providers and supplement companies claim they use chelation therapy to reduce symptoms of autism , Alzheimer's disease , or heart disease . Yet this treatment is only approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat metal poisoning. Here's what the research shows regarding chelation treatment for these three conditions: Autism . The use of chelation therapy to treat this condition is based on the idea that autism is caused by mercury in childhood vaccines . Studies have proven this idea to be false. But some health care providers also believe that removing metals from the body can improve autism symptoms . The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) says there’s no evidence that chelation is an effective treatment for autism, and it may be dangerous. One child with the condition died after having this treatment. The AAP doesn't recommend using chelation therapy for autism, except in a clinical trial . Alzheimer's Disease . In patients who have this, abnormal proteins called tau and beta amyloid build up in the brain and damage it. To date, no treatment can stop or reverse this disease. Some researchers think that a buildup of metals like copper, iron, and zinc might also play a role in Alzheimer's disease. If this is true, chelation therapy might have a place in treating it. So far, there's no evidence that it works. Heart Disease . You get this when fatty deposits called plaques form in your arteries . These substances cause your blood vessels to narrow. They also make them less flexible, so less blood can flow through them. Artery plaques contain calcium . The chelating drug disodium EDTA binds to this mineral. The idea is that chelation therapy clears it out of the blood vessels. It removes plaques, too. In 2002, the National Institutes of Health did a big study on chelation therapy, called TACT. It found that this treatment somewhat reduced the risk of heart attacks , strokes, and other heart problems. But it only worked in people with diabetes . The study didn't find enough proof that it treats heart disease. And so far, the FDA hasn't approved this treatment for the condition. A new study called TACT2 may yield more information. Side Effects When chelation therapy is used the right way and for the right reason, it can be safe. The most common side effect is burning in the area where you get the IV. You might also experience fever, headache , and nausea or vomiting . Chelating drugs can bind to and remove some metals your body needs, like calcium, copper, and zinc. This can lead to a deficiency in these important substances. Some people who’ve had chelation therapy also have low calcium levels in the blood and kidney damage. Things To Watch For Today, chelation therapy is only FDA-approved to treat metal poisoning. There just isn't enough evidence to support its use for any other condition. And, as research shows, it can be dangerous if it’s used for an unapproved reason. Beware of any online products or health care providers who try to use this treatment for other purposes -- like Alzheimer's or heart disease. Chelating products are also not approved for home use. They can only be used with a doctor's prescription. If you're thinking about trying chelation therapy, talk to your doctor."
27,Congestive Heart Failure and Heart Disease,"What Is Heart Failure? Heart failure is when your heart can't pump enough blood to provide your body with the blood and oxygen it needs. If you have this condition, it doesn't mean your heart stops working. It means your heart doesn't work as efficiently as usual. Blood moves through your heart and body at a slower rate, and pressure in your heart raises. The condition affects nearly 7 million Americans. About 1 in 4 people will get diagnosed with it in their lifetime. Heart failure is the main reason why people older than 65 go to the hospital. An irregular heartbeat may be a symptom of heart failure. (Photo credit: E+/Getty Images) Heart failure pathophysiology Pathophysiology is the process that leads to heart failure. When your heart doesn't pump strongly enough, your body adapts so it can meet your body's need for blood. The chambers of the heart may stretch so they can hold more blood to pump through your body. Or the heart muscle gets stiff and thicker to keep the blood moving. Over time, the extra work causes cells in the heart to die. The heart muscle walls get weaker and are less able to pump. When your heart doesn't work well, your body releases hormones that narrow your blood vessels and make your kidneys hold onto more fluid (water) and salt. The extra fluid and salt raise your blood pressure and make your heart work even harder. Fluid builds up in your arms, legs, ankles, feet, lungs, or other organs. Doctors call this condition congestive heart failure. In time, your heart gets so weak that it can't pump enough blood to meet your body's needs. That's heart failure. Heart failure vs. heart attack Heart failure is different from a heart attack. During a heart attack, a blood clot or the buildup of a sticky substance called plaque in your arteries blocks blood flow to your heart. Without oxygen, part of the heart muscle begins to die. You need quick treatment to open up the blocked blood vessel and restore blood flow to the heart. Heart failure is a slower process. Your heart gradually becomes damaged from working too hard. Over time, it becomes less able to pump enough blood out to meet your body's needs. What Causes Heart Failure? Heart failure is caused by many conditions that damage the heart muscle, including: Coronary artery disease (CAD) . CAD happens when sticky plaque builds up in the arteries that supply blood and oxygen to the heart. Blood flow to the heart muscle drops. If the arteries become blocked or severely narrowed, the heart is starved for oxygen and nutrients. Heart attack. A heart attack is a sudden blockage in an artery that sends blood to the heart muscle. Without blood, part of the heart muscle becomes damaged and doesn't work the way it should. Cardiomyopathy. Damage to the heart muscle prevents it from pumping enough blood. Gene changes, infections, and alcohol or drug use can cause this condition. Conditions that overwork the heart. High blood pressure, heart valve disease, thyroid disease, kidney disease, diabetes , or heart problems you're born with can cause heart failure. Sometimes, more than one disease combines to cause heart failure. Heart Failure Symptoms You may not have any symptoms of heart failure. If you do have symptoms, they might be constant or come and go. They can be so mild you barely notice them or severe enough to affect your daily life. Early signs of heart failure in adults Look for these five early warning signs of heart failure: Tiredness. You'll feel extra tired if your heart doesn't get enough oxygen. Shortness of breath. A drop in oxygen-rich blood could make it hard to catch your breath. Cough or wheezing. These symptoms are from fluid buildup in your lungs. Swelling. A weak heart can't pump blood back up from the lower part of your body. Fluid can collect and cause swelling called edema in your ankles, legs, and belly. Trouble doing activities. Fatigue and shortness of breath can get in the way of your daily routine and make it hard to exercise. Other heart failure symptoms include: Raised need to pee at night from extra fluid in your body Appetite loss or nausea from bloating in your stomach Dizziness or confusion from a lack of blood to your brain Weakness because you have less blood flow to your muscles Fast or irregular heartbeat as your heart tries to pump more blood to your body Fast weight gain from fluid buildup Chest pain if a heart attack caused the heart failure Heart Failure Types Heart failure can affect the left side of the heart, the right side of the heart, or both sides. Doctors also classify heart failure based on how well the heart can still pump. Left-sided heart failure. This is the most common type. The left side of the heart, called the left ventricle, does most of the pumping. In left-sided heart failure, the left ventricle can't pump as much blood. The extra blood pools in the pulmonary veins—blood vessels that carry blood away from the lungs. Doctors divide left-sided heart failure into two types based on the heart's pumping ability: Systolic heart failure happens when the heart muscle doesn't contract with enough force to pump enough blood out to the body. Another name for this is heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (EF). EF measures how well your heart pumps with each beat. Diastolic heart failure is when the heart contracts normally, but the ventricles don't relax properly or are too stiff. Less blood can fill the heart. Another name for this is heart failure with preserved EF. Your doctor can tell you which of these conditions you have. Heart Failure Diagnosis Your doctor will ask questions like these about your medical history: Do you have any conditions that can cause heart failure, such as CAD, diabetes, heart valve disease, or high blood pressure? Do you smoke? Do you use any drugs? Do you drink alcohol, and if so, how much? Which medications do you take? Your doctor will also ask about your symptoms and do a physical exam. They will listen to your heart and look for signs of heart failure. And they will check for other illnesses that may have made your heart muscle weak or stiff. Your doctor may also order tests like these to find the cause of your heart failure and to see how severe it is: Blood tests. You may have tests to see how well your kidneys and thyroid gland work. Other blood tests check for high cholesterol levels and anemia —too few of the healthy red blood cells that transport oxygen through your body. B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) blood test. BNP is a hormone your heart releases. High BNP blood levels can mean your heart doesn't pump as well as it should. Chest X-ray. A chest X-ray shows the size of your heart and whether there is fluid buildup around the heart and lungs. Echocardiogram. This is an ultrasound that shows the heart's movement, structure, and function. EKG or ECG. An EKG records the electrical impulses that travel through your heart. Cardiac catheterization. This procedure shows your doctor how well your heart works and whether CAD caused your congestive heart failure. Stress test. This test shows how well your heart pumps while you exercise and if there are problems with blood flow. It can help your doctor diagnose coronary heart disease. Heart Failure Treatment There are more treatment options available for heart failure than ever before. Lifestyle changes, medication, and careful monitoring are the first steps. If the condition gets worse, you may need to see a doctor who specializes in treating heart failure. The goals of heart failure treatment are to prevent it from getting worse, relieve symptoms, and improve your quality of life. Your doctor might first recommend lifestyle changes like these for early-stage heart failure: Weight loss Exercise A healthy, low-sodium diet Smoking cessation Stress management Enough sleep Some common types of medicines used to treat heart failure are: Angiotensin-converting enzyme ( ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers to relax blood vessels Beta blockers to slow the heart rate Angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors to open up arteries and improve blood flow Digoxin to strengthen the heartbeat and help it pump more blood Diuretics and aldosterone antagonists to get rid of extra fluid in the body Hydralazine or isosorbide dinitrate to widen blood vessels Potassium to control the heart rhythm Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors to lower blood sugar and blood pressure Your doctor may also recommend a program called cardiac rehabilitation to help you exercise safely and keep up a heart-healthy lifestyle. This program usually includes workouts that are designed just for you, along with advice to help you quit smoking and change your diet. Cardiac rehab also offers emotional support. You'll meet other people with heart failure who can help you stay on track. If those treatments don't work, you may need one of these procedures: Coronary bypass surgery to route blood around a blocked artery. Heart valve repair or replacement to fix or repair a damaged valve in your heart. Implantable cardioverter defibrillator to put your heart back into a normal rhythm if it goes out of rhythm. Cardiac resynchronization therapy , also called a biventricular pacemaker, to help your two lower heart chambers pump blood at the same time. Ventricular assist device to pump in place of your heart until you can have surgery to fix the problem. A heart transplant is an option for people with very severe heart failure who haven't improved with surgery or medicine. The surgeon replaces your damaged heart with a healthy heart from a donor. Can heart failure be reversed? That depends on the cause. Doctors consider heart failure reversed when the EF goes back to normal. Some of the conditions that cause heart failure improve on their own, such as: Infections like myocarditis Cardiomyopathy that's caused by stress You may be able to bring the EF to normal if you: Take medicine to control an irregular heart rhythm or lower blood pressure Have a procedure to open blocked coronary arteries Stop drinking alcohol or taking drugs that caused heart failure Treat a heart valve problem The longer you've had heart failure and the more damage there is to your heart, the harder it is to reverse. A heart transplant may be the only way to reverse severe heart failure. Stages of Heart Failure Heart failure often progresses or gets worse over time. The American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology divide heart failure into four stages, based on how severe it is. Your doctor will recommend treatments for your stage of heart failure. In the early stages, lifestyle changes like diet and exercise plus medication may be enough to treat heart failure. Later stages may need surgery or a heart transplant to correct. Stage A. You're at a risk of heart failure because of a condition like high blood pressure, diabetes, or blood vessel disease. But you don't have any symptoms or problems with your heart. Stage B. You don't have symptoms, but you do have raised pressure in your heart or problems with your heart's structure. Stage C. You have or have had symptoms of heart failure. Stage D. Your heart failure symptoms are severe enough to get in the way of your daily life or put you in the hospital. The New York Heart Association divides heart failure into four categories based on how much it affects your activity level: Class 1. Heart failure doesn't affect your activity. Class 2. Heart failure slightly limits your activity. You have symptoms like tiredness, shortness of breath, heart palpitations, or chest pain when you do daily activities. Class 3. Heart failure noticeably limits your activities. Even mild activity causes tiredness, shortness of breath, heart palpitations, or chest pain. Class 4. You have heart failure symptoms even when you're at rest. How Can I Prevent Heart Failure From Getting Worse? Follow these tips to protect your heart and slow heart failure: Treat high blood pressure. In heart failure, blood vessels narrow. Your heart must work harder to pump blood through those narrowed vessels. It's important to keep your blood pressure controlled so that your heart can pump more effectively without extra stress. Monitor your symptoms. Weigh yourself every day and check your body for swelling. These are signs that you're holding onto fluid. Call your doctor if you gain 3 pounds in 1 day or 5 pounds in 1 week or if you notice any swelling. Keep a balance of fluids. Your doctor may ask you to write down how much fluid you drink and how often you go to the bathroom. The more fluid you carry in your blood vessels, the harder your heart must work to pump the extra fluid through your body. You may need to reduce the amount of fluid you drink to lower your heart's workload and prevent heart failure symptoms. Limit salt (sodium). Sodium is naturally in some foods and added to others for flavor or to make food last longer. If you follow a low-sodium diet , you should retain less fluid, have less swelling, and breathe more easily. Be aware of new or worsening symptoms. Call your doctor if you have new symptoms or if the symptoms you had get worse. Take your medications as prescribed. Medicines improve your heart's ability to pump blood, lower stress on your heart, slow heart failure, and prevent your body from holding onto fluid. Heart failure drugs help your blood vessels widen and relax, which lower s blood pressure. Schedule regular doctor appointments. During follow-up visits, your doctors will make sure that you stay healthy and your heart failure doesn't get worse. They will go over your weight and list of medications. If you have questions, write them down and bring them to your appointment. Call your doctor with any urgent questions between visits. Notify all your doctors about your heart failure, medications, and any restrictions. Also, check with your heart doctor about any new medications prescribed by another doctor. Keep good records and bring them with you to each doctor visit. How Can I Prevent Further Heart Damage? In an effort to prevent further heart damage: Stop smoking or chewing tobacco . Reach and maintain your healthy weight. Control high blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and diabetes. Exercise regularly. Don't drink alcohol. Have surgery or other procedures to treat your heart failure as recommended. How can I prevent further damage to my kidneys? Heart failure raises your risk of chronic kidney disease. Your damaged heart sends less blood to your kidneys. Without oxygen-rich blood, your kidneys can't filter your blood as well. Heart failure and kidney disease also share risks like diabetes and high blood pressure. These are some ways to protect your kidneys: Manage heart failure. Follow the treatment plan your doctor recommends. Eat right and exercise. Limit the salt, fat, and sugar in your diet. Try to get at least 30 minutes of exercise each day. Lose weight if you are overweight. Excess weight raises the risk of high blood pressure and diabetes, which can harm both your kidneys and heart. Lower your blood pressure and blood sugar. Keep your blood pressure below 140/90 or the number your doctor recommends. High blood pressure damages the heart and kidneys. Also, follow your doctor's advice to treat diabetes. High blood sugar damages blood vessels in your kidneys. What Medications Should I Avoid if I Have Heart Failure? A few medications can cause problems for people with heart failure, including: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen (Motrin or Advil) and naproxen (Aleve) Some drugs that control the heart rhythm Calcium channel blockers (if you have systolic heart failure) Some nutritional supplements, such as salt substitutes Antacids that contain sodium Cough and cold medicines that contain pseudoephedrine, such as Sudafed If you take any of these drugs, discuss them with your doctor. It's important to know the names of your medications, what they're used for, and how often and at what times you take them. Keep a list of all your medications and bring them with you to each of your doctor visits. Don't stop any heart failure medication without first talking to your doctor. Even if you have no symptoms, your medications lower your heart's workload so that it can pump better. How Can I Improve My Quality of Life With Heart Failure? There are several things you can do to improve your quality of life if you have heart failure. Among them: Exercise regularly. A regular cardiovascular exercise program, prescribed by your doctor, will help improve your strength and make you feel better. It may also lower heart failure progression. Don't overdo it. Plan your activities and include rest periods during the day. Certain activities, such as pushing or pulling heavy objects and shoveling, may worsen heart failure and its symptoms. Prevent respiratory infections. Ask your doctor about flu and pneumonia vaccines. Take your medications as prescribed. Do not stop taking them without first contacting your doctor. Get emotional or psychological support if needed. Heart failure can be difficult for your whole family. If you have questions, ask your doctor or nurse. If you need emotional support, social workers, psychologists, clergy, and heart failure support groups are a phone call away. Ask your doctor or nurse to point you in the right direction. Heart failure diet A few changes in your diet can reduce the workload on your heart and help improve your symptoms. Eat lots of fresh fruits and vegetables. Limit salt to less than 1,500 milligrams (1.5 grams) each day. Choose foods that are naturally low in salt, like fish and chicken, fresh beans and peas, eggs, milk, and plain rice. Season foods with herbs, spices, and citrus instead of salt. Eat foods that are high in fiber, such as oatmeal, almonds, and avocado. Cut back on cholesterol, sugar, and trans fats. Can Surgery Be Used to Treat Heart Failure? In heart failure, surgery may sometimes prevent further damage to the heart and improve the heart's function. Procedures used include: Coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. The most common surgery for heart failure caused by CAD is bypass surgery. Although surgery is more risky for people with heart failure, new strategies before, during, and after surgery have reduced the risks and improved outcomes. Heart valve surgery. Diseased heart valves can be treated both surgically (traditional heart valve surgery) and nonsurgically (balloon valvuloplasty). Implantable left ventricular assist device (LVAD). The LVAD is known as the ""bridge to transplantation"" for patients who haven't responded to other treatments and are hospitalized with severe systolic heart failure. This device helps your heart pump blood throughout your body. It allows you to be mobile, sometimes returning home to await a heart transplant. It may also be used as destination therapy for long-term support in patients who are not eligible for transplant. Heart transplant. A heart transplant is considered when heart failure is so severe that it doesn't respond to all other therapies, but the person's health is otherwise good. Heart Failure Treatment Is a Team Effort Heart failure management is a team effort, and you are the key player on the team. Your heart doctor will prescribe your medications and manage other medical problems. Other team members—including nurses, dietitians, pharmacists, exercise specialists, and social workers—will help you achieve success. If you notice anything unusual, don't wait until your next appointment to discuss it with your doctor. Call them right away if you have: Unexplained weight gain (more than 2 pounds in a day or 5 pounds in a week) Swelling in your ankles, feet, legs, or belly that gets worse Shortness of breath that gets worse or happens more often, especially if you wake up feeling that way Bloating with a loss of appetite or nausea Extreme fatigue or more trouble finishing your daily activities A lung infection or a cough that gets worse Fast heart rate (above 100 beats per minute or a rate noted by your doctor) New irregular heartbeat Chest pain or discomfort during activity that gets better if you rest Trouble breathing during regular activities or at rest Changes in how you sleep, like having a hard time sleeping or feeling the need to sleep a lot more than usual Less of a need to pee Restlessness, confusion Constant dizziness or lightheadedness When Should I Get Emergency Care? Go to the ER or call 911 if you have: New, unexplained, and severe chest pain that comes with shortness of breath, sweating, nausea, or weakness Fast heart rate (more than 120-150 beats per minute or a rate noted by your doctor), especially if you are short of breath Shortness of breath that doesn't get better if you rest Sudden weakness or you can't move your arms or legs Sudden, severe headache Fainting spells What Is the Outlook for People With Heart Failure? With the right care, heart failure may not stop you from doing the things you enjoy. Your prognosis or outlook for the future will depend on how well your heart muscle is functioning, your symptoms, and how well you respond to and follow your treatment plan. Everyone with a long-term illness such as heart failure should discuss their desires for extended medical care with their doctor and family. An advance directive or living will is one way to let everyone know your wishes. A living will expresses your desires about the use of medical treatments to prolong your life. This document is prepared while you are fully competent in case you are unable to make these decisions at a later time. Takeaways About one-quarter of Americans will develop heart failure in their lifetime. Conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, and CAD raise the risk. If your doctor has diagnosed you with heart failure, make sure you are on a treatment plan and that you follow your doctor's advice to protect your heart from further damage. Heart Failure FAQs How long can a person live with congestive heart failure? Around half of people with congestive heart failure live for at least 5 years. How long you live depends on how severe your heart failure is and how you treat it."
28,What Is Chondrodysplasia?,"The term “chondrodysplasia” includes a number of conditions that are caused by changes in the genes. They’re often linked to dwarfism , which stunts the growth of many parts of the body, especially the bones. Doctors usually diagnose it in babies. People with some types of chondrodysplasia are able to lead normal lives with few limitations, if any. Other types can cause both physical and mental disabilities. One of the most common types -- achondroplasia -- usually has very few limitations, except perhaps some physical ones. Most people can live a full life with it. Actor Peter Dinklage, who plays Tyrion Lannister in the HBO series “Game of Thrones,” was born with achondroplasia. At the other end of the spectrum are severe and painful forms of chondrodysplasia, such as rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata (RCDP1). This condition stunts growth in babies, causing bone problems, mental disabilities, and cataracts . Most people with it don’t live past childhood. But there is hope. Researchers are working on possible treatments from RCDP1, although they are still in the early stages. Causes Chondrodysplasias are genetic, which means they happen because of problems in genes. A child might inherit these gene flaws from parents. That’s the case with RCDP1. Achondroplasia usually happens due to a mutation in a certain gene, which a child could inherit. But more often, it happens randomly. Symptoms Beyond a person’s physical appearance -- such as short stature and a large head -- symptoms depend on what type of chondrodysplasia someone has. Some may have mental disabilities because of problems with brain development. But others do not. With other forms of chondrodysplasia, symptoms can include rough and scaly skin , a cleft palate , and deformities of the spinal cord. Some children develop cataracts , causing poor vision . Diagnosis Usually, a doctor would notice chondrodysplasia when a baby is born. The hallmarks of the condition, such as short limbs and a large head, are easy to spot. X-rays could show that the bones in the child’s arms and legs are unusually short in length and broad in width. A number of measurements of the bones in X-ray images will show they are abnormal in size. Doctors can usually also diagnose achondroplasia using ultrasound while the baby is still in the womb. There is also a genetic test that can confirm the diagnosis. Treatment Your child’s treatment will depend upon what type of chondrodysplasia they have. Most treatments don't increase your child’s height, but they could relieve other problems. If your baby has achondroplasia and is healthy, you might only need to keep in touch with your pediatrician to make sure your child is doing well and address any complications along the way. If your child has a severe form, you’ll work with a number of specialists, from physical therapists to nutritionists, and a lot of that care may happen at a hospital. In some rare cases, growth hormones have helped with bone development in people with chondrodysplasia, but it’s not a guaranteed treatment. Growth hormones don’t cure achondroplasia, and in many cases patients do not respond to any form of drugs. Some people with dwarfism may choose to have extended limb lengthening. This surgery is controversial because there are risks and it can be painful. Many times, the child only gains a few inches of height. Surgeons re-cut the limbs to “stretch” the bones, and braces hold the bones in place. A successful treatment may take several surgeries. Because the procedures can be physically and emotionally stressful, doctors recommend holding off on the surgery until the person is old enough to decide for themselves. Complications Most forms of chondrodysplasia aren’t life-threatening. But there can be painful and long-term problems with breathing, as well as: Back pain Curvature of the spine Spinal stenosis Issues with the joints Lung infections Seizures Sleep apnea Doctors will work with you to treat and manage these. Support You may want to reach out to a support group for families of people with chondrodysplasia. These groups are designed to share information, hold meetings and raise money for a cure. Also, the Billy Barty Foundation has set up a scholarship fund to improve the quality of education for students who have achondroplasia. Most people with chondrodysplasia prefer not to be singled out, but people tend to stereotype them. Children with these conditions often are bullied. It’s a good idea for you to seek counseling that helps your child handle the condition -- and helps others understand it."
29,Tai Chi and Qi Gong,"How It Works The ancient Chinese practices of tai chi and qi gong (pronounced CHEE-gung) combine slow, deliberate movements, meditation , and breathing exercises. The routines were not designed to burn calories or raise your heart rate . Instead, both tai chi and qi gong are martial arts that can help your circulation, balance, and alignment. They can also help restore your energy, called chi or qi (pronounced ""chee""). The low-impact moving meditations include standing and balancing. Although qi gong and tai chi are excellent fitness activities for beginners and people with health conditions, elite athletes also benefit from doing the slow movements, because everyone needs better balance and muscle control. The postures flow together without pause, making qi gong and tai chi look like slow, graceful dances that keep your body in constant motion. You can take a class or do the exercises outdoors, on your own, or with a group. Intensity Level: Low The moving meditation is a very low-impact exercise that puts minimal stress on joints and muscles. Areas It Targets Core: Yes. You won't be doing moves like crunches, but you'll be using your core muscles as you flow from move to move. Arms: Yes. Your arms are part of the movements in these gentle martial arts. Legs: Yes. You do the movements standing up, so tai chi and qi gong do use your leg muscles, but not in an intense way. Glutes: Yes. The exercises don’t include positions that specifically target the glutes, but those muscles will be working as you move. Back: Yes. Tai chi and qi gong use your whole body, including the muscles in your back. Type Flexibility: Yes. The movements help improve flexibility. Aerobic: No. These are moving meditations, not cardio workouts . Strength: Yes. When you do qi gong and tai chi, you're building strength in a subtle way. Your body weight is all you need. It's not about powering through muscular poses, but about engaging your whole body. Sport: No. It is not a sport. Low-Impact: Yes. The gentle movements put minimal stress on the muscles and joints. What Else You Should Know Cost: Yes. The costs are minimal. To learn the movements, it’s best to sign up for a class or follow a DVD. Good for Beginners: Both qi gong and tai chi are excellent practices for beginners. Outdoors: Yes. Classes can be held indoors or outdoors. At Home: Yes. The moving meditations can be done at home. Equipment: None is required. What Melinda Ratini, MD, Says: Qi gong and tai chi are relaxing ways to improve your flexibility and balance. Both are great ways to stay active and vital. The gentle, flowing movements are easy on the joints. But check with your doctor first if you have any conditions such as diabetes or circulation problems, or if you take any medications that can make you dizzy when you change positions. Most people will also need to do some aerobic exercise, like walking, as well as additional strength building. Check with your doctor to see what type of well-rounded program is right for you. These aren't heart -pumping workouts. But even seasoned athletes have much to gain from a meditative, deliberate approach to movement. Is It Good for Me if I Have a Health Condition? One of the best features of tai chi and qi gong is that they can be adapted to fit just about any fitness level. The gentle flowing low-impact movements are easy on your joints if you have arthritis . You can even do them seated or in a wheelchair if needed. But if you have medical issues or an injury or have recently had surgery, check with your doctor before increasing your activity. When you are pregnant , you can gain many benefits from meditative movements like tai chi and qi gong. They can increase your flexibility and improve your balance. Both activities are low-impact, so they are not going to put your joints at risk. If you have high blood pressure , some studies have shown that tai chi can help lower your blood pressure . Other research points to a drop in cholesterol levels as well. That helps lower your chances of heart disease . It may even increase your fitness level. Check with your doctor first if you have heart disease or if you take blood pressure medicine. Some blood pressure medicines can make you feel dizzy when you bend over or do certain other moves. Tai chi and qi gong can also be great ways to gently get you back into moving around if you have diabetes and have been inactive. Depending on your fitness level, your doctor will likely also suggest some cardio and more moderate activity to help manage your diabetes."
30,"Chickenpox (Varicella): Symptoms, Causes, Prevention","What is Chickenpox? Chickenpox is a very contagious infection caused by the varicella-zoster virus. It mainly affects kids, but adults can also get it. The telltale sign of chickenpox is a super-itchy skin rash with blisters. Over the course of several days, the blisters pop and start to leak. Then they crust and scab over before finally healing. Chickenpox is generally mild, especially in children. Chickenpox is an extremely contagious infection caused by the varicella-zoster virus that causes you to get a very itchy rash. (Photo credit: E+/Getty Images) Chickenpox Causes Chickenpox is caused by the varicella-zoster virus and spreads easily and quickly from someone who is infected. Who Gets Chickenpox? Children under age 2 are most at risk for chickenpox. In fact, 90% of all cases occur in young children. But older children and adults can get it too. How Do You Get Chickenpox? If someone has the virus and you touch their rash or fluid from their blisters, you can get chickenpox. The virus can also spread to you if someone with chickenpox coughs or sneezes and you breathe in droplets. When you have chickenpox, you are contagious from 1 to 2 days before the rash appears until all your blisters have dried and crusted over. Chickenpox incubation period On average, your symptoms will appear within 10 to 21 days after you have been exposed to the virus. Chickenpox Symptoms The first sign of chickenpox is usually a general feeling of not feeling well. Early-stage chickenpox Some other symptoms of chickenpox that can happen a few days before the rash include: Body aches Fever Feeling very tired Loss of appetite Headache Chickenpox rash Within a day or two, you’ll develop the most common symptom of chickenpox, which is an itchy rash. It usually shows up on your face, chest, and back first, but the spots can spread to the rest of your body. In severe cases, they can form in your mouth, eyes, anus, or genitals. It happens in three phases. During the first phase, you’ll develop itchy, raised bumps. They may be pink or red or the same color as your skin or darker. Doctors call these “papules.” As many as 250 to 500 of them can pop up all over your body. New bumps will appear for several days. In the next phase, these bumps will turn into small, fluid-filled blisters called “vesicles.” They last about a day before they pop and start to leak. Finally, these open wounds crust over and turn into scabs. As they heal, new bumps continue to appear. You could have bumps, blisters, and scabs at the same time. You can spread the virus to other people until all the spots crust over. How long does chickenpox last? Chickenpox symptoms usually last about 4-7 days. Chickenpox Diagnosis Your doctor will likely be able to tell if you have chickenpox by looking at your rash. If there is any doubt, they can do a test. Because chickenpox is highly contagious, call your doctor before going to the office. Mpox vs. chickenpox Mpox (previously known as monkeypox) and chickenpox are caused by two different viruses. With both, you will probably get a fever and you will have fluid-filled blisters, but there are differences between the two infections. Mpox spots appear all at once while chickenpox spots show up over several days. Mpox sores are typically larger and deeper than chickenpox. Mpox blisters can be painful, chickenpox blisters are just itchy. All your mpox spots will blister and then crust over at the same time. With chickenpox, you may have spots, blisters, and crusted sores at the same time. Mpox lasts longer than chickenpox. Chickenpox in Adults Most cases of chickenpox occur in young children, but adults and older children can get it too. When adults get chickenpox, they often have more severe cases and are more likely to have complications. You’re more at risk for chickenpox if you: Haven’t had the virus before Haven’t been vaccinated for it Work in a school or child care facility Live with children Chickenpox Treatment Medications can help if you have chickenpox. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) If you or your child has a high fever or achiness caused by chickenpox, reach for acetaminophen. It can help relieve pain from sores that develop on your skin or in your mouth, too. It’s safe for most people, including pregnant women. For children over 2 months old, use a product specifically made for them and read the instructions for dosing information. If your child has chickenpox, avoid anti-inflammatory painkillers like ibuprofen because they can be associated with a serious bacterial skin infection. Never give aspirin to children under age 16. It can lead to a serious complication called Reye’s syndrome that can affect the liver and brain and sometimes cause death. Prescription medicine If you’ve been exposed to someone who has chickenpox but don’t have symptoms yet, your doctor may give you an injection of a treatment called immune globulin. It can help your immune system fight chickenpox. Your doctor may consider this medication if you fall into one of the following groups: Children and adults with weakened immune systems Newborns of mothers with chickenpox shortly before or after delivery Premature babies Babies less than 1 year old Adults without evidence of immunity Pregnant A smoker Living with HIV Having chemotherapy (“chemo”) or taking high doses of steroid medication Newborn babies under 4 weeks old are also at increased risk for complications from chickenpox. If you’re at risk for severe chickenpox and already have symptoms, your doctor might prescribe an antiviral medication called acyclovir (Sitavig, Zovirax). It can help make your symptoms less severe if you begin the first dose within 24 hours of developing the rash. Don’t scratch Scratching your rash can put you at risk for a bacterial skin infection . It could also cause scarring. If you accidentally scratch your rash, wash your hands with soap and water so you don’t spread the virus. Can you get chickenpox twice? You can get chickenpox again if you’ve already had it, but it’s not common. . Chickenpox Home Remedies There are things you can do at home to ease your symptoms while your body heals. To try a home remedy that might provide chickenpox relief, you can: Take a lukewarm bath with colloidal oatmeal or baking soda. Dab calamine lotion on your itchy spots. Take an oral antihistamine to help with itching. Get plenty of rest. It's also important to: Keep cool Heat and sweat make you itch more. Use a cool, wet washcloth on super-itchy areas to calm your skin. Stay hydrated Drink lots of fluids to help your body rid itself of the virus faster. It’ll also keep you from getting dehydrated. Choose water over sugary drinks or sodas, especially if you or your child has chickenpox in the mouth . Sugar-free frozen pops are a good choice, too. Avoid hard, spicy, or salty foods that can make your mouth sore. Chickenpox Complications Adults have a higher risk for developing complications from chickenpox than children. Those with weakened immune systems due to cancer, HIV, or another condition are also at risk. Once you’ve had chickenpox, the varicella-zoster virus stays in your nerve cells for years. It can “wake up” and become active again years later. It can lead to shingles, a condition that happens when the virus, which stays in your body, turns back on . Shingles causes painful blisters. Fortunately, there’s a vaccine for shingles. The CDC recommends two doses of recombinant zoster vaccine for prevention of shingles and similar complications in adults ages 50 years and older. A version of the vaccine is also recommended for people with weakened immune systems ages 19 years and older. Other complications from chickenpox include: Dehydration Infections caused by bacteria Toxic shock syndrome Brain swelling (encephalitis) or Swelling of the brain and liver in children and teens with chicken pox who take aspirin (Reye's syndrome) Pneumonia Death (very rare) Chickenpox Vaccine The best way to prevent the spread of the virus is to get the varicella vaccine . Children who’ve never had chickenpox should get two doses of the vaccine -- the first at 12 to 15 months of age, and the second between ages 4 and 6. People over age 13 who’ve never been vaccinated should get two doses of the vaccine at least 28 days apart. If you are pregnant, have a disease that affects the immune system, have been taking medication that impacts the immune system for 2 weeks or more, have cancer, are receiving radiation or chemotherapy, or recently had a blood transfusion or received other blood products, ask your doctor before getting the vaccine. If you are over the age of 50 and have had chickenpox, a high-dose vaccine called Shingrix is available to prevent painful outbreaks of shingles. If you are over 19 years old with a weakened immune system, ask your doctor if you should get the shingles vaccine. Chickenpox Prevention After the vaccine, the best way to prevent chickenpox is to avoid being around people with chickenpox. When to See a Doctor Most cases of chickenpox are mild and go away on their own. If you have chickenpox but are otherwise healthy, call your doctor right away if you develop any of the following symptoms: The rash gets close to or spreads to one or both eyes. The rash gets very red, warm, or tender. You could have a bacterial skin infection. Bleeding or bruising around your rash Dizziness Shortness of breath Bad cough Bad stomach pain Vomiting Stiff neck You can’t control your muscles Trouble walking Trouble waking up Confusion Fever lasting more than four days Fever over 102 F Dehydration"
31,What Is Chikungunya?,"Chikungunya is a virus that's spread by mosquitoes . You can't get it from another person, but mosquitoes do get it from biting a person who is infected. Most people don't die from it, but you could have some lasting pain. In fact, the name of the chikungunya virus in the African Makonde language means ""bent over in pain."" It's been seen in as many as 60 countries in Asia, Europe, Africa, and the Americas. The chikungunya virus isn't common in the U.S., compared to other countries. Cases of the virus were reported starting in 2014 among travelers returning to the U.S. from affected areas. Since then, rare cases of local transmission have been reported in Florida, Texas, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The chikungunya virus is spread by the yellow fever mosquito and the Asian tiger mosquito, which are in the Southeastern U.S., and parts of the Southwestern U.S. The Asian tiger mosquito is also found along the East Coast and in the lower Midwestern U.S. How Do I Know if I Have It? You may see signs of chikungunya around 3 to 7 days after you’re bitten. Chikungunya symptoms typically include fever and joint pain. You also might have a headache , nausea , red eyes, a rash , and be very tired. It can be hard to know for sure that you have chikungunya because it can look like other illnesses spread by mosquitoes , such as dengue fever or the Zika virus . See your doctor if you have these symptoms, especially if you  have been somewhere that’s recently had an outbreak or live in an area where it has been reported. How Is Chikungunya Diagnosed? The doctor will take a sample of your blood to check for signs that your body is fighting off the virus. There is a test in the U.S. that can check for chikungunya, the Zika virus, and dengue. After you're tested, your doctor will advise you on how to treat your symptoms. How Do You Treat Chikungunya? There’s no antiviral chikungunya treatment – or treatment that can kill the virus itself. There's no vaccine to prevent it, either. Doctors just treat symptoms. Acetaminophen will help with pain and fever, but you shouldn't take any of the following medicines until you rule out similar infections (like dengue): Aspirin Ibuprofen Naproxen sodium Drink plenty of liquids and get a lot of rest. If you have joint and muscle pain that won't go away, your doctor may give you steroids or medicines such as methotrexate that are used to treat conditions like rheumatoid arthritis. What's the Prognosis for Chikungunya? Most people don't die from the virus. In fact, you'll probably recover in a few weeks. Acute symptoms usually end after 7 to 10 days. There can be long-term effects from getting the chikungunya virus. Some people have lasting joint and/or muscle pain that can last for months – and in some cases, it lasts for years. That's called chronic chikungunya arthritis. About 40% of people who get the virus get arthritis from it. The virus is typically harder on newborns, people over 65, and people who have high blood pressure , diabetes , or heart disease . If you or someone you know has symptoms and is in one of these groups, call your doctor right away. If you get the chikungunya virus, you're likely to be protected from getting it again. How Can I Lower My Risk for Mosquito Bites? If you’re going to a place that has an outbreak, you can do some things to lower your chances of being bitten by mosquitoes: Wear long sleeves and long pants. Stay in screened-in areas, or indoors where there’s air conditioning. If you’re in a place with no air conditioning or screens in the windows, make sure there’s a mosquito net over your bed. If you go outside without sleeves, wear a mosquito repellent that has DEET. If you need to wear sunscreen , put that on first. Dump out any standing water in things like flower pots in your house or hotel room."
32,Frostbite,"Frostbite Overview Frostbite occurs when tissues freeze. This condition happens when you are exposed to temperatures below the freezing point of skin . The condition has long been recognized. A 5,000-year-old pre-Columbian mummy discovered in the Chilean mountains offers the earliest documented evidence of frostbite . More recently, Napoleon’s chief surgeon, Baron Dominique Larrey, provided the first description of the mechanisms of frostbite in 1812, during his army’s retreat from Moscow. He also noted the harmful effects of the freeze-thaw-freeze cycle endured by soldiers who would warm their frozen hands and feet over the campfire at night only to refreeze those same parts by the next morning. Although frostbite used to be a military problem, it is now a civilian one as well. Most people who get frostbite are males ages 30 to 49. The nose, cheeks, ears, fingers, and toes (your extremities) are most commonly affected. Everyone is susceptible, even people who have been living in cold climates for most of their lives. Frostbite Causes Your body works to stay alive first and to stay functioning second. In conditions of prolonged cold exposure, your body sends signals to the blood vessels in your arms and legs telling them to constrict (narrow). By slowing blood flow to the skin, your body is able to send more blood to the vital organs, supplying them with critical nutrients and oxygen, while also preventing a further decrease in internal body temperature by exposing less blood to the outside cold. As this process continues and your extremities (the parts farthest from your heart ) become colder and colder, a condition called the hunting response is initiated. Your blood vessels are dilated (widened) for a period of time and then constricted again. Periods of dilatation are cycled with times of constriction in order to preserve as much function in your extremities as possible. However, when your brain senses that you are in danger of hypothermia (when your body temperature drops significantly below 98.6°F), it permanently constricts these blood vessels in order to prevent them from returning cold blood to the internal organs. When this happens, frostbite has begun. Frostbite is caused by 2 different means: cell death at the time of exposure and further cell deterioration and death because of a lack of oxygen. In the first, ice crystals form in the space outside of the cells. Water is lost from the cell’s interior, and dehydration promotes the destruction of the cell. In the second, the damaged lining of the blood vessels is the main culprit. As blood flow returns to the extremities upon rewarming, it finds that the blood vessels themselves are injured, also by the cold. Holes appear in vessel walls and blood leaks out into the tissues. Flow is impeded and turbulent, and small clots form in the smallest vessels of the extremities. Because of these blood flow problems, complicated interactions occur, and inflammation causes further tissue damage. This injury is the primary determinant of the amount of tissue damage you will have in the end. It is rare for the inside of the cells themselves to be frozen. This phenomenon is only seen in very rapid freezing injuries, such as those produced by frozen metals. Frostbite Symptoms A variety of frostbite classification systems have been proposed. The easiest to understand, and perhaps the one that gives the best clues to outcome, divides frostbite into 2 main divisions: superficial and deep. In superficial frostbite, you may experience burning, numbness, tingling, itching , or cold sensations in the affected areas. The regions appear white and frozen, but if you press on them, they retain some resistance. In deep frostbite, there is an initial decrease in sensation that is eventually completely lost. Swelling and blood-filled blisters are noted over white or yellowish skin that looks waxy and turns a purplish blue as it rewarms. The area is hard, has no resistance when pressed on, and may even appear blackened and dead. You will experience significant pain as the areas are rewarmed and blood flow reestablished. A dull continuous ache transforms into a throbbing sensation in 2-3 days. This may last weeks to months until final tissue separation is complete. At first the areas may appear deceptively healthy. Most people do not arrive at the doctor with frozen, dead tissue. Only time can reveal the final amount of tissue damage. When to Seek Medical Care A doctor must be able to see and examine the affected area. A simple telephone call is probably not sufficient in all but the mildest cases of cold injury to hands and feet. You need to see a doctor for care. At the time of initial evaluation, it is very difficult to categorize the injury as superficial or deep, and even more difficult to ascertain the amount of tissue damage. Therefore, all people should be seen by a doctor, who will supervise the rewarming process, attempt to classify the injury, and further guide the treatment process. Someone with frostbite will need evaluation for, and possible treatment of, hypothermia and dehydration . Exams and Tests The doctor will take a history in order to gather information on the events of the exposure and the medical condition prior to the cold injury. The doctor will take note of the vital signs, including temperature, pulse, blood pressure , and respiratory rate in order to exclude or treat any immediate life threats such as hypothermia or severe infection. X-rays may be performed, but they probably will be deferred until weeks later when they are more useful to the treatment team. The doctor will collect data in order to classify the injury as superficial or deep and the prognosis as favorable or poor. A good prognosis is heralded by intact sensation, normal skin color, blisters with clear fluid, the ability to deform the skin with pressure, and the skin becoming pink when thawed. Blisters with dark fluid, skin turning dark blue when thawed, and an inability to indent the skin with pressure indicate a poor prognosis. Frostbite Treatment - Self-Care at Home First, call for help. Keep the affected part elevated in order to reduce swelling Move to a warm area to prevent further heat loss. Note that many people with frostbite may be experiencing hypothermia. Saving their lives is more important than preserving a finger or foot. Remove all constrictive jewelry and clothes because they may further block blood flow. Give the person warm, nonalcoholic, noncaffeinated fluids to drink. Apply a dry, sterile bandage, place cotton between any involved fingers or toes (to prevent rubbing), and take the person to a medical facility as soon as possible. Never rewarm an affected area if there is any chance it may freeze again. This thaw-refreeze cycle is very harmful and leads to disastrous results. Also, avoid a gradual thaw either in the field or in the transport vehicle. The most effective method is to rewarm the area quickly. Therefore, keep the injured part away from sources of heat until you arrive at a treatment facility where proper rewarming can take place. Do not rub the frozen area with snow (or anything else, for that matter). The friction created by this technique will only cause further tissue damage. Above all, keep in mind that the final amount of tissue destruction is proportional to the time it remains frozen, not to the absolute temperature to which it was exposed. Therefore, rapid transport to a hospital is very important. Medical Treatment After initial life threats are excluded, rewarming is the highest priority. This is accomplished rapidly in a water bath heated to 40-42°C (104-107.6°F) and continued until the thaw is complete (usually 15-30 minutes). Narcotic pain medications may be given because this process is very painful. Because dehydration is very common, IV fluids may also be given. After rewarming, post-thaw care is undertaken in order to prevent infection and a continuing lack of oxygen to the area. Small clear blisters are left intact. Large, clear blisters may be removed while bloody ones are often drained but left intact so as not to disturb the underlying blood vessels and to decrease the risk of infection. A tetanus booster is given if needed. People with frostbite are hospitalized for at least 1-2 days to determine the extent of injury and to receive further treatment. Aloe vera cream is applied every 6 hours, and the area is elevated and splinted. Ibuprofen may be given to combat inflammation , and an antibiotic may be given if an infection develops. For deep frostbite, daily water therapy in a 37° to 39°C (98.6° to 102.2°F) whirlpool bath will be performed in order to remove any dead tissue. A number of experimental therapies exist, many of which aim to further treat the inflammation or decreased blood flow seen in frostbite. Next Steps - Follow-up Symptoms follow a predictable pathway. Numbness initially is followed by a throbbing sensation that begins with rewarming and may last weeks to months. This is then typically replaced by a lingering feeling of tingling with occasional electric-shock sensations. Cold sensitivity, sensory loss, chronic pain , and a variety of other symptoms may last for years. The treatment of frostbite is done over a period of weeks to months. Definitive therapy, possibly in the form of surgery, may not be performed for up to 6 months after the initial injury. Therefore, establish a working relationship between you and your doctor that will continue throughout the healing process. Prevention The first step in preventing frostbite is knowing whether you are at increased risk for the injury. Many cases of frostbite are seen in alcoholics, people with psychiatric illness, car accidents or car breakdowns in bad weather, and recreational drug misuse. All of these conditions share the problem of cold exposure and either the unwillingness or inability of a person to remove themselves from this threat. Tobacco smokers and people with diseases of the blood vessels also are at increased risk because they have an already decreased amount of blood flow to their arms and legs. Homelessness, fatigue , dehydration, improper clothing, and high altitude are additional risk factors. Although people don't always know or acknowledge these dangers, many of the dangers can be reduced or prevented. Dress for the weather. Layers are best, and mittens are better than gloves (keeps your warm fingers together while warming each other). Wear 2 pairs of socks, with the inner layer made of synthetic fiber, such as polypropylene, to wick water away from the skin and the outer layer made of wool for increased insulation. Shoes should be waterproof. Cover your head, face, nose, and ears at all times. Clothes should fit loosely to avoid a decrease in blood flow to the arms and legs. Always travel with a friend in case help is needed. Avoid smoking and alcohol. People with diabetes and anyone with vessel disease should take extra precautions, as should the very young, very old, and unconditioned. Be especially wary of wet and windy conditions. The ""feels like"" temperature (windchill) is actually much lower than the stated air temperature. Outlook A common saying among surgeons who have treated people with frostbite is ""frostbite in January, amputate in July."" It often takes months before the final separation between healthy and dead tissue may be determined. If surgery is performed too early, the risks of removing tissue that may eventually recover or leaving behind tissue that may eventually die are great. Some radiographic techniques currently are being investigated that may be able to make this division much sooner, thus permitting earlier definitive treatment. In some cases, bone scans are used to help predict the viability of tissue. Beyond this waiting period, 65% of people will suffer long-term symptoms because of their frostbite. Common symptoms include pain or abnormal sensations in the extremity, heat or cold sensitivity, excessive sweating , and arthritis. Synonyms and Keywords frostbite, frostnip (often used to refer to the precursor of frostbite), trench foot, chilblains, pernio, dead skin, dead tissue, cold weather, extremities"
33,Signs of Child Abuse,"What Are the Signs of Child Abuse? When you think of child abuse, your first thought may be of a child with bruises or other marks that raise red flags. But the signs aren’t always so clear. Abuse can be physical, sexual, or emotional. Or a child may be neglected, meaning their caregivers don’t provide for basic needs, like food or safety. What makes abuse even harder to stop is that most of the time, the abuser is someone the child knows. They may be reluctant to say something because they may want to protect that person or they are afraid of what the abuser will do if they speak up. It’s important to know how to recognize different types of abuse, and what you can do if you suspect it. Types of Child Abuse Child abuse happens when someone harms a child’s body or emotional health, development, and well-being. There are 4 main types. Physical abuse means that someone hurts a child’s body or puts them in physical danger. It doesn’t matter if the child gets seriously hurt or if it leaves a mark. Any harm is abuse. It includes when someone: Burns a child Hits, kicks, or bites Holds the child under water Shakes or throws the child Throws objects at the child Ties up the child Sexual abuse is any kind of sexual activity with a child, not just physical contact. It includes when someone: Forces a child to take part in pornographic pictures or videos Has any sexual contact with the child, from kissing in a sexual way to having sex Makes phone calls or sends emails, texts, or other messages that are sexual in any way Shows the child someone else’s genitals, as with “flashing” Shows pornography Tells “dirty” jokes or stories Emotional abuse is a pattern of behaviors that harm a child’s emotional well-being and development. This can mean when someone: Abuses others when the child is around, such as a parent, brother, sister, or pet Fails to show love and affection Ignores the child and doesn’t give emotional support and guidance Shames, belittles, criticizes, or embarrasses Teases, threatens, bullies, or yells Neglect is when a caregiver doesn’t give the child basic care and protection, such as: Clothing Food Heat in cold weather Housing with clean living conditions Medical care Neglect is also when someone leaves the child alone for long stretches of time or under dangerous conditions. Other types of child abuse include: Parental substance abuse. This happens when adults neglect or harm children through the use of drugs or alcohol . It includes situations like: A parent not able to care for a child because they're high on drugs or alcohol Giving illegal drugs or alcohol to a child Making methamphetamine (meth) while a child is around A pregnant woman's abuse of drugs or alcohol, which exposes her baby to these substances Medical neglect or abuse. A child is medically neglected when their caregivers don't provide them with needed medical or mental health treatment. Medical abuse is a rare situation in which a caregiver lies about a child's symptoms or harms them to try to get unnecessary medical attention. It's also called Munchausen syndrome by proxy . Abandonment. Many states consider this a form of child neglect. It happens when a parent leaves a child with no support or concern for their well-being, or when the parent's location is unknown. Human trafficking. This is basically a type of slavery. Children are trafficked when they're used for prostitution or pornography, or to beg, sell drugs, or work long hours for little pay. Signs of Child Abuse Abuse can be hard to recognize. Kids can get cuts and bruises or show signs of stress for lots of reasons that are a normal part of childhood. So it helps to know specific signs to look for, and trust your gut as you look at the whole picture of the child’s physical and emotional health. Signs of physical abuse may include: Bruises, welts, or other injuries that can’t be explained or don’t match with the child’s story Burns , especially from cigarettes, that can’t be explained Injury marks that have a pattern, like from a hand, belt, or other objects Injuries that are at different stages of healing Medical or dental issues that go untreated Kids who’ve been physically abused may also: Avoid any kind of touch or physical contact Be afraid to go home Seem to always be on high alert Wear clothing that doesn’t match the weather -- such as long sleeves on hot days -- to cover up bruises Withdraw from friends and activities Signs of sexual abuse may include: Avoiding a certain person for no clear reason Bloody, torn, or stained underwear Bruising or bleeding around the genitals Pain or itching around the genitals that might cause problems walking or sitting Pregnancy or STDs , especially for children under 14 years old Refusing to change clothes in front of others Running away from home Sexual activity or knowledge that people usually have only when they’re older Signs of emotional abuse may include: Constant worry about doing something wrong Speech problems or delays in learning and emotional development Depression and low self-esteem Doing poorly in school Extreme behavior, such as being way too obedient or way too demanding Headaches and stomachaches with no clear cause The child doesn’t seem close to a parent or caregiver Showing little interest in friends and activities Signs of neglect may include: Always looking dirty Being left alone or in the care of other young children Eating more than usual at a meal or saving food for later Missing a lot of school Poor weight gain and growth Doesn’t get medical, dental, or mental health care (medical neglect) You may see the same signs of neglect in children whose parents or caregivers abuse alcohol or other drugs. Signs of child trafficking could include: Missing school often Running away from home Sudden changes in style of dress or relationships Has an older ""boyfriend"" or ""girlfriend"" They talk about needing to pay off a debt They often care for children who aren't members of their family Their responses to questions seem rehearsed What to Do if You Suspect Abuse If you suspect child abuse, it’s important to report it. It isn’t a private matter or a family problem. A child’s physical and emotional well-being, and maybe even their life, could be at stake. You don’t need proof to report abuse. If you suspect it, call your local child protective services, police, a hospital, or a hotline, such as the Childhelp National Child Abuse Hotline at 800-422-4453. You don’t have to give your name. If you suspect child trafficking, call the National Human Trafficking Hotline at 888-373-7888. Depending on the situation, there are many ways you can help the child: If they need medical care right away, call 911. Take the child to the hospital -- it’s a haven for abused children. Doctors can check for signs of abuse and give medical care. Help the child stay safe. If you think someone like a babysitter or day-care worker has abused your child, keep the child away from them and contact police. If you suspect a parent or caregiver, supervise the child while they're around that person. If the abuse happened at school, tell the principal about it. But report it to your local or state child protection agency, too. Help the child get therapy to start healing the emotional damage of the abuse. Encourage the child to talk to you about what happened. But don't make it an interrogation. Focus on listening. Make sure they feel supported and know this is not their fault. It’s best to not confront the abuser yourself. Instead, contact police or a child protection agency and let them handle it."
34,What to Know About Day Care,"Your child's earliest experiences will play a big part in their development. They will build the foundation for your child's future success. Most of these experiences are the early home parenting and nurturing experiences that you give your child. But other kinds of experiences, like day care, are also a developmental influence. Many parents who work outside the home use day care. Some choose a day care based on its ability to prepare kids for a future school. Though the most common reason for day care placement is two working parents, some professionals may recommend that a child be enrolled in day care because of developmental or social needs . There's a lot to consider when choosing a high-quality day care for your child. What Is Day Care? A day care center is a business that's often located in a commercial building. It's where parents take their young children for care during daily business hours. The center is large and can provide care for more children than family child care providers. It’s usually separated into groups of similarly aged kids. It usually has several staff members or providers managed by a director. The day care might be privately owned, part of a church, in a public school, or part of an agency of the government. Licensed day care centers are available in all states. But not every center is licensed. Examples of day care programs that could be operational but not licensed include: Faith-based programs Early childhood centers run by schools Part-time programs like preschools, nursery schools, and prekindergarten programs School-age before- and after-school programs Summer camp Types of Day Care There are three regular nonparental child care businesses used by families in the U.S. Each has advantages and disadvantages, and some work well for some families, while some don’t. A good day care arrangement will match the child's needs and the family's needs. Center-based child care: This is a group child care program that has part-time or full-time care providers. They are licensed by standards that regulate safety, health, space, and staffing. Family child care: This care is provided in a different home than the one in which the child lives. If the home cares for more than three unrelated children, the provider must be licensed, depending on the state location. In-home child care: This care takes place in the home of the child. Sometimes the caregiver is a relative of the child, or they could be a nanny. Day Care Benefits There are many advantages of sending your child to day care: A variety of playmates Staff who are well trained and can establish appropriate developmental programs for children Reliability in being open year-round without fluctuations due to vacation or sickness Parent involvement in policy and curriculum Extra services when available, like field trips, music, health screenings , and more The most important benefit of choosing a day care is the quality provided by a stellar day care. The needs of your child depend on their age, but a high-quality day care will have certain characteristics. This includes caregiving that is responsive and sensitive, stimulates the senses, and has a safe, healthy environment. A high-quality day care has long-term benefits like: Increased language development Increased cognitive abilities Development of good peer relationships Decreased incidents with the caregivers Day Care Pros and Cons Parents who work traditional shifts find convenience in day care. Parents who work different shifts and need part-time care, late hours, or weekend care may have a hard time locating a day care that can meet these needs. A typical day care is open from around 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. You have to pay for that day or week. Usually, there's no flexibility in picking and choosing the hours you need specifically. Centers have a very structured and organized setup. They don't always have the ability to focus on individual routines, needs, or interests. Your children may get used to a certain provider and grow fond of them. But there may be a high turnover rate during the day. Day cares of lower quality are more often associated with negative outcomes. Low-quality centers may have child disadvantages like: Decreased language skills Increased behavioral problems Decreased cognitive performance Decreased school readiness scores Day Care Tips To find a high-quality day care, you should visit your state's department of human services website. You can search for providers by zip code and locate regulations for provider types. You also can peruse the National Association for Family Child Care site to learn more about the accreditation and licensing of good providers in your area. It's important to remember that accreditation and ratings only provide a partial explanation of the type of child care your child will receive. Responsive and warm caregiving is equally important in childcare quality, just like good parenting. When choosing a day care center for your child, you should consider the following: Visit the center. Look for clues about positive caregiving. Listen to the language the caregiver uses because this is connected to positive outcomes and high-quality care. Higher-quality facilities are usually linked to higher regulations and certifications. Check to see if the day care is licensed. Don't assume all day cares are high-quality. Do your research. Compare home-based centers with child care centers and really weigh the pros and cons. When dealing with a child with special needs , families have to remember: An increase in a child's hours of day care has not been linked to an improvement in their development. Beginning day care after a year of age might give a child additional time to learn how to handle their behavior at home first. It's important to remember that, whether your child attends day care or not, the most important aspect of childcare is what happens at home. Home life is important in child development. Interactions with parents and siblings are key. An attentive parent who provides a lot of back-and-forth interaction and good communication counts for a lot. These child-parent interactions predict a child's development more than any day care considerations do."
35,Stages of Labor,"What Are the Stages of Labor? Labor is the body’s natural process of childbirth . It lasts on average 12 to 24 hours for a first birth. Usually, labor is shorter for births after that. Labor happens in three stages. The first stage goes from when you first start having steady contractions to when you’re ready to deliver your baby. It includes an early or latent phase, when contractions are mild and the cervix begins changing to allow the baby to pass through; an active phase, when contractions are strong and most of the work happens to prepare your body for delivery; and a transitional phase when you start feeling the need to push. The second stage of labor is the actual birth of your baby, and the third stage is the delivery of the placenta. The First Stage of Labor The first stage is the longest part of labor and can last up to 20 hours. It begins when your cervix starts to open (dilate) and ends when it is completely open (fully dilated) at 10 centimeters. Early or latent labor The early or latent phase is when labor begins. You’ll have mild contractions that are 15 to 20 minutes apart and last 60 to 90 seconds. Your contractions will become more regular until they are less than 5 minutes apart. The contractions cause your cervix to dilate and efface, which means it gets shorter and thinner, and more ready for delivery. During the early phase, your cervix dilates from 0 to 6 centimeters, and contractions get stronger as time goes on. During this phase, you may have discharge from your vagina that’s clear to slightly bloody. This part of labor could take hours or even days. It’s best to spend it in the comfort of your home. Here are some things you can do to help the process along: Take a walk. Change positions often. Continue practicing breathing and relaxation techniques. Soak in a warm tub or take a warm shower. If your water has broken, talk to your doctor before soaking in a tub. Rest if you can. Drink plenty of liquids and have something light to eat. Get yourself packed and ready for the hospital if you aren’t already. Active phase While the cervix dilates from 6 to 8 centimeters (called the Active Phase), contractions get stronger and are about 3 minutes apart, lasting about 45 seconds. You may have a backache and increased bleeding from your vagina (called the ""bloody show""). If your amniotic membrane ruptures -- or your ""water breaks"" at this point -- the contractions may get much stronger. This part usually lasts about 4 to 8 hours. Your mood may become more serious as you focus on managing the contractions. You’ll depend more on your support person. It’s usually during the active phase of labor that you’ll go to the hospital or birthing center. Upon arrival, you will be asked to wear a hospital gown. Your pulse, blood pressure , and temperature  will be checked. A monitor will be placed on your abdomen for a short time, or continuously, to check for uterine contractions and assess the baby's heart rate. Your health care provider will also examine your cervix during a pelvic exam to determine how far labor has progressed. An intravenous (IV) line may be placed into a vein in your arm to deliver fluids and medications if necessary. Your doctor may have you limit what you eat and drink at this time if they think it’s possible you’ll need a C-section with general anesthesia . Some tips to help you through the active phase of labor: Try changing your position. You may want to try getting on your hands and knees to ease the discomfort of back labor. Keep walking between contractions. Empty your bladder often to make more room for the baby’s head in your pelvis. Continue practicing breathing and relaxation techniques. Ask your birth partner for a gentle massage. Listening to soothing music. Focus on taking one contraction at a time. Remember that each one brings you closer to holding your baby. Transition phase The transition phase is short, but also intense and painful. It usually takes from 15 minutes to an hour for the cervix to dilate from 8 to 10 centimeters. Contractions are 2 to 3 minutes apart and last about 1 minute. You may feel pressure on your rectum and your backache may feel worse. Bleeding from your vagina will be heavier. You may feel the urge to push, but don’t until your doctor tells you to. Pushing before your cervix is fully dilated may cause it to swell and slow down the process. The Second Stage of Labor (Delivery) The second stage of labor begins when your cervix is fully dilated at 10 centimeters. This stage continues until your baby passes through the birth canal, vagina , and is born. This stage may last 2 hours or longer. Contractions may feel different from the first stage of labor -- they will slow to 2 to 5 minutes apart and last from about 60 to 90 seconds. You’ll feel a strong urge to push with your contractions. Try to rest as much as possible between intervals of pushing, and only push when the health care provider tells you. Some tips can help you push: Try several positions -- squatting, lying on your side with your leg up, or resting on your hands and knees. Take deep breaths in and out before and after each contraction. Curl into the push as much as possible; this allows all of your muscles to work. You may get pain-relieving medications or have an episiotomy if necessary while pushing. An episiotomy is a procedure in which a small cut is made between the anus and vagina to enlarge the vaginal opening. An episiotomy may be necessary to get your baby out quicker or to prevent large, irregular tears of your vaginal wall. The location of your baby's head as it moves through the pelvis (called descent) is reported in a number called a station. If the baby's head hasn’t started its descent, the station is described at minus 3 (-3). When your baby's head is at the zero station, it is at the middle of the birth canal and is engaged in the pelvis. The station of your baby helps indicate the progress of the second stage of labor. When your baby is born, your health care provider will hold the baby with their head lowered to prevent amniotic fluid , mucus, and blood from getting into the baby's lungs . The baby's mouth and nose will be suctioned with a small bulb syringe to remove any additional fluid. Your health care provider will place the baby on your stomach and shortly after, the umbilical cord will be cut. The Third Stage of Labor (Delivery of the Placenta) The third stage of labor begins after the baby is born and ends when the placenta separates from the wall of the uterus and is passed through the vagina. This stage is often called delivery of the ""afterbirth"" and is the shortest stage of labor. It may last from a few minutes to 20 minutes. You will feel contractions but they will be less painful. If you had an episiotomy or small tear, it will be stitched during this stage of labor."
36,Headache and Nausea,"Headache and nausea are common, and they can happen to you at the same time. Experts don’t know why they seem to be more likely in some people. But they do know things like dehydration, migraine, or other conditions can cause you to have headache and nausea together. Migraine: The Most Common Cause of Headache and Nausea Migraines are the kind of headaches that are most likely to make you nauseated. Of people who have migraines, 8 out of 10 have nausea with them too. Research shows women and anyone prone to motion sickness are more apt to have nausea with migraines. It’s not clear why women are more affected than men, but some experts think it’s linked to changes in hormones. You can also get migraines during pregnancy. You might have pain on one side of your head and you may be nauseated. If you had migraines before you were pregnant, you may have fewer migraines while expecting. Or, you may notice an uptick in your number of headaches. Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS). This gastrointestinal (GI) disorder is linked to migraine headaches, but it’s not a type of migraine. It happens most often in children, though kids usually outgrow them by the time they're teenagers. Some kids with CVS go on to have migraines as adults. You’re more likely to develop CVS as an adult if you have a history of migraines or long-term marijuana use, or you’re prone to motion sickness. Triggers include hot weather, physical or emotional stress, and sinus or respiratory infections. The main symptoms of CVS are sudden episodes of severe nausea and vomiting. These attacks can last for a few hours or several days. You might vomit several times an hour. Between episodes, you may feel healthy and have no symptoms. Doctors might misdiagnose your CVS as food poisoning or stomach flu. Common Lifestyle Causes of Headache and Nausea Your lifestyle affects your health in many ways. It can sometimes increase your risk for headache and nausea. Or, you may have a health condition you can’t help, but you might get headache and nausea if your condition isn’t well-managed or controlled. Here are some examples: Alcohol. If you overdo it, you can wake up with a severe headache and nausea, vomiting, or stomach pain. You might also be dizzy, really thirsty, and super sensitive to light and sound. Or you might have a headache and nausea and vomiting when you’re withdrawing from alcohol. Caffeine. Whether you missed your morning coffee or you’re trying to cut down, caffeine withdrawal is real. In addition to having a headache and nausea, you might feel tired and have trouble concentrating. Nicotine. Too much can lead to a headache and nausea, with or without vomiting. You might also have a fast heartbeat, tightness in your chest, and trouble breathing . Food poisoning. If you eat food that has certain germs in it, you may have headaches and nausea. Or, if you’re throwing up a lot from eating bad food, you might become dehydrated. That can also give you a headache. Other Conditions That Can Cause Headache and Nausea If you’re having headaches and nausea, see your doctor and tell them about your symptoms and what seems to trigger them. They’ll help you figure out what’s going on and help you choose the right treatment. Some common causes for headache and nausea are: Cold, flu, or stomach infections. These illnesses can give you nausea and a bad headache. But unlike migraine headaches, you’ll usually have other symptoms, too, like a runny nose, diarrhea, chills, body aches, and fever. Which ones you get depend on the virus. COVID-19. The coronaviruses that cause COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have similar symptoms. They include headache, nausea, vomiting, fever, a cough, and trouble breathing. Low blood sugar. This can cause you to have nausea and headache. You might faint or be sweaty and confused. A headache can also be a sign of high blood sugar. Without treatment, high blood sugar in people with diabetes can lead to a serious condition called diabetic ketoacidosis. It can cause nausea and vomiting, weakness, confusion, or a coma. Medication withdrawal. Headache and nausea can happen when you stop taking some meds, especially common antidepressants like Lexapro, Prozac, and Zoloft. PMS and menstrual cycle. Changes in your hormone levels can cause nauseating headaches, which usually strike 2 days before, or in the first 3 days of, your period. You might have throbbing pain on one side of your head along with nausea and sensitivity to light. Preeclampsia. This condition is marked by high blood pressure during your pregnancy. You may not notice any symptoms. Or you could have severe headaches, vision changes, belly pain, nausea, or vomiting. You might pee less than usual. HELLP syndrome, a rarer condition linked to preeclampsia, can also cause you to have headache and nausea. Food poisoning. Germs that can lurk in your food may cause headaches and nausea. Or, if you’re throwing up a lot, you might become dehydrated. That can also give you a headache. High blood pressure. A severe headache, nausea, and vomiting are among the symptoms of very high blood pressure. You might hear this called a hypertensive crisis or malignant hypertension. High elevations. When you go to a much higher elevation than you’re used to, you might get altitude sickness, also known as mountain sickness. Headache and nausea are two of its symptoms. Glaucoma. High pressure inside your eyes can cause a headache along with nausea and vomiting. Rare Causes of Headaches and Nausea Some less common causes may include: Inner ear infection Carbon monoxide poisoning West Nile virus Toxic shock syndrome Dengue fever Black widow bite Cluster headaches Brain bleeding Brain injury Brain tumor Brain infection Acoustic neuroma (tumor around the nerves that connect your inner ear and your brain) Malaria and yellow fever Hepatitis A Fifth disease Kidney disease Treatments for Headaches and Nausea Some things that might help include: Reduce your stress. Stress is a common trigger for nauseating headaches. Find ways to cut it, and your attacks could get less severe and happen less often. Quit smoking. Keep a diary to identify any foods that trigger your headaches. Common culprits include chocolate and alcohol. Get plenty of sleep and rest. Take your med s . Your doctor might prescribe drugs to help prevent your headaches, especially if you’re diagnosed with migraines. Meds may also help stop your headache after it starts, or ease your symptoms. You can also take anti-nausea medications during your headaches. They come in different forms, like pills, nasal sprays, suppositories, syrups, and shots. They have a number of side effects, so work with your doctor to find the best one for you. Try complementary treatments. Some evidence shows that biofeedback and acupuncture may help ease migraines and other kinds of headaches and related symptoms, such as nausea."
37,Depression in Children,"Can Children Really Have Depression? Yes. Childhood depression is different from the normal ""blues"" and everyday emotions that children go through as they develop. Just because a child seems sad doesn't necessarily mean they have significant depression . But if the sadness becomes persistent or interferes with normal social activities, interests, schoolwork, or family life, it may mean they have a depressive illness. Keep in mind that while depression is a serious illness, it’s also a treatable one. How Can I Tell if My Child Is Depressed? The symptoms of depression in children vary. The condition is often undiagnosed and untreated because symptoms are passed off as normal emotional and psychological changes. Early medical studies focused on ""masked"" depression , where a child's depressed mood was evidenced by acting out or angry behavior. While this does happen, particularly in younger children, many children display sadness or low mood similar to adults who are depressed. The primary symptoms of depression revolve around sadness, a feeling of hopelessness, and mood changes. Signs and symptoms of depression in children include: Crankiness or anger Continuous feelings of sadness and hopelessness Social withdrawal Being more sensitive to rejection Changes in appetite, either increased or decreased Changes in sleep (sleeplessness or excessive sleep ) Vocal outbursts or crying Trouble concentrating Fatigue and low energy Physical complaints (such as stomachaches and headaches ) that don't respond to treatment Trouble during events and activities at home or with friends, in school, during extracurricular activities, and with other hobbies or interests Feelings of worthlessness or guilt Impaired thinking or concentration Thoughts of death or suicide Not all children have all of these symptoms. In fact, most will show different symptoms at different times and in different settings. Although some children may continue to do reasonably well in structured environments, most kids with significant depression will have a noticeable change in social activities, loss of interest in school, poor academic performance, or a change in appearance. Children may also begin using drugs or alcohol, especially if they are over age 12. Although relatively rare in youths under 12, young children do attempt suicide -- and may do so impulsively when they are upset or angry. Girls are more likely to attempt suicide, but boys are more likely to actually kill themselves when they make an attempt. Children with a family history of violence, alcohol abuse , or physical or sexual abuse are at greater risk for suicide, as are those with depressive symptoms. Which Children Get Depressed? Up to 3% of children and 8% of adolescents in the U.S. have depression. The condition is significantly more common in boys under age 10. But by age 16, girls have a greater incidence of depression. Bipolar disorder is more common in adolescents than in younger children. But bipolar disorder in children can be more severe than in adolescents. It may also happen with, or be hidden by, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ), obsessive compulsive disorder ( OCD ), or conduct disorder (CD). What Causes Depression in Children? As in adults, depression in children can be caused by any combination of things that relate to physical health, life events, family history, environment, genetic vulnerability, and biochemical disturbance. Depression is not a passing mood, nor is it a condition that will go away without proper treatment. Can Depression in Children Be Prevented? Children with a family history of depression are also at higher risk of depression. Children who have parents with depression tend to have their first episode of depression earlier than children whose parents don’t have the condition. Children from chaotic or conflicted families, or children and teens who abuse substances like alcohol and drugs, are also at greater risk of depression. How Is Depression Diagnosed in Children? If the symptoms of depression in your child have lasted for at least 2 weeks, schedule a visit with their doctor to make sure there are no physical reasons for the symptoms and to make sure that your child gets proper treatment. A consultation with a mental health care professional who specializes in children is also recommended. Keep in mind that the pediatrician may ask to speak with your child alone. A mental health evaluation should include interviews with you (the parent or primary caregiver) and your child, and any other psychological testing that is needed. Information from teachers, friends, and classmates can be useful for showing that these symptoms are consistent during your child's various activities and are a marked change from previous behavior. There are no specific medical or psychological tests that can clearly show depression, but tools such as questionnaires (for both the child and parents), combined with personal information, can be very useful in helping diagnose depression in children. Sometimes those therapy sessions and questionnaires can uncover other concerns that contribute to depression such as ADHD , conduct disorder , and OCD. Some pediatricians start using mental health screens at a child's 11th-year well visit and each year after. The United States Preventive Service Task Force recommends screening for anxiety in children and adolescents ages 8 to 18 years and screening for major depressive disorder (MDD) in adolescents ages 12 to 18 years. What Are the Treatment Options? Treatment options for children with depression are similar to those for adults, including psychotherapy (counseling) and medication. Your child's doctor may suggest psychotherapy first and consider antidepressant medicine as an option if there is no significant improvement. The best studies to date show that a combination of psychotherapy and medication is most effective at treating depression . But studies do show that the antidepressant fluoxetine ( Prozac ) is effective in treating depression in children and teens. The drug is officially recognized by the FDA for treatment of children ages 8 to 18 with depression. Most medications used to treat depression in children have a black box warning about the possibility of increasing suicidal thoughts. It is important to start and monitor these medications under the care of a trained professional and talk with them about the potential risks and benefits for your child. Treating children who have bipolar disorder Children with bipolar disorder are usually treated with psychotherapy and a combination of medicines, usually an antidepressant and a mood stabilizer. Antidepressants need to be used with caution, as they can trigger bouts of manic or hyperactive behavior in children with bipolar disorder. Managing a child's medication must be part of an overall care plan that includes therapy and routine primary care appointments. The FDA warns that antidepressant medications may increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior in children and adolescents with depression and other psychiatric disorders. If you have questions or concerns, discuss them with your doctor. Also, if your child is placed on these medications, it is still very important to continue to follow closely with the doctor and therapist. Long-Term Outlook Studies have found that first-time depression in children is happening at younger ages than previously. As in adults, depression may come back later in life. Depression often appears at the same time as other physical illnesses. And because studies have shown that depression may precede more serious mental illness later in life, diagnosis, early treatment, and close monitoring are crucial. As a parent, it is sometimes easier to deny that your child has depression. You may put off seeking help because of the social stigmas associated with mental illness. It is very important for you -- as the parent -- to understand depression and realize the importance of treatment so that your child may continue to grow physically and emotionally in a healthy way. It is also important to seek education about the future effects depression may have on your child throughout adolescence and adulthood. Depression in Children: Warning Signs Parents should be particularly vigilant for signs that may indicate that their child is at risk for suicide. Warning signs of suicidal behavior in children include: Many depressive symptoms (changes in eating, sleeping, activities) Social isolation, including isolation from the family Talk of suicide, hopelessness, or helplessness Increased acting-out of undesirable behaviors (sexual or behavioral) Increased risk-taking behaviors Frequent accidents Substance abuse Focus on morbid and negative themes Talk about death and dying Increased crying or reduced emotional expression Giving away possessions If you suspect that your child or teenager is depressed, take the time to listen to their concerns. Even if you don't think the problem is of real concern, remember that it may feel very real to them. It’s important to keep the lines of communication open, even if your child seems to want to withdraw. Try to avoid telling your child what to do. Instead, listen closely and you may discover more about the issues causing the problems. If you feel overwhelmed or unable to reach your child, or if you continue to be concerned, seek professional help."
38,Multifocal Motor Neuropathy,"What Is Multifocal Motor Neuropathy? Multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) is a disease that affects your body's motor nerves. Those are the nerves that control your muscles. The condition makes it hard for them to send the electrical signals that move your body, which makes your hands and arms feel weak. They’ll also twitch and cramp . MMN is not life-threatening, and, in most cases, treatments can make the muscles stronger. The disease can get worse slowly, and after a while, you may have a hard time doing daily tasks, like typing or getting dressed. But for many people, symptoms may be so mild that they don't need treatment at all. You may be able to work and stay active for many years after your diagnosis. Most people are diagnosed with MMN in their 40s and 50s, although adults from ages 20 to 80 can find out they have the disease. Causes No one knows what causes MMN. Scientists do know it’s an autoimmune disease , meaning your immune system mistakenly attacks your nerve cells as if they were invaders. Researchers are studying the disease to try to find out why it happens. Symptoms If you have MMN, you’ll most likely notice the first symptoms in your hands and lower arms. Your muscles may feel weak and cramp up or twitch in a way you can’t control. It may start in specific parts of the arm or hand, like the wrist or finger. Usually the symptoms are more severe on one side of your body. The disease may eventually affect your legs. MMN isn’t painful, and you’ll still be able to feel with your hands and arms because your sensory nerves are not affected. But your symptoms will slowly get worse as you get older. Getting a Diagnosis Doctors often mistake MMN for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. They have similar symptoms, like twitching. Unlike ALS, though, MMN is treatable. Your doctor may tell you to see a neurologist, a specialist who treats problems with the nervous system. They will give you a physical exam and also ask questions about your symptoms, like: Which muscles are giving you trouble? Is it worse on one side of your body? How long have you been feeling this way? Do you have any numbness or tingling? Does anything make your symptoms better? What makes them worse? The doctor will do some nerve and blood tests to rule out other conditions that might cause your symptoms. They may do: A nerve conduction study (NCS). This test measures how fast electrical signals travel through your nerves. Usually, your doctor will put two sensors on the skin over one of your nerves: one to transmit a small electric shock and the other to record the activity. The doctor will repeat the test on other nerves if they think that more than one is involved. A needle electromyography (EMG). Your doctor will put electrodes on your arms. The electrodes have small needles, which go into your muscle, and they’re attached by wires to a machine that can measure the electrical activity in your muscles. Your doctor will ask you to slowly flex and relax your arms so the machine can record the activity. The doctor can do this test at the same time as the NCS. A blood test to look for GM1 antibodies, part of your body’s immune system. Some people with MMN have higher levels of them. If you do have a lot of these antibodies, chances are you have the disease. You might have MNN even if you don't have a lot of the antibodies, though. Questions for Your Doctor How will MMN affect me? Do I need treatment? What kinds are available? How will they make me feel? Will I be able to work? What happens if the treatment doesn't help? Are there any clinical trials I can join? Are there any activities I won't be able to do? Treatment If your symptoms are very mild, you may not need any treatment. If you do need treatment, your doctor will probably prescribe a medication called intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIg ). You’ll get the drug directly into one of your veins through an IV. You’ll usually get it in a doctor's office, although you can learn to do it at home. If IVIg works, you should feel your muscle strength improve within 3 to 6 weeks. The effects will wear off over time, though, so you’ll need to keep having the treatment. People usually have it once a month, but it may be more or less often depending on your condition. IVIg doesn't have many side effects, but it is expensive. Doctors are testing ways to give it directly through the skin like a regular shot, but this method isn’t available for everyone. If IVIg doesn't work, your doctor may try a drug called cyclophosphamide ( Cytoxan ), which is also used to treat certain types of cancer . This drug controls symptoms by turning down your immune system. Unlike immunoglobulin, cyclophosphamide can have bad side effects, so doctors try not to use it. Taking Care of Yourself If you get treatment for MMN early, you’re more likely to have few symptoms or long-term problems. Stick to your treatment plan, and talk to your doctor about any changes in how you’re feeling. If you have trouble with certain activities, you may want to see an occupational or physical therapist. They can help you keep your muscles strong and show you how to do daily tasks more easily if your muscles are bothering you. What to Expect Many people with MMN can continue most or at least some of their normal activities. The disease can get worse for some people and keep them from doing daily tasks. The kind of problems you have depend on which of your muscles are affected. If your hand muscles are weak, you may have trouble eating, typing, writing, or buttoning clothes. If your leg muscles are affected, you could have trouble walking. Some people with severe MMN have trouble in all these areas. Getting Support To learn more about multifocal motor neuropathy, visit the web sites of the Neuropathy Action Foundation , the Neuropathy Association , or the GBS-CIDP (Guillain-Barre Syndrome-Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy] Foundation International ."
39,Muscular Dystrophy,"What Is Muscular Dystrophy? Muscular dystrophy (MD) is a group of inherited diseases in which the muscles that control movement (called voluntary muscles) progressively weaken. In some forms of this disease, the heart and other organs are also affected. There are nine major forms of muscular dystrophy: Myotonic Duchenne Becker Limb-girdle Facioscapulohumeral Congenital Oculopharyngeal Distal Emery-Dreifuss Muscular dystrophy can appear in infancy up to middle age or later, and its form and severity are determined in part by the age at which it occurs. Some types of muscular dystrophy typicallyaffect only males; some people with MD enjoy a normal life span with mild symptoms that progress very slowly; others experience swift and severe muscle weakness and wasting, dying in their late teens to early 20s. The various types of MD affect more than 50,000 Americans. Through advances in medical care, children with muscular dystrophy are living longer than ever before. Muscular Dystrophy Symptoms by Type Myotonic (also called MMD or Steinert's disease). The most common form of muscular dystrophy in adults, myotonic muscular dystrophy affects both men and women, and it usually appears any time from early childhood to adulthood. In rare cases, it appears in newborns (congenital MMD). The name refers to a symptom, myotonia -- prolonged spasm or stiffening of muscles after use. This symptom is usually worse in cold temperatures. The disease causes muscle weakness and also affects the central nervous system , heart , gastrointestinal tract, eyes , and hormone-producing glands. In most cases, daily living isn't restricted for many years. Those with myotonic MD have a decreased life expectancy. Duchenne. The most common form of muscular dystrophy in children, Duchenne muscular dystrophy typically affects only males. It appears between the ages of 2 and 6. The muscles decrease in size and grow weaker over time yet may appear larger. Disease progression varies, but many people with Duchenne (1 in 3,500 boys) need a wheelchair by the age of 12. In most cases, the arms, legs, and spine become progressively deformed, and there may be some cognitive impairment. Severe breathing and heart problems mark the later stages of the disease. Those with Duchenne MD usually die in their late teens or early 20s. Becker. This form is similar to Duchenne muscular dystrophy, but the disease is much milder: symptoms appear later and progress more slowly. It usually appears between the ages of 2 and 16 but can appear as late as age 25. Like Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Becker muscular dystrophy typically affects only males (1 in 30,000) and causes heart problems. Disease severity varies. Those with Becker can usually walk into their 30s and live further into adulthood. Limb-girdle. This appears in the teens to early adulthood and affects males and females. In its most common form, Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy causes progressive weakness that begins in the hips and moves to the shoulders, arms, and legs and the heart may be affected. Within 20 years, walking becomes difficult or impossible. Sufferers typically live to middle age to late adulthood. Facioscapulohumeral. Facioscapulohumeral refers to the muscles that move the face, shoulder blade, and upper arm bone . This form of muscular dystrophy appears in the teens to early adulthood and affects males and females. It progresses slowly, with short periods of rapid muscle deterioration and weakness. Severity ranges from very mild to completely disabling. Walking, chewing, swallowing, and speaking problems can occur. About 50% of those with facioscapulohumeral MD can walk throughout their lives, and most live a normal life span. It may also bee associated with seizures, mental health problems, and can involve the heart Congenital. Congenital means present at birth. Congenital muscular dystrophies progress slowly and affect males and females. The two forms that have been identified -- Fukuyama and congenital muscular dystrophy with myosin deficiency -- cause muscle weakness at birth or in the first few months of life, along with severe and early contractures (shortening or shrinking of muscles that causes joint problems). Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy causes abnormalities in the brain and often seizures . Oculopharyngeal. Oculopharyngeal means eye and throat. This form of muscular dystrophy appears in men and women in their 40s, 50s, and 60s. It progresses slowly, causing weakness in the eye and face muscles, which may lead to difficulty swallowing. Weakness in pelvic and shoulder muscles may occur later. Choking and recurrent pneumonia may occur. Distal. This group of rare diseases affects adult men and women. It causes weakness and wasting of the distal muscles (those farthest from the center) of the forearms, hands, lower legs, and feet . It is generally less severe, progresses more slowly, and affects fewer muscles than other forms of muscular dystrophy. Emery-Dreifuss. This rare form of muscular dystrophy appears from childhood to the early teens and affects mainly males. In very rare cases, females can be affected. For that to happen, both of a girls X chromosomes (the one they get from their mother and the one from their father) would have to have the defective gene. It causes muscle weakness and wasting in the shoulders, upper arms, and lower legs. Life-threatening heart problems are common and can also affect carriers -- those who have the genetic information for the disease but do not develop the full-blown version (including mothers and sisters of those with Emery-Dreifuss MD). Muscle shortening (contractures) occurs early in the disease. Weakness can spread to chest and pelvic muscles. The disease progresses slowly and causes less severe muscle weakness than some other forms of muscular dystrophy. Muscular Dystrophy Causes and Risk Factors Muscular dystrophy is caused by defects in certain genes, with type determined by the abnormal gene. In 1986, researchers discovered the gene that, when defective or flawed, causes Duchenne muscular dystrophy. In 1987, the muscle protein associated with this gene was named dystrophin. Duchenne muscular dystrophy occurs when that gene fails to make dystrophin. Becker muscular dystrophy occurs when a different mutation in the same gene results in some dystrophin, but it's either not enough or it's poor in quality. Scientists have discovered and continue to search for the genetic defects that cause other forms of muscular dystrophy. Most of the muscular dystrophies are a form of inherited disease called X-linked disorders or genetic diseases that mothers can transmit to their sons even though the mothers themselves are unaffected by the disease. Men carry one X chromosome and one Y chromosome. Females carry two X chromosomes. Thus, in order for a girl to become affected by muscular dystrophy, both their X chromosomes would have to carry the defective gene -- an extremely rare occurrence, since their mother would have to be a carrier (one defective X chromosome) and their father would have to have muscular dystrophy (since men carry just one X chromosome, the other is a Y chromosome). A female who carries the defective X chromosome can pass the disease to their son (whose other chromosome is a Y, from the father). A few muscular dystrophies aren't inherited at all and occur because of a new gene abnormality or mutation. Muscular Dystrophy Diagnosis To start, your doctor will examine your child and ask questions about medical and family health history. Muscular dystrophy is diagnosed using several different tests. These may include: Muscle biopsy . A small piece of muscle tissue is removed and examined to confirm the diagnosis or rule out another muscle disease. Genetic ( DNA ) testing. Genes passed down through families can cause some forms of muscular dystrophy. A blood test can determine if you or your child has the gene. Neurological tests. Various tests are done to check nervous system function, reflexes, and coordination. One example is a nerve conduction study, also called a nerve function test, or electromyography (EMG). Enzyme tests. These are blood tests that check for proteins, or enzymes, linked to muscle weakness. People with muscular dystrophy have high levels of the enzyme creatine kinase. It’s made when muscles are damaged. They also have higher levels of serum aldolase, which is made when your body breaks down sugar into energy. Heart monitoring. An electrocardiogram may be done to check for an abnormal heartbeat . Some types of muscular dystrophy cause irregular heartbeats. MRI or ultrasound . These imaging tests give the doctor a look at muscle quality and can reveal if fat is replacing muscle tissue. Muscular Dystrophy Treatment There is no cure for muscular dystrophy, but treatments can help manage symptoms and improve quality of life. Medications Prescription drugs are available to control muscular dystrophy symptoms or slow their progression. Medications for muscular dystrophy include: Steroids . Corticosteroids, such as prednisone and deflazacort (Emflaza), are the standard of care for muscular dystrophy. They help improve muscle strength and breathing and decrease weakness. Side effects include high blood pressure and weight gain . People who use steroids for a long time are at risk for brittle bones. Medicines targeting gene mutations. Eteplirsen (Exondys 51) and golodirsen (Vyondys 53) increase the level of the gene dystrophin. They’re approved to specifically treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Anticonvulsants. Often used to treat epilepsy , these antiseizure drugs may also help reduce muscle spasms . Immunosuppressants. These powerful medicines are often used to treat lupus and other autoimmune diseases . When given to people with muscular dystrophy, they may help prevent some muscle cell damage. Antibiotics. The doctor may prescribe an antibiotic to treat a lung infection, which is common in people with muscular dystrophy. Physical therapy Physical therapy helps keep joints and muscles flexible. It’s an important part of a muscular dystrophy treatment plan. The goal of physical therapy is to improve strength in the large muscle groups and prevent scoliosis and contractures. Physical therapy for muscular dystrophy may involve: Range of motion exercises Stretching Low-impact workouts, such as swimming or water exercise (aquatic therapy) Respiratory care Muscle weakness can affect the lungs, making breathing difficult. A respiratory therapist can teach you and your child how to properly use a mask, nose device, or mouthpiece. Mobility and positioning aids Braces, walkers, or wheelchairs help provide mobility and independence to people with muscular dystrophy. Standing with a walker, even for just a little bit each day, boosts blood flow and helps build better bones. Speech therapy Muscle weakness in the face and throat can make speaking difficult. Learning how to properly pace breathing and talking can be helpful. A speech therapist can also show you how to use speech communication devices. Surgery Surgery may be recommended to manage or correct complications of muscular dystrophy. For example, cataract surgery may be done to replace a cloudy eye lens. Or a person with muscular dystrophy may need spinal fusion surgery to treat scoliosis, or heart surgery to implant a pacemaker . Muscular Dystrophy Complications The complications of muscular dystrophy depend on the type. Some types are mild, while others are serious and get worse very fast. Worsening muscle weakness can affect the ability to walk, breathe, swallow, and speak. Complications of muscular dystrophy can include: Breathing problems . Progressive weakness in the breathing muscles (diaphragm) makes it hard to take a breath. That raises the risk for lung infections such as pneumonia. Curving of the spine (scoliosis). Weakness in the muscles supporting the backbone causes the spine to become curved. Most people with Duchenne muscular dystrophy need scoliosis surgery. Heart problems. Some types of muscular dystrophy cause abnormal and dangerous changes in the heartbeat. You need a pacemaker to regulate it. Muscular dystrophy can also cause the heart muscle to become weak ( cardiomyopathy ). That leads to heart failure . Swallowing difficulty. Weakness affects the muscles in the esophagus , and causes problems with chewing and swallowing. This can lead to choking. Some people with muscular dystrophy will need a feeding tube . Shortening of the tendons or muscles around the joints (contractures). Bracing and tendon release surgery can help prevent some contractures. Vision problems. Some types of muscular dystrophy cause clouding of the eye lens ( cataracts ). Need for a wheelchair. Weakness in the large muscles of the legs makes it difficult to walk, stand, kneel, or climb. Some people with muscular dystrophy eventually need to use a wheelchair."
40,Healthy Eating Habits for Your Child,"By teaching your children healthy eating habits, and modeling these behaviors in yourself, you can help your children maintain a healthy weight and normal growth. Also, the eating habits your children pick up when they are young will help them maintain a healthy lifestyle when they are adults. Your child's health care provider can evaluate your child's weight, height and explain their BMI and let you know if your child needs to lose or gain weight or if any dietary changes need to be made. Some of the most important aspects of healthy eating are portion control and cutting down on how much fat and sugar your child eats or drinks. Simple ways to reduce fat intake in your child's diet and promote a healthy weight include serving: Low-fat or nonfat dairy products Poultry without skin Lean cuts of meats Whole grain breads and cereals Healthy snacks such as fruit and veggies Also, reduce the amount of sugar sweetened drinks and salt in your child's diet. If you are unsure about how to select and prepare a variety of foods for your family, consult a registered dietitian for nutrition counseling. It is important that you do not place your overweight child(ren) on a restrictive diet. Children should never be placed on a restrictive diet to lose weight unless a doctor supervises one for medical reasons. Other approaches parents can take to develop healthy eating habits in their children include: Guide your family's choices rather than dictate foods. Make a wide variety of healthful foods available in the house. This practice will help your children learn how to make healthy food choices. Leave the unhealthy choices like chips, soda, and juice at the grocery store. Serve water with meals. Encourage your children to eat slowly. A child can detect hunger and fullness better when they eat slowly. Before offering a second helping or serving, ask your child to wait at least 15 minutes to see if they are truly still hungry . This will give the brain time to register fullness. Also, that second helping should be much smaller than the first. And if possible, load that second helping with more veggies Eat meals together as a family as often as possible. Try to make mealtimes pleasant with conversation and sharing, not a time for scolding or arguing. If mealtimes are unpleasant, children may try to eat faster to leave the table as soon as possible. They then may learn to associate eating with stress. Involve your children in food shopping and preparing meals. These activities will give you hints about your children's food preferences, an opportunity to teach your children about nutrition , and provide your kids with a feeling of accomplishment. In addition, children may be more willing to eat or try foods that they help prepare. Plan for snacks. Continuous snacking may lead to overeating, but snacks that are planned at specific times during the day can be part of a nutritious diet, without spoiling a child's appetite at meal times. You should make snacks as nutritious as possible, without depriving your children of occasional chips or cookies, especially at parties or other social events. Have healthy snacks within reach and at eye level. Set some familiy goals. Perhaps restricting desserts to weekends and only having sodas on weekends. Making sure water bottles are empty before dinner time. to encourage hydration Discourage eating meals or snacks while watching TV. Try to eat only in designated areas of your home, such as the dining room or kitchen. Eating in front of the TV may make it difficult to pay attention to feelings of fullness, and may lead to overeating. Encourage your children to drink more water. Overconsumption of sweetened drinks and sodas has been linked to increased rates of obesity in children. Try not to use food to punish or reward your children. Withholding food as a punishment may lead children to worry that they will not get enough food. For example, sending children to bed without any dinner may cause them to worry that they will go hungry . As a result, children may try to eat whenever they get a chance. Similarly, when foods, such as sweets, are used as a reward, children may assume that these foods are better or more valuable than other foods. For example, telling children that they will get dessert if they eat all of their vegetables sends the wrong message about vegetables. Make sure your children's meals outside the home are balanced. Find out more about their school lunch program, or pack their lunch to include a variety of foods. Also, select healthier items when dining at restaurants. Pay attention to portion size and ingredients. Read food labels and limit foods with trans fat . Also, make sure you serve the appropriate portion as indicated on the label."
41,Baby Safety,"Your child's safety is your responsibility. The following tips should help you keep your baby out of harm's way from birth through their toddler years. Baby Safety in the Car Always use a federally approved car safety seat when traveling in a motor vehicle. Carefully read safety seat instructions, as well as instructions in your car's owner's manual, to ensure that the seat has been properly installed. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends buying a new car seat unless you’re sure a used seat has never been in an accident. NEVER carry your infant in your lap while you ride in a car. For the first 2 years of a baby's life, car seats should face the rear of the vehicle. The safest location for the car seat is the middle of the back seat. NEVER put the baby in the front passenger seat of cars, especially those with airbags. If you have a truck with no back seat, you should disengage the airbag while the baby's seat is in the car. Check the height and weight limits on your child’s car seat from time to time to be sure they haven’t outgrown it. You’ll also need to adjust the position of the harness straps as your baby gets bigger. If you have questions about safety seats, call the Auto Safety Hotline at 888-327-4236 (888-DASH-2-DOT). Or visit an NHTSA car seat inspection station . Often, they're located at fire stations. A certified technician will show you how to properly install and use your car seat. To minimize the risk that a child will accidentally be left behind in a car or get trapped inside: Leave a purse, briefcase, shoe, or cell phone in the back seat. That way, you get in the habit of checking in the back seat before leaving the vehicle. Make an arrangement with your child’s day care to have them call you if the child doesn’t show up as expected. Always lock your car and car trunk, even if the car is parked in the driveway at home, and always keep keys out of the reach of little ones. Preventing Baby Falls If you use an infant carrier, always place it on the floor, never on a counter or tabletop. Make sure the baby is always strapped in. Never leave your baby alone on a bed, couch, changing table, or infant seat from which they can fall or roll off. Even if looking away for a second, an accident can happen. Baby Safety, Smoking and Fire Safety Do not smoke and do not allow smoking around your baby. Even smoking “outside” is harmful for the baby because clothing, hair and skin still carry smoke particles. Install a working smoke alarm on every level of your home. Change the batteries of your smoke detectors every 6 months. Have at least one fire extinguisher on every level of your home. If your home uses gas heat, install a carbon monoxide detector. Preventing Baby Burns Do not hold hot liquids while holding your baby. To prevent burns, do not microwave your baby's bottle. Many microwaves heat unevenly, creating ""hot spots"" in your baby's formula that can burn your baby's mouth. Instead, warm the formula by running warm tap water over the bottle or submerging the bottle in a bowl of warm water. Shake the bottle well. Make sure you test the temperature on your hand or wrist before feeding it to your baby. Keep your hot water heater's thermostat at no higher than 120 degrees F. Consider installing anti-scald devices on faucets and shower heads. Preventing Baby Accidents Keep sharp objects (knives, scissors, tools, razors) and other hazardous items (coins, glass objects, beads, pins, medications ) in a secure place out of your baby's reach. NEVER shake a baby or throw your baby in the air. This can cause brain damage or blindness. Do not leave your baby alone with a young sibling or a pet, even when your baby is sleeping. Never put your child in a walker. They send thousands of kids to the emergency room every year, mainly by causing falls down stairs. Make sure that your baby cannot pull lamps or other electrical objects on top of themselves. Use electrical tape to secure electrical cords along baseboards. Remove tablecloths that can be pulled from the table. Make sure all drawers have stops so that your baby or toddler can't pull the drawer out on top of themselves. Attach furniture to the wall so the pieces don’t fall over the child. Avoid electronics on top of higher dressers or tables that can fall on the child. Baby Bathing Safety Always test the bath water to make sure it is not too hot before setting your baby in the water. Dipping your elbow in the water is a good way to test. Turn down your water heater to 120 F. Never leave your baby unattended in the bathtub or bath ring. It only takes a few seconds for a baby to drown. Store small appliances, such as hair dryers and radios, away from the water and bathing areas. Keep these appliances unplugged and out of reach when not in use. Baby Toy Safety Inspect your child's toys often. Be sure that toys are unbreakable, do not come apart, do not have small parts that could be chewed or broken off, and are not sharp. The pieces/toys should be larger than your baby's mouth . Use toy chests without lids or with supports that hold a lid open in any position. Be cautious with balloons to prevent choking. Baby Choking or Strangulation Prevention NEVER put strings or cords around your baby's neck (such as to hold a pacifier ) or near your baby's crib. Be cautious of strings or buttons on clothing; make sure they are not in danger of choking your baby. Secure cords on blinds and drapes out of reach to prevent accidental strangulation. Put away small objects -- even display items -- that can cause injury or choking if swallowed. Baby Feeding Safety Never prop up your baby's bottle and leave your baby unattended; your baby could choke. Do not put your baby to bed with a bottle. Avoid giving your child raw carrots, unpeeled apples, nuts, hard candies, and other foods that present a choking hazard. In a highchair, always use restraining straps that run around your child's waist and between their legs to keep them from sliding out. Baby Sleeping Safety All infants should be put down for sleep on their backs to reduce the risk for sudden infant death syndrome, also called SIDS. Give your baby a pacifier before they go to sleep . This reduces the chance of SIDS. Avoid soft bedding that might suffocate your baby, such as pillows, blankets, plush toys, and bumpers in the crib. Crib slats should be 2 3/8 inches apart or less so the baby’s head can't get trapped. Keep your baby's room at a moderate temperature and dress them in a way that they can't overheat. This also reduces the risk of SIDS. Share a bedroom with your newborn -- but not a bed. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that parents sleep in the same room, preferably for at least the first six months. Avoid devices marketed to reduce the risk of SIDS, such as sleep positioners. Nursing your baby and making sure that your baby gets all of the recommended vaccines can help protect against SIDS. Don’t nurse in a chair or on a couch if you feel you might fall asleep. If your baby falls asleep in a car seat, swing or carrier, try to remove them and lay them on a flat surface. Try to have skin-to-skin contact with your baby. Changing Table Safety Use a sturdy table. Always keep your hands and eyes on your baby while they are on the changing table. Keep supplies within easy reach. Babies and Pets Keep food and water bowls in an area your baby can’t reach. Same with the litterbox. Supervise your child’s interactions with your pets and teach them to be gentle. Hitting or tail-pulling can lead to bites and scratches. Don’t let your animals lick your baby’s face or skin, especially if they have a cut or scrape. Wash your child’s hands after they play with the dog or cat. Keep the pet toys out of your baby’s mouth. Most doctors say pets shouldn’t sleep in your child’s bed. Baby Crawling and Walking Safety When your baby becomes mobile, here are important tips to keep your baby safe around your home: Put electrical outlet covers on all outlets. Secure electrical cords to baseboards. Install safety gates securely in front of stairs and basement doors. Avoid gates with diamond-shaped slats, which provide footholds for climbing toddlers. Instead, use gates with straight, vertical slats, and a swinging door. Use doorknob covers to keep children away from rooms and other areas with hazards. Be careful, though, that these devices are easy for adults to use in case of emergency. Store cleaners and medications out of reach and in a locked cabinet, and always in their original containers. Never store toxic substances in bottles or jars that could be mistaken for food products. Install safety locks on cabinets. Turn pot and pan handles on the stove in and cook on the back burners whenever possible. Establish the area in front of the stove as off-limits while you are cooking. Keep the toilet lid down to prevent drowning and to keep the lid from slamming on your baby's head or hands. Consider installing toilet lid locks. Cushion hard edges and sharp corners of furniture. If possible, move sharp-edged pieces of furniture away from high traffic areas. Anchor down unsteady pieces of furniture, such as bookcases. Place furniture away from high windows so children won't climb onto windowsills. Screens aren't strong enough to keep children from falling through windows. Outdoor Safety If there is a swimming pool in your backyard or your neighborhood, make sure it is surrounded by a fence and has a gate that latches or locks. Better yet, never leave your child unattended when outdoors. Cover areas under and around backyard play sets with shock-absorbing material, such as sand, rubber, or mulch, 9-12 inches deep. During hot summer days, check the temperature of slides and swings. They can become hot enough to cause burns to the skin . Always supervise children on playground equipment. Watch for hazards like stair rungs where they can get stuck, missing guardrails, protruding bolts, or dangling ropes or cords. Teach your child to stay away from stray dogs and wild animals like squirrels and raccoons when you go to the park, and make sure they don’t get hold of animal droppings, which can carry germs. Keep your child away from moving machinery, including lawnmowers and overhead garage doors. Also, keep kids away from driveways and streets. Keep your baby in the shade, if possible. Their skin is thinner and more sensitive. Cover them up with clothes and a hat, limit their time in the sun (especially between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., when the sun is strongest), don’t let them get overheated, and get them out of the sun right away if they show any signs of sunburn or dehydration , including fussiness, redness, and excessive crying. Don’t put bug spray on babies younger than 2 months. Keep them inside when bugs are biting at dawn and dusk. Cover their skin with long sleeves and pants, and cover strollers with mesh netting. Get rid of standing water in your yard where mosquitoes breed, like planters and bird baths. After 2 months bug repellent is OK, but keep it off your baby’s hands and away from their mouth and eyes. Other Baby Safety Precautions Consider taking a certified CPR class if you are not already certified. You can find out about these classes from your local Red Cross or American Heart Association chapter. You may want to post a demonstration chart near your phone. Your baby's caregivers should be CPR-certified. Gather a list of emergency numbers and keep them by the phone. These numbers should include: your child's pediatrician, your health care provider, your family doctor, a 24-hour nurse-on-call number, the police department, the fire department, 911 reminder, and poison control. If a poison is swallowed, call the poison control center (throughout the USA, call 800-222-1222 -- American Association of Poison Control Centers.) Keep poisonous house plants out of reach. For information about which plants are poisonous, contact your local county extension office. Beware of any device that claims to help prevent SIDS. Home monitors, wedges and positioners remain unproven. Name a guardian for your child. In the unfortunate event that something happens to you or your spouse, it's a good idea to have a will that names a legal guardian and alternate guardian for your child. Without a will, the court may appoint a guardian you would not have chosen. Be sure to check with the individuals named in your will to make sure they are willing to serve as your child's guardian. In your will, you can also leave assets to your child in the form of a testamentary, or ""after death"" trust."
42,What Is Traditional Chinese Medicine?,"You may sometimes notice athletes or celebrities with purple circles on their skin from cupping. Or maybe you know someone who swears by acupuncture for their back pain or herbal teas for colds . More and more, people use practices like these from traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) to not only fight disease, but also prevent it. TCM is an ancient system of health and wellness that’s been used in China for thousands of years. Western medicine focuses mainly on treating disease. But TCM looks at your entire well-being. Is it safe to try and will it work? With a little background on how it’s used, you can make more informed choices to improve your health. What’s the Idea Behind TCM? Western medicine tends to view the body a lot like a car. It has different systems that need the right inputs and outputs. It’s very concrete and logical. TCM, on the other hand, doesn’t focus on science and medicine. Instead, it’s based on balance, harmony, and energy. There are two central ideas behind TCM: Qi: This is also called life energy or vital energy. The belief is that it runs throughout your body. It’s always on the move and constantly changes. TCM treatments often focus on ways to promote and maintain the flow of qi. Yin and Yang: These are opposites that describe the qualities of qi. Yin: night , dark, cold, feminine, negative Yang: day, light, warm , positive, male The belief is that everything in life has a little bit of its opposite, too, and balance is the key. For example, a drug from your doctor might heal disease. But it’s dangerous if you take too much of it. According to TCM, these ideas play out in our bodies. When you balance the yin and yang of Qi, you feel healthy and well. If they’re out of whack, you feel sick. TCM aims to create harmony and a healthy flow of qi. What Kind of Practices Does TCM Use? What Kind of Practices Does TCM Use? Several. They include: Acupuncture : very fine needles placed gently in the skin Cupping: heated cups that create suction on your skin Herbs: teas, powders, and capsules made mostly from plants Meditation : a way to sit quietly and calm your mind Moxibustion: dried herbs burned near the skin Tai chi : exercise with slow movements and focus on the breath Is It Safe? Experts believe it’s safe, if you go to someone who knows what they're doing. This is especially true of acupuncture, tai chi, cupping, and moxibustion. Herbs can be a little trickier. They don’t go through the same FDA process as drugs. That means there’s not as much research on them, and it can be hard to know exactly what’s in them. Plus, herbs can have side effects or impact other medicine you’re taking. Again, it’s important to go to someone who really understands their practice. And always check with your doctor first. Does It Work? TCM is an approach that covers a lot of ground, and results vary. The practices haven’t been studied in the same way as Western medicine. More research has been done on herbs and acupuncture than other treatments. But studies show a lot of promise: Acupuncture is commonly accepted as a treatment for a number of conditions, including pain relief and limiting side effects from chemotherapy . A number of herbs used in TCM are also used at well-respected, Western medicine clinics to treat anything from trouble sleeping to arthritis to menopause . Tai chi seems to improve balance in people with Parkinson’s disease. Cupping may help relieve pain from shingles . Who Should Use It? That’s a personal decision. People use TCM for anything from carpal tunnel syndrome to lowering stress. Sometimes they use it along with Western medicine. It may be a good choice if you: Have a lot of different symptoms with no clear cause Need to treat side effects from drugs Have tried Western medicine but didn’t get results Want to prevent illness Who Should Avoid TCM? In general, doctors suggest you don’t use it to totally replace Western medicine, especially if you have a serious condition like cancer or liver disease. They also urge caution, especially with herbs, if you’re: Elderly Pregnant or breastfeeding Scheduled for surgery (some herbs could lead to bleeding problems or prevent drugs used during surgery from working) Taking other medicine as well Treating a child What Do Traditional Doctors Think of TCM? They want to see proof that something is safe and works well before they suggest you try it. That often makes it hard for them to recommend TCM. But on the whole, research and interest in TCM is on the rise. You can also find many leading health care centers, like the Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic, and Johns Hopkins offering TCM practices such as acupuncture and herbal treatments. How Do I Find Someone Who Practices TCM? Your best bet is to find someone certified by the Accreditation Committee for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (ACAOM). They accredit schools that teach TCM, and you can check their website to find someone. Another option is to get in touch with a school of Oriental medicine. They can sometimes refer you to their alumni. Check with your family and friends as well -- just do your research to make sure you go to someone you can trust."
43,Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia,"What Is Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia? Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a cancer that affects a type of white blood cell called a ""lymphocyte."" Lymphocytes help your body fight infection. They're made in the soft center of your bones, called the marrow. If you have CLL, your body makes an abnormally high number of lymphocytes that aren't working right. More adults get CLL than any other type of leukemia. It usually grows slowly, so you may not have symptoms for years. Some people never need treatment, but if you do, it can slow the disease and ease symptoms. People who get medical care live longer today because doctors are diagnosing CLL earlier. It's natural to have worries and questions about any serious condition. You don't have to face things alone. Tell your friends and family about any concerns you have. Let them know how they can help. And talk to your doctor about how to join a support group. It can help to speak to people who understand what you're going through. Causes In most cases, doctors don't know what causes CLL. You're more likely to get it if: You have a parent, sibling, or child who has CLL. You're middle-aged or older. You're a white man. You have relatives who are either Eastern European or Russian Jews. If you were exposed to Agent Orange, an herbicide widely used during the Vietnam War, your chances of getting CLL may also be higher. Symptoms You may have no symptoms for a while. Over time, you may have: Swollen lymph nodes in your neck, armpits, stomach, or groin; lymph nodes are pea-sized glands in these and other areas of your body. Shortness of breath Pain or fullness in your stomach, which may be because the disease has made your spleen bigger Fatigue Night sweats Fever and infections Loss of appetite and weight Getting a Diagnosis If you have one or more swollen lymph nodes, your doctor may ask: Have you had any recent infections? Have you had a recent injury? Do you have an immune system disease? Have you had a fever? Are you short of breath? Have you lost weight without trying to? What medications do you take? Your doctor will give you a blood test if they think you may have CLL. The results show how many lymphocytes, platelets, and red and white cells are in your blood. If your white blood cell counts are high, you will get a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy: Aspiration: Your doctor inserts a thin, hollow needle into the bone (usually, your hip) to take out a small amount of liquid marrow. Biopsy: Your doctor uses a slightly larger needle to remove a small amount of bone, marrow, and blood. Your doctor will do both procedures during the same visit. By checking the samples under a microscope for abnormal cells, your doctor can tell if CLL is in your body and how fast it's moving. They can also learn more about the genetic changes in the cells. This information may help you and your doctor plan your treatment. Questions for Your Doctor What's the stage of my leukemia? Do I need treatment now? If not, how will we know when I need treatment? Will I need other tests before we decide? Should I get a second opinion? What are the side effects of treatment? How will it affect my daily life? What will we do if the leukemia returns? Treatment Some types of CLL grow very slowly. If yours is in the early stages or it’s not causing any problems, you probably don't need treatment. Studies show that it doesn't help. Even so, you should keep up with all your doctor visits. Your doctor will closely check to make sure your condition hasn't changed. You may start treatment if your doctor notices a change, like the number of lymphocytes in your blood goes up quickly, there’s a drop in the number of your red blood cells, or a lymph node is getting bigger. Your treatment may include: Chemotherapy (chemo). These are drugs that kill or control cancer cells. Doctors often combine two or more drugs that work in different ways. You may get chemo by pill, shot, or IV. The drugs travel through your blood to reach and affect cells that are dividing too quickly all over your body. This includes certain healthy cells as well as cancer cells. People usually get chemo in 3- to 4-week cycles that include a time of treatment and a time without treatment. This rest time gives your healthy cells time to rebuild and heal. Side effects can include mouth sores, nausea, and low blood counts. But you can recover from that. Almost all side effects go away over time after treatment ends. And most chemo side effects can be treated or even prevented. If you have very serious side effects, you can talk to your doctor about adjusting your treatment plan. Immunotherapy. These drugs help your body’s immune system recognize and destroy cancer cells. A type of immunotherapy called monoclonal antibodies is often used to treat CLL. They attach to certain proteins found on cancer cells and stimulate the immune system to destroy these cells. You get them through an IV or as a shot. Your doctor may give you this treatment on its own, but most people get it along with chemo. Immunotherapy drugs cause different side effects than chemo does. Headache, fever, rash, and blood pressure changes are just a few examples. Some can be prevented, and all can be treated. Targeted therapy. These drugs block certain proteins in and on cancer cells that help them survive and spread. They target proteins found in your CLL cells and spare healthy cells. These drugs are taken as pills. Side effects depend on which targeted therapy is used. They can include low blood counts, diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, and skin rashes. These can and should be treated. Most go away after treatment. Much less often, one of these treatments may be used: Radiation therapy. This type of treatment uses high-energy rays, such as X-rays, to destroy cancer cells. It may be used to shrink swelling in a lymph node or your spleen, or to treat bone pain. Surgery. It's very rare, but if chemo or radiation doesn't shrink an enlarged spleen, surgery may be done to take it out. This can help improve blood cell counts. Leukapheresis. If you have a very high number of CLL cells in your blood when you get diagnosed, your doctor may use this treatment to lower them quickly. Your blood passes through a special machine that filters out the CLL cells. This is a short-term fix and you’ll need other treatment, like chemo or immunotherapy, to keep the cancer cells under control. Clinical trials often offer other treatment options. These are research studies that scientists use to find better ways to treat diseases. They may be a way to try new treatments before they’re available to everyone. You always get at least the best available treatment in a clinical trial, but you may also get what the doctors think may be a new promising way to treat CLL. Your doctor can help you look for a trial and understand what’s involved, so you can decide if it’s an option you want to try. Stem cell transplants. Researchers are studying new combinations of drugs and new ways of treating CLL to help people stay disease-free longer. One such treatment combines chemotherapy with a stem cell transplant. Most people don’t need this treatment for CLL. Chemotherapy destroys cancer cells but also damages some healthy cells in the bone marrow. The stem cell transplant supplies healthy young cells to help rebuild your immune system. These aren't the ""embryonic"" stem cells that you may have heard about. They usually come from a donor's bone marrow. Close relatives, such as your brother or sister, are the best chance for a good match. If that doesn't work out, you need to get on a list of potential donors from strangers. Sometimes the best chance for the right stem cells for you will be from someone who has the same racial or ethnic background as you. Before the transplant, you'll likely need to get treated with high doses of chemo for about a week or two. This can be a tough process because you may get side effects like nausea and mouth sores. When the high-dose chemo is done, you'll start the transplant. The new stem cells are given to you through an IV. You won't feel any pain from this, and you'll be awake while it's happening. After your transplant, it could take 2 to 6 weeks for the stem cells to multiply and start making new blood cells. During this time, you may be in the hospital, or at the very least, will need to make visits every day to get checked by your transplant team. It can take 6 months to a year until the number of normal blood cells in your body gets back to what it should be. Taking Care of Yourself CLL treatment can cause side effects such as nausea and fatigue in some people. If it happens to you, let your doctor know, so you can manage the problems. Ask your doctor about anti-nausea drugs. Therapeutic massage and acupuncture may also help control nausea and vomiting. Try walking, restorative yoga, breathing exercises, and meditation to curb fatigue and boost energy. On days when your energy and mood are low, set one small goal for the day. Take a walk, talk with a friend, or take a relaxing shower. What You Can Expect CLL often grows slowly. With good care, you can live well with it for many years. Discuss all the treatment options with your doctor, find out about clinical trials, and get support from friends and family. Getting Support The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society has resources that can help you deal with different aspects of CLL, from financial to emotional issues. These resources include local education programs, support groups, online chats, and one-on-one support from someone who has been through it."
44,Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML),"Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is a cancer that affects your blood cells and bone marrow -- the soft part inside your bones where blood cells are made. You may also hear your doctor call it chronic myeloid leukemia. It's the same disease, just a different name. With treatment, you may go into what's called "" remission ."" For most people, that doesn't mean the cancer is completely gone, but it's less active than before. You can be in remission for many years. CML usually happens when you're middle-aged or older. The symptoms tend to come on gradually. Many of them can also be signs of other illnesses. For instance, you might feel tired, lose weight when you're not trying to, or sometimes get a fever. The disease starts with a problem in the genes of your blood cells. Sections of two different chromosomes switch places and make a new abnormal one. This new chromosome leads your body to make white blood cells that don't work as they should. They're called leukemia cells, and when they show up in your bloodstream, there's less room for healthy blood cells. Causes Most people will never know what caused them to get CML. You don't typically get it from your parents or from infections. Your smoking habits and diet don't seem to raise your chance of getting it either. The only known risk is if you've been in contact with high levels of radiation. Symptoms CML has three phases: chronic, accelerated, and blastic. Your symptoms depend on which one you're in. Chronic phase. It's the earliest stage and the easiest to treat. You might not even have symptoms. Accelerated phase. During this period, the number of blood cells that don't work right increases. You're more likely to get some of these symptoms: Feel very tired Have a fever Get bruises Have night sweats Be short of breath Lose some weight Feel less hungry Get swelling or pain on your left side (which could be a sign of an enlarged spleen ) Feel pain in your bones Other symptoms may include stroke, changes in your vision, ringing in your ears, you feel like you're in a daze, and you get prolonged erections. Blastic phase. The leukemia cells multiply and crowd out healthy blood cells and platelets. In this stage, you'll have more severe symptoms, including: Infections Bleeding Skin changes including bumps, tumors Swollen glands Bone pain Getting a Diagnosis If you have symptoms, your doctor will want to know: What problems have you noticed? How long have your symptoms been happening? Do your symptoms come and go or are they constant? What makes you feel better or worse? Are you taking any medication? Your doctor may do more tests to confirm the diagnosis, such as: Complete blood count. It's a blood test that checks to see how many white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets you have. Bone marrow test. It helps you figure out how advanced your cancer is. Your doctor uses a needle to take a sample, usually from your hip bone. FISH test (fluorescence in situ hybridization). It's a detailed lab test of your genes. Ultrasound or CT scans. They can check the size of your spleen. Ultrasounds use sound waves to make images that doctors and other medical professionals can read. A CT is an X-ray that takes a series of pictures inside your body. Polymerase chain reaction test. It's a lab test that looks for the BCR-ABL gene, which is involved in the process that tells your body to make too many of the wrong kind of white blood cells. Questions for Your Doctor Have you treated someone with CML before? What tests should I take to confirm a diagnosis? What phase of CML am I in? What treatment do you recommend for me? How will the therapy make me feel? What if the treatment doesn't work? How do I find a support group? Treatment The goal of your treatment is to destroy the leukemia blood cells in your body and restore healthy ones to a normal level. It's usually not possible to get rid of all the bad cells. If you get treatment during the early, chronic phase of CML, it can help prevent the disease from moving to a more serious level. Doctors usually give drugs known as tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) first. They slow down the rate at which your body makes leukemia cells. Some TKIs that are commonly used include: Bosutinib ( Bosulif) Dasatinib ( Sprycel ) Imatinib ( Gleevec ) Nilotinib ( Tasigna ) You may get bosutinib (Bosulif) and ponatinib ( Iclusig ) if other drugs don't help or make you too sick. If your disease continues to get worse after you've used two or more TKIs, your doctor may suggest either asciminib (Scemblix) or omacetaxine mepesuccinate ( Synribo ). Other CML treatment options include chemotherapy and biologic therapy, which uses a medication called interferon to help stir up action in your immune system -- your body's defense against germs. A stem cell transplant might cure some patients. It's a complicated procedure that's usually done only when your other treatments aren't working. Stem cells are in the news a lot, but usually when you hear about them they're referring to ""embryo"" stem cells that are used in cloning. The stem cells in a stem cell transplant are different. These are cells that live in your bone marrow and help make new blood cells. When you get a stem cell transplant, a donor will supply the new stem cells. You'll need to get on a waiting list to find a donor who is the right match you so that your body doesn't ""reject"" them. Close relatives, such as your brother or sister, are the best chances for a good match. If that doesn't work out, you need to get on a list of potential donors from strangers. Sometimes the best odds for the right stem cells for you will be from someone who is in the same racial or ethnic group as you. Self-Care Make sure you tell your doctor about any medicines you take. Some don't mix well with the treatments for CML. Follow your doctor's treatment plan, eat healthy, and exercise when you feel up to it. What to Expect CML is often a slow-growing form of cancer. Although it's hard to get rid of completely, many people live long lives with it. Once you're diagnosed, you should see a hematologist-oncologist, a doctor with special training in blood diseases, especially cancer. They'll come up with a treatment plan for you. Always feel free to get a second opinion from another doctor if you feel you want one. Getting Support Make sure you reach out to your family and friends for the emotional backing you need. They can be a huge help as you manage your disease. It also helps to talk to others who have CML. Ask your doctor about how to join a support group, where you can meet people who are going through the same things you are. The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society can help you find services and support. It has up-to-date information about treating and living with CML, including help for caregivers."
45,What Is Galactosemia?,"Breast milk is full of good things that babies need -- key nutrients, hormones, and antibodies that protect them from disease and keep them healthy. But some babies are born with galactosemia . It’s a rare metabolic condition that prevents them from processing galactose (one of the sugars in breast milk and formula ) and turning it into energy. The disorder can cause many problems for newborns and can be life-threatening if left untreated. It’s easy to test for galactosemia. It’s also simple to treat once it’s diagnosed. And children who have it can live normal lives. What Causes It? Galactosemia is hereditary. Both parents must pass it down for their child to get it. If your baby has this condition, it means the genes that produce the enzymes to break down galactose into glucose (a sugar ) are missing key parts. Without these parts, the genes can’t tell the enzymes to do their job. This causes galactose to build up in the blood , creating problems, especially for newborns. There are three main types of galactosemia: Classic (type I) Galactokinase deficiency (type II) Galactose epimerase deficiency (type III) Type I occurs in about 1 in every 30,000 to 60,000 people. Type II and type III are less common. As a parent or potential parent, you and your partner can be genetically screened for galactosemia. If you’re a carrier , it doesn’t mean you have to avoid galactose. But it means you can pass galactosemia along to your children if your partner is also a carrier. Symptoms If your newborn has classic galactosemia, they’ll appear normal at birth. Symptoms start to show up within a few days after they begin to drink breast milk or formula with lactose -- the milk sugar that contains galactose. Your baby first loses their appetite and starts vomiting . Then they get jaundice , a yellowing of the skin and the whites of their eyes . Diarrhea is common, too. The disease leads to severe weight loss and your baby struggles to grow and thrive. Without treatment, over time your child may develop cataracts and can be susceptible to infections. They may have liver damage and kidney problems. Their brain may not mature well. That can cause developmental disabilities . Some children have issues with their motor skills and muscles. For girls, it can cause their ovaries to stop working. Most with this condition can’t have children. Testing and Treatment Every baby born at a U.S. hospital is given what’s called a newborn screening . A blood sample is taken from a heel stick (a tiny cut in the baby’s foot ) and it is tested for several conditions. Galactosemia is one of them. If your baby shows signs of the illness, your doctor will suggest a follow-up test to confirm. This test will include both a blood and urine sample. If your child has galactosemia, your doctor will work with you to plan a diet. Lactose and galactose are taken out of their diet. Instead, they’re given soy-based formula and must avoid milk or milk byproducts. Your doctor will likely refer your child to a specialist. Though a person with galactosemia will never be able to process this type of sugar, they can live normal lives if the disease is caught early enough. Along with eliminating dairy, your doctor may recommend cutting out some fruits, vegetables, and candies that contain galactose. In addition, your child may need to take vitamin and mineral supplements such as calcium , vitamin C , vitamin D , and vitamin K . Some babies have a form of the condition called Duarte galactosemia (DG), which is milder than the classic form (type I). Babies with DG may have some issues processing galactose but a recent showed that changing the diet change may not be necessary and most babies do fine continuing breastfeeding or continuing formula with galactose.. Babies with type II or type III also will have fewer issues than babies with classic galactosemia. However, they still can develop cataracts , kidney and liver issues, and have delayed growth. Girls with galactosemia may require hormone treatment when they reach puberty . It’s important that parents of a child with galactosemia work with a health care team to find ways to help them live with the condition and its effects on their daily life."
46,What Is Pfeiffer Syndrome?,"Pfeiffer syndrome is a rare birth defect that affects the shape of a baby’s skull and face. When you’re born, the top of your skull isn’t one solid piece. It’s actually made up of several bones with special joints between them. This allows it to expand so your brain has room to grow. Normally, the skull bones come together only after your head reaches its full size. But with this syndrome, the plates join together too early. The skull can’t expand as the brain grows, which affects the shape of the head and face. There are three types of Pfeiffer syndrome. All of them affect a child’s appearance, but types 2 and 3 are more severe. They can cause delays in development, as well as other issues with the brain and nervous system . Treatment starts soon after birth. Because the condition varies among people, the right care depends on your child’s signs and symptoms. What Causes It? Pfeiffer syndrome is caused by a glitch in the genes that control how certain cells grow and die. It can be passed from a parent to child, but in most cases, the parents don’t have the syndrome. The baby’s genes have a change that seems to happen out of the blue. What Are the Symptoms? They vary based on the type and how severe it is. It can affect the head and face, fingers and toes, and a number of other areas. Head and face: Signs of it often show most clearly here. This is partly because the skull can’t expand as it typically does. But Pfeiffer syndrome also affects bones in the mid-face, from the eyes to the mouth , which don’t grow as far forward as usual. When your child has the condition, you might see: A beaked-shaped nose Crowded, crooked teeth Eyes that appear larger and set wider apart than normal A head that’s short from front to back A high forehead A very small upper jaw Fingers and Toes: It’s also common for children to have: Short fingers and toes Thumbs and big toes that are wider than normal and bend away from the other fingers and toes Webbed fingers and toes Other Problems: More than half of children have hearing loss . Some also have: Dental problems Acid reflux Sleep apnea (when you briefly stop breathing or take shallow breath many times a night) Vision problems Types 2 and 3 Children with Pfeiffer syndrome types 2 and 3 often have delayed development and other issues with the brain and nervous system . Without early treatment, they’re also more likely to have life-threatening health problems. Diagnosis A doctor can often tell whether your child has Pfeiffer syndrome from a physical exam as they check the skull, thumbs, and big toes. To make sure it’s Pfeiffer and not something else, your doctor may also order: X-rays or imaging, like a CT scan , to check the skull Genetic tests (taking a blood or saliva sample to check for the gene glitch that causes it) Treatments Your child's treatment depends on the signs and symptoms. You might need a team of specialists that includes doctors, surgeons, psychologists, speech and language therapists, and more. Surgery tends to play a key role in treatment. Skull surgery: Most children have the first surgery to reshape their skull before they’re 18 months old. For children under 3 months, this can be done with very small openings in the head. For older children, doctors use traditional surgery. Typically, children will need two to four skull surgeries over the course of their lives. Midface surgery: Some children may need it to correct problems in their jaw and bring their midface bones forward. Children are usually at least 6 before this surgery is done. Treatment for breathing problems : Some children have blockages that make it hard for them to breathe. This leads to problems such as sleep apnea . To correct these problems, your doctor may suggest these: Your child can wear a special mask while sleeping. It’s called a “continuous positive airway pressure mask” -- CPAP for short. This is a standard treatment for sleep apnea. Midface surgery can help remove blockages. A surgeon can remove the tonsils or adenoids (tissues in the back of the nose that help fight infection). For severe cases, doctors may do a surgery called a tracheostomy . The doctor creates an opening in the child’s neck directly to the windpipe to allow for easier breathing. It’s done for children too young to have other surgeries to correct breathing problems. Other treatments: Your child may also need: Dental work to help with issues such as an underbite and teeth that are out of position Surgery to correct finger and toe problems Therapy to help with speech and language learning"
47,How Should I Clean a Wound?,"If you or your child gets a cut, scrape, or burn, it’s important to clean the wound properly right away to prevent infection. Here’s how to do it in five easy steps. Step 1. Wash Your Hands Clean your hands using soap and water or hand sanitizer, then put on disposable gloves, if possible. Do this before you touch your wound or treat someone else’s burn, cut, or scrape. Clean, covered hands help prevent infections. Step 2. Apply Gentle Pressure This step applies only if the wound is bleeding. Skip this step for burns. Use a clean cloth or sterile gauze to gently press on the wound until bleeding stops (small cuts and scrapes may not require pressure). Elevate (raise) the affected part, if possible. If blood oozes through the cloth or gauze, leave the covering on the wound. Place another clean piece on top and continue to apply pressure. Seek medical attention right away if: The wound is on a child under a year old Bleeding is severe or doesn’t stop with gentle pressure Your wound has jagged edges The cut is deep, gaping, or across a joint The wound was caused by a dirty object or was the result of a projectile or something impaling the skin The wound was caused by a human or animal bite The wound happened on the face or genital area Stitches are usually needed for cuts longer than ½ inch. If you have a cut on your face that’s ¼ inch or longer, a doctor may close it with surgical glue or sutures. Step 3. Rinse with Water You don’t need hydrogen peroxide or iodine products to thoroughly clean a simple cut or scrape. Just follow these steps: Rinse the wound in clear water to loosen and remove dirt and debris. Use a soft washcloth and mild soap to clean around the wound. Don’t place soap in the wound. That can hurt and cause irritation. Use tweezers to remove any dirt or debris that still appears after washing. Clean the tweezers first with isopropyl alcohol. Don’t pick at the wound. If the wound can’t be cleaned, call a doctor. If you have a burn, rinse the area under cool (not cold) water for 10 to 15 minutes. Or, place a cool cloth on the burn for the same length of time. See your doctor if any large blisters form. Go to the emergency room right away if you have any major burns. Step 4. Use an Antibiotic Cream or Ointment Over-the-counter skin antibiotics , like Neosporin or Polysporin , help keep the skin moist and ward off infection. It’s not always necessary to use these if you have a minor cut or scrape. But applying a thin layer can boost your body’s natural healing process and reduce scarring. Doctors may recommend using a topical antibiotic if you have burn blisters that break open. Some people are allergic to certain ingredients in these products. Stop using the cream or ointment if a rash appears. Step 5. Bandage the Wound -- Sometimes You don’t need to bandage every boo-boo. If you have a minor scrape or cut, clean it and leave it alone. Otherwise, place a clean, sterile, nonstick bandage on the wound after cleaning it. This helps keep out germs. You can find a variety of bandages and tape at your local drugstore. Paper tape may be less irritating to sensitive skin. Change the bandage at least once a day or when it's wet or dirty. Be extra careful to cover any cuts or wounds on areas that tend to get dirty or germy, like your hands or feet. You also want to bandage any wound that would rub on clothing, such as a cut on your knee . Always cover large wounds. After You Clean the Wound Don’t pick at any scabs -- they’re part of the healing process. Picking at them can leave a scar. Call your doctor if you notice any of the following symptoms. They could mean the wound is infected: Increased redness or swelling Pain that gets worse Skin around the wound feels warm Unpleasant odor when cleaning the wound Unusual or increased drainage Fever or chills If you have a burn, or a wound that breaks the skin, check with your doctor to see if you need a tetanus booster."
48,Cleft Lip and Cleft Palate,"What Are Cleft Lip and Cleft Palate? Cleft lip and cleft palate are facial and oral differences that occur very early in pregnancy, while the fetus is developing inside the uterus. When the tissues in the mouth or lip area are not enough and fail to join together properly, it results in clefting. A cleft lip is a physical split or separation of the two sides of the upper lip and appears as a narrow opening or gap in the skin of the upper lip. This separation often extends beyond the base of the nose and includes the bones of the upper jaw and/or upper gum. A cleft palate is a split or opening in the roof of the mouth. A cleft palate can involve the hard palate (the bony front portion of the roof of the mouth) and/or the soft palate (the soft back portion of the roof of the mouth). Cleft lip and cleft palate can occur on one or both sides of the mouth. Because the lip and the palate develop separately, it is possible to have a cleft lip without a cleft palate, a cleft palate without a cleft lip, or both conditions together. Cleft Palate and Cleft Lip Risk Factors Who gets cleft lip and cleft palate? About 1 out of every 2,800 babies in the U.S. are born with a cleft lip. Around 1 in 1,600 have both cleft lip and palate. Clefts affect more children of Asian/Pacific, Latinx, or Native American descent than children of other races. Cleft lip, with or without cleft palate, affects twice as many babies assigned male at birth as those assigned female. But cleft palate is more common in females. Is cleft lip genetic? Scientists say that a combination of genes and environment causes cleft lip and palate. A newborn is more likely to have these facial changes if one of their parents or a brother or sister has it. But most children with cleft lip and palate don't have any relatives with this condition. Cleft lip and palate can be part of genetic conditions such as Stickler syndrome and 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (or DiGeorge syndrome). Children with these conditions may have other facial and body differences, too. Some babies inherit a gene that makes them more likely to get cleft lip and palate. Triggers in the environment, such as exposure to certain chemicals in the womb, can also cause the condition. Cleft Lip and Palate Causes In most cases, the cause of cleft lip and cleft palate is unknown. These conditions can't be prevented. Most scientists believe clefts are due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. There appears to be a greater chance of clefting in a newborn if a sibling, parent, or relative has had the problem. Another potential cause may be related to a medication a mother may have taken during pregnancy. Some drugs that may cause cleft lip and cleft palate include anti-seizure/anticonvulsant drugs, acne drugs containing Accutane, and methotrexate, a drug commonly used for treating cancer, arthritis , and psoriasis. Cleft lip and cleft palate may also occur as a result of exposure to viruses or chemicals while the fetus is developing in the womb. In other situations, cleft lip and cleft palate may be part of another medical condition. Cleft Palate and Cleft Lip Symptoms Babies with a cleft palate may have more trouble eating from the bottle or breast because the roof of their mouth isn't fully formed. Food or liquid may come out of their nose when they try to eat. Other symptoms include: Delayed speech or trouble speaking Ear infections Hearing loss Missing, crooked, or small teeth Teeth and jaws that don't line up evenly Cleft Lip and Palate Diagnosis An ultrasound during pregnancy can sometimes show a cleft lip, with or without cleft palate. The doctor can confirm the diagnosis with an exam after the baby is born. But a small cleft lip or palate may not be noticeable until your baby has trouble feeding, or later in life. Prenatal ultrasound An ultrasound is a test that uses sound waves to make pictures of your unborn baby. Doctors usually perform ultrasounds twice during pregnancy, once in the first trimester and again around 18-20 weeks into pregnancy. The doctor should be able to see differences in the structure of your baby's face on an ultrasound between 11 and 13 weeks. Cleft lip and palate are easier to see as the fetus develops. An ultrasound can often show a cleft lip alone or a cleft lip and palate at about 16 weeks into pregnancy. A cleft palate alone or a partial cleft lip may not show up on this imaging test. If your baby has signs of a cleft lip or palate on ultrasound, the doctor may take a sample of your amniotic fluid to test for other inherited genetic disorders. It's not easy to diagnose cleft lip and palate while the fetus is growing in the womb. It's easier to diagnose by looking at a newborn's mouth, nose, and palate. Your newborn may also have tests to find other physical changes. What Problems Are Associated With Cleft Lip and/or Palate? Eating problems. With a separation or opening in the palate, food and liquids can pass from the mouth back into the nose. Fortunately, specially designed baby bottles and nipples that help keep fluids flowing downward toward the stomach are available. Children with a cleft palate may need to wear a man-made palate to help them eat properly and ensure that they are receiving adequate nutrition until surgical treatment is provided. Ear infections/hearing loss. Children with cleft palate are at increased risk of ear infections since they are more prone to fluid buildup in the middle ear. If left untreated, ear infections can cause hearing loss. To prevent this from happening, children with cleft palate usually need special tubes placed in the eardrums to aid fluid drainage, and their hearing needs to be checked once a year. Speech problems. Children with cleft lip or cleft palate may also have trouble speaking. These children's voices don't carry well, as their voice may take on a nasal sound and their speech may be difficult to understand. Not all children have these problems, and surgery may fix these issues entirely for some. For others, a special doctor called a speech pathologist will work with the child to resolve speech difficulties. Dental problems. Children with clefts are more prone to cavities and often have missing, extra, malformed, or displaced teeth requiring dental and orthodontic treatments. In addition, children with cleft palate often have an alveolar ridge defect. The alveolus is the bony upper gum that contains teeth. A defect in the alveolus can (1) displace, tip, or rotate permanent teeth, (2) prevent permanent teeth from appearing, and (3) prevent the alveolar ridge from forming. These problems can usually be repaired through oral surgery. Who Treats Children With Cleft Lip and/or Palate? Due to the number of oral health and medical problems associated with a cleft lip or cleft palate, a team of doctors and other specialists is usually involved in the care of these children. Members of a cleft lip and palate team typically include: A plastic surgeon to evaluate and perform necessary surgeries on the lip and/or palate An otolaryngologist (an ear, nose, and throat doctor) to evaluate hearing problems and consider treatment options for hearing problems An oral surgeon to reposition segments of the upper jaw to improve function and appearance, if needed, and to repair the cleft of the gum An orthodontist to straighten and reposition teeth A dentist to perform routine dental care A prosthodontist to make artificial teeth and dental appliances to improve the appearance and to meet functional requirements for eating and speaking A speech pathologist to assess speech and feeding problems A speech therapist to work with the child to improve speech An audiologist (a specialist in communication disorders stemming from a hearing impairment) to assess and monitor hearing A nurse coordinator to provide ongoing supervision of the child's health A social worker/psychologist to support the family and assess any adjustment problems A geneticist to help parents and adult patients understand the chances of having more children with these conditions The health care team works together to develop a plan of care to meet the individual needs of each patient. Treatment usually begins in infancy and often continues through early adulthood. What’s the Treatment for Cleft Lip and Cleft Palate? Treatments for cleft lip and palate help your child eat and speak better. Doctors treat cleft lip and palate with surgery. Other treatments help with problems such as eating and speech that cleft lip and palate can cause. Cleft lip surgery Cleft lip repair involves one or two surgeries, depending on the size of the cleft. The first surgery happens when the baby is 3-6 months old. While your baby is asleep and pain-free, the surgeon closes the opening in their lip. Cleft palate surgery Surgery to close a cleft palate happens during the baby's first year. The surgeon closes the opening in the palate and rebuilds the roof of the baby's mouth. Special tubes may go into the child's ears to drain fluid and prevent hearing loss. Many children with a cleft palate will need a few procedures as they grow. Some may need a bone graft between ages 6 and 10 to support their teeth and jaw. Other surgeries improve the look of the lip and nose, close openings between the mouth and nose, help with breathing, and straighten the jaws and teeth. Some children will not have their last surgery until the teen years once their face has grown. Other treatments Your child's doctor may suggest one or more of these treatments to fix complications from a cleft lip and palate: Braces to straighten the teeth Ear tubes and other treatments for ear infections Feeding therapy Hearing aids Speech therapy Talk therapy to manage the stress of living with cleft lip and palate What Is the Outlook for Children With Cleft Lip and/or Cleft Palate? Treatment for a cleft lip and cleft palate can take many years and involve several surgeries. But most children with this condition can have a normal childhood and life. A team of doctors and other health care providers will manage your child's care. Some children may feel stressed by the surgeries or get self-conscious about the way they look. A psychologist, therapist, or other mental health care provider can help your child deal with the emotional impact of their condition. You can also find resources and support from organizations such as the American Cleft Palate Craniofacial Association (ACPA). Dental Care for Children With Cleft Lips and/or Palates Generally, the preventive and restorative dental care needs of children with clefts are same as those of other children. However, children with cleft lip and cleft palate may have special problems related to missing, malformed, or malpositioned teeth that require close monitoring. Early dental care. Like other children, children born with cleft lip and cleft palate require proper cleaning, good nutrition, and fluoride treatment to have healthy teeth. Appropriate cleaning with a small, soft-bristled toothbrush should begin as soon as teeth erupt. If a soft children's toothbrush will not adequately clean the teeth because of the modified shape of the mouth and teeth, your dentist may recommend a toothette. It is a soft, mouthwash-containing sponge on a handle that's used to swab teeth. Many dentists recommend that the first dental visit be scheduled at about 1 year of age or even earlier if there are special dental problems. Routine dental care can begin around 1 year of age. Orthodontic care. A first orthodontic appointment may be scheduled before a child has any teeth. The purpose of this appointment is to assess facial growth, especially jaw development. After teeth erupt, an orthodontist can further assess a child's short and long-term dental needs. After the permanent teeth erupt, orthodontic treatment can be applied to align the teeth. Prosthodontic care. A prosthodontist is a member of the cleft palate team. They may make a dental bridge to replace missing teeth or make special appliances called ""speech bulbs"" or ""palatal lifts"" to help close the passage between the nose and the mouth so that speech sounds more normal. The prosthodontist coordinates treatment with the oral or plastic surgeon and speech pathologist. Takeaways Cleft lip and cleft palate are facial differences that sometimes happen as a fetus develops in the womb. Your doctor can diagnose these changes during an ultrasound or with an exam after your baby is born. Surgery is the main way to treat cleft lip and palate, and most children will need many surgeries as they grow. Cleft Palate and Cleft Lip FAQs How common is cleft lip? About 1 out of every 2,800 babies in the U.S. are born with cleft lip. Around 1 in 1,600 babies have both cleft lip and cleft palate. What foods cause cleft lip? No foods directly cause cleft lip. If your child has these facial differences, it's probably not from anything in your diet. But this condition is slightly more likely to affect babies whose mothers drink alcohol, don't get enough folic acid, or are obese during their pregnancy. How can you prevent cleft lip and palate during pregnancy? You can't always prevent cleft lip and palate, but you can lower your risk. Take a multivitamin that contains 400 micrograms (mcg) of folic acid every day in the months before your pregnancy. During pregnancy, increase folic acid to 600 mcg a day. Don't drink alcohol or smoke while you're pregnant. When is cleft palate detected? A prenatal ultrasound can detect cleft lip and palate by around week 16 of pregnancy. A cleft palate alone may not show up on an ultrasound. A doctor can diagnose it with an exam after your child is born."
49,What Is Chordoma?,"Chordoma is a kind of cancer that grows in the bones of your skull and spine. It's very rare. Only 1 out of every 1 million people gets it. About 300 people are diagnosed with chordoma in the United States each year. You can get it at any age -- even in childhood. But most people are diagnosed between ages 40 and 70. Men get it more often than women. Chordomas can form anywhere in your back, neck, or skull. Many grow in the bottom of your spine or at the base of your skull. From there, they can spread to other organs, like your lungs . But they usually grow slowly. Because they're close to important areas like the brain and spinal cord, they need to be treated very carefully. Causes In the womb, a baby has a thin bar called a notochord that runs along their back. This bar supports the bones of the spine as they grow. The notochord disappears before the baby is born. In a small number of people, some of the notochord cells are left behind in the spine and skull. Doctors believe chordoma starts because of a change in the gene that carries instructions for making a protein that helps the spine form. This change causes notochord cells that are left in the brain or spinal cord to divide too quickly. This change usually happens randomly -- no one in your family has to have chordoma for you to get it. But it can run in families in rare instances. Symptoms Chordomas can press on nerves in your spine or brain . This can cause pain , numbness, or weakness. Your symptoms depend on where the cancer is and how big it is. Chordoma in the skull causes symptoms like: Abnormal eye movements Changes to your voice or speech Double vision Headache Loss of feeling and movement in your face Neck pain Trouble swallowing Chordoma of the spine causes symptoms like: Loss of control over your bowels Lump in the lower part of your back Numbness, tingling, or weakness in your arms or legs Pain in your lower back Problems controlling your bladder Sometimes, chordomas in the brain can block the flow of fluid there and in the spine. The fluid can build up and put pressure on the brain. This is called hydrocephalus . Diagnosis Your doctor can do imaging tests to see where the cancer is inside your body and how big it's grown. These include: X-ray: Low doses of radiation are used to make images of your brain or spinal cord. CT (computed tomography) scan: X-rays are taken from several different angles and put together to make detailed pictures of the affected area. MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): Powerful magnets and radio waves are used to make pictures of organs and other structures inside your body. A biopsy is the only test that can confirm you have chordoma. Your doctor will use a needle to take a small sample of cells from the tumor. A specialist will look at the cells under a microscope to see what kind of tumor you have. Your doctor might also do a blood test, a CT scan of your lungs , or a bone scan to see if the tumor has spread. Treatment Your treatment will depend on: Your age Your health Size of the tumor Where the tumor is Often, doctors remove the tumor with surgery. Taking out as much of the tumor as possible and some of the tissue around it can stop it from coming back. Sometimes surgeons can't remove the whole tumor because they might damage healthy cells in your brain or spine. Radiation -- high energy X-rays -- can kill any cancer cells that are left behind after surgery. This lowers the chance that the cancer will return. Still, chordoma often comes back after treatment. During the first year after your surgery, your doctor will check you with an MRI about once every 3 months to make sure it hasn't. If it does come back, you might need another surgery. Researchers are studying several new treatments for chordoma. They test these in clinical trials to see if they're safe and if they work. These are often a way for people to try a new therapy that isn't available to everyone. Your doctor can tell you if there's a trial that might be a good fit for you."
50,The Facts and Fiction of Cloning,"Cloning . More than ever, the word stirs emotion and triggers debate, as what was once science fiction becomes scientific fact. Just what are researchers working on and why? Do we have anything to gain, or to lose, from their continued efforts? For the first time, researchers have successfully cloned a human embryo -- and have extracted stem cells , the body's building blocks, from the embryo. Stem cells are considered one of the greatest hopes for curing diseases like diabetes, Parkinson's disease, and paralysis caused by spinal cord injury. What Is Cloning? Before you decide where you stand on this debate, you'll need to understand where the science is today. To put it all in perspective, WebMD asked some renowned scientists to explain precisely what cloning is and what it isn't. Popular depictions -- from the ominous hordes of worker drones in the futuristic novel Brave New World to Michael Keaton's comic time-saving duplicates in the film Multiplicity -- have almost nothing to do with reality. ""Clones are genetically identical individuals,"" says Harry Griffin, PhD. ""Twins are clones."" Griffin is assistant director of the Roslin Institute -- the lab in Edinburgh, Scotland, where Dolly the cloned sheep was created in 1997. Usually, after sperm and egg meet, the fertilized cell begins dividing. Remaining in a clump, the one becomes two, then four, eight, 16, and so on. These cells become increasingly specialized to a particular function and organize into organs and systems. Eventually, it's a baby. Sometimes, though, after the first division, the two cells split apart. They continue dividing separately, growing to become two individuals with the exact same genetic make-up -- identical twins, or clones. This phenomenon, though not entirely understood, is far from unusual. We've all known identical twins. Early on, says Griffin, the term cloning referred to embryo splitting -- doing in the lab what happens in the woman's body to create identical twins. ""It was first done in cattle, but there are one or two human examples."" Those human embryos were never implanted, he says. ""Twins were not deliberately created, but they certainly could be."" When we speak of cloning nowadays, however, we're referring not to embryo splitting, but to a process called nuclear transfer. ""The importance is that with nuclear transfer, you can copy an existing individual, and that's why there's controversy,"" says Griffin. In nuclear transfer, DNA from an unfertilized egg is removed and replaced with DNA from an adult body cell -- a skin cell, for example. When the process works, the manipulated cell -- coaxed by the newly-implanted genetic material -- begins to divide and eventually becomes a genetic replica of the adult-cell donor. The process produces a new individual whose identical twin is not a minute or two older, but already grown up. Now, researchers in South Korea and the University of Michigan have cloned a human embryo. This is not cloning to make a genetically matched baby, but cloning for research purposes -- also called therapeutic cloning or research cloning. This new development means that therapeutic cloning -- the ability to create human clones for research purposes -- is no longer a theory, but a reality. And it's sure to reignite the controversy of whether to ban all cloning or to allow some cloning for therapeutic purposes. Therapeutic cloning is not new. Scientists have used the technology to cure a variety of diseases in mice. Scientists have also studied the potential uses of human stem cells culled from embryos leftover in fertility clinics. Embryo Successfully Cloned Previous attempts to clone human embryos to obtain stem cells genetically identical to the patient are believed to have failed despite reports to the contrary -- until now. In this new study, researchers collected 242 eggs donated by 16 South Korean volunteers. Women also donated some cells from their ovary. The scientists then used a technique called somatic nuclear transfer to remove the genetic material -- which contains the nucleus of each egg -- and replace it with the nucleus from the donor's ovarian cell. Then, using chemicals to trigger cell division, the researchers were able to create 30 blastocysts -- early-stage embryos that contain about 100 cells -- that were a genetic copy of the donor cells. Next, the researchers harvested a single colony of stem cells that have the potential to grow into any tissue in the body. Because they are the genetic match to the donor, they aren't likely to be rejected by the patient's immune system. ""Our approach opens the door for the use of these specially developed cells in transplantation medicine,"" says Woo Suk Hwang, a scientist who led the research in South Korea. Feasibility Questioned But some researchers doubt that this technique for human cloning could ever be used for widespread treatment of disease. ""The great vision of this field is to create personalized stem cells for individual patients,"" says Griffin. ""You'd take the cell from the patient and create the cell type you want -- say pancreatic islet cells for diabetics -- by transferring it to an egg, creating an embryo, and growing them."" ""If there were enough women to donate enough eggs, and enough [funding], I'm certain it could be done,"" says Steven Stice, PhD, professor and GRE Eminent Scholar at the University of Georgia in Athens. ""But we collect hundreds of eggs a day from cattle to do our cloning. You could never expect to do that in humans. Technically, it's not feasible."" ""In the U.K., 120,000 people suffer from Parkinson's disease . Where are you going to get 120,000 human eggs? The reality is that there simply are not enough eggs ... available to make therapeutic cloning a practical, routine therapy,"" says Griffin. And offering women money would still not yield the necessary numbers. The egg-harvesting process is just too uncomfortable. ""Egg donation is akin to bone marrow transplantation as far as how unpleasant the process is for the donor,"" says Griffin. And then there's money. ""You'd have to produce an individual cell line for each person to avoid the immune response,"" says Stice. ""The cost would be horrendous. It will be very difficult to get to an application [of the technology] that won't cost hundreds of thousands of dollars [each time]."" In the end, both experts agree that therapeutic cloning is really unnecessary, given the existing supply of viable embryos left over from in vitro fertilization . ""They would be discarded,"" says Stice. ""They're donated with consent, and would never have gone on to form an individual. There are great opportunities with existing cell lines to get to the point of treating disease. We don't have to go to [cloning]."" So why continue? Because of the wealth of information it can provide, says Griffin. Cloning Doesn't Create a Twin But there's another angle to cloning. For some, the technology is seen not as a source for stem cells to cure disease, but as a last, best hope for biological offspring, or, mistakenly and tragically, as a means of ""bringing back"" a lost spouse, child, or other loved one. First of all, says Griffin, ""only about 1 to 2% of cloned animals make it to live birth."" And you can't even extrapolate that number to humans, because cows and sheep get pregnant much more easily than do women. What's more, many animal clones die late in pregnancy, or early in life, he says. Sure, there are healthy animal clones that appear to be normal. ""But the tests of normality in animals are not particularly rigorous. From a safety point of view alone, no one should be attempting to clone a child,"" says Griffin. Even if technology advances to the point where human reproductive cloning, as it's called, were a viable option -- and as you've seen, we're not even close -- anyone suggesting that cloning can duplicate an existing human being is just plain wrong, says Stice. Identical twins are most certainly two different people -- they even have different fingerprints despite sharing 100% of their DNA. In the same way, your clone would be a unique individual. In fact, says Stice, your clone would be ""even less [like you] than your twin. Most twins are raised in similar environments, whereas a clone of an adult will most likely have different experiences and different environmental factors affecting them [as they grow]."" No matter how far science takes us, one thing is certain, people are simply not replaceable."
51,Clostridium Difficile (C. Diff),"What Is Clostridium Difficile (C. diff)? Clostridium difficile (C. diff) is a type of bacteria that can cause colitis , a serious inflammation of the colon . Infections from C. diff often start after you've been taking antibiotics . It can sometimes be life-threatening. Clostridium Difficile (C. diff) Symptoms When you have C. diff , the symptoms can range from mild to severe. Mild symptoms can include problems like: Watery diarrhea that happens three to four times a day for several days Stomach pain , cramping, or tenderness In more serious infections, there may be blood or pus in the stool. This can happen because C. diff can cause the colon -- also called the large intestine -- to get inflamed. When this happens, tissue in the colon can bleed or make pus. Other symptoms of a serious infection include: Diarrhea more than 10 times a day Severe cramping Fever Nausea Loss of appetite/ weight loss Dehydration Rapid heart rate If your C. diff infection is severe, you could get severe intestinal inflammation . Your colon could also get enlarged and you could develop an extreme response to infection called sepsis . All of these problems are serious and could send you to the hospital. If your diarrhea from C. diff is very severe, get medical help quickly. Severe diarrhea can lead to life-threatening dehydration. Clostridium Difficile (C. diff) Causes and Risk Factors C. diff exists all around us. It's in the air, water , soil, and in the feces of humans and animals. C. diff bacteria that are outside the body turn into spores that can live on surfaces for weeks or months. These spores are not ""active,"" but they can turn active after you swallow them and they get into your intestines. Some people have the bacteria in their intestines and never have any symptoms. But for others, the bacteria make toxins that attack the intestines . A new strain of C. diff bacteria makes larger amounts of toxins. These types are hard to treat with medications . C. diff bacteria spread in health care facilities, like hospitals or nursing homes, where workers are more likely to come into contact with it and then with patients or residents. You can also become infected if you touch clothing, sheets, or other surfaces that have come in contact with feces and then touch your mouth or nose. Older adults in health care facilities are most at risk, especially if they're taking antibiotics. That's because the human body contains thousands of different types of bacteria -- some good, some bad. If the antibiotics kill enough healthy bacteria, the ones that cause C. diff could grow unchecked and make you sick. The antibiotics that are most linked to a risk of C. diff infection are: Fluoroquinolones Cephalosporins Penicillins Clindamycin An increasing number of younger people also develop C. diff infections, even without taking antibiotics or being in a hospital. Failure to wash your hands thoroughly after being exposed to the bacteria can lead to infection. You also have higher odds of getting C. diff if you have: A condition such as colorectal cancer or inflammatory bowel disease A weakened immune system caused by cancer treatment or another health problem Women have higher chances of getting C. diff than men. You're also more at risk for the disease if you're 65 or older. And your odds of C. diff go up the more times you've had the disease before. Clostridium Difficile (C. Diff) Complications If a C. diff infection isn't treated quickly, you could become dehydrated due to severe diarrhea. This loss of fluids might also affect your: Blood pressure Kidney function Overall health A C. diff infection also can lead to rare problems such as: Toxic megacolon . Your colon dilates and can't release gas or stool. This could cause it to swell and rupture. It can be life-threatening without emergency surgery. Bowel perforation. This is a hole in your large intestines that allows dangerous bacteria to escape. It can lead to a dangerous infection called peritonitis . Clostridium Difficile (C. Diff) Diagnosis If your doctor suspects you have this infection, they'll probably order one or more stool tests. They include: Enzyme immunoassay Polymerase chain reaction GDH/EIA Cell cytotoxicity assay If your doctor suspects serious problems with your colon, they might order X-rays or a CT scan of your intestines. In rare cases, your doctor may examine your colon with procedures such as a flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy. Clostridium Difficile (C. Diff) Treatment Antibiotics may have triggered your infection, but some types of these drugs target C. diff . They include: Fidaxomicin Metronidazole Vancomycin Talk with your doctor about the side effects of these antibiotics. It's important to replace fluids that you lost from diarrhea. Drink plenty of fluids that have water , salt, and sugar , such as broth and fruit juices. If there's been damage to your intestines, you may need surgery to remove the affected areas. Sometimes, a C. diff infection can come back. Doctors sometimes recommend a treatment to help repopulate the colon with healthy bacteria. It's often done by putting another person's stool in your colon using a device called a colonoscope. The procedure is called fecal microbiota transplant (FMT). Donors are screened carefully to make sure they're not passing along infections or parasites . Clostridium Difficile (C. Diff) Prevention If you're in a hospital or long-term health care facility, you can do several things to protect yourself from C. diff . For example: Ask your health care professionals to wash their hands thoroughly before and after caring for you. Request that all medical equipment be sanitized before being brought into your room. Wash your hands with soap and water after using the bathroom and before eating. Another way to help prevent C. diff is to not take unnecessary antibiotics. Talk this over with your doctor and see if there are other treatment options. And don't take antibiotics without a doctor's OK. Many C. diff infections are mild and short-lived, but others can be quite serious. Take precautions, and don't hesitate to seek medical help if you have symptoms."
52,Cluster Headaches,"Cluster headaches are a series of relatively short but very painful headaches every day for weeks or months at a time. You tend to get them at the same time each year, such as in the spring or fall. Because of this, people often mistake cluster headaches for symptoms of allergies or work stress . Experts don't know what causes them, but a nerve in your face is involved, creating intense pain around one of your eyes . It's so bad that most people can't sit still and will often pace during an attack. Cluster headaches can be more severe than a migraine , but they usually don't last as long. These are the least common type of headaches, affecting fewer than one in 1,000 people. Men get them more than women do. You usually start getting them before age 30. Cluster headaches may go away completely (this is called going into remission) for months or years, but they can come back without any warning. What Happens You get a cluster headache when a nerve pathway in the base of your brain is triggered. That signal seems to come from a deeper part of the brain called the hypothalamus , home of the ""internal biological clock"" that controls your sleep and wake cycles. The nerve that's affected, the trigeminal nerve, is responsible for sensations such as heat or pain in your face. It's near your eye , and it branches up to your forehead, across your cheek, down your jaw, and above your ear on the same side. A brain condition, such as a tumor or aneurysm , won't cause these headaches. Characteristics of Cluster Headaches There are a few things that set this type of headache apart. They include: Speed. Cluster headaches generally reach their full force quickly, within 5 or 10 minutes. Pain. It’s almost always on one side of your head, and it stays on the same side during a period, the time when you're getting daily attacks. (When a new headache period starts, it might switch to the opposite side, but that's rare.) It's often described as a burning or piercing. It may be throbbing or constant. You'll feel it behind or around one eye . It may spread to your forehead, temple, nose, cheek, or upper gum on that side. Your scalp may be tender. You can often feel your blood pulsing. Short duration. Cluster headaches usually last only 30 to 90 minutes. They can be as short as 15 minutes or as long as 3 hours, but then they disappear. You'll probably get one to three of these headaches a day. Some people have as few as one every other day, while others get them up to eight times a day. Predictable. Attacks seem to be linked to the circadian rhythm, your body's 24-hour clock. They happen so regularly, generally at the same time each day, that they've been called ""alarm clock headaches."" They might even wake you up an hour or two after you go to bed. Nighttime attacks can be more severe than daytime ones. Frequent. Most people will get daily headaches for 2 weeks to 3 months; in between these periods, they'll be pain-free for at least 2 weeks. Symptoms The pain usually starts suddenly, often around or behind the eye. You may notice: Discomfort or a mild burning feeling A swollen or drooping eye A smaller pupil in the eye Eye redness or watering Runny or congested nose Red, warm face Sweating Sensitivity to light Restlessness or agitation, pacing Cluster headaches are more common in people who smoke or who are heavy drinkers. During a cluster period, you'll be more sensitive to alcohol and nicotine. Just a bit of alcohol can trigger a headache. But drinking won't trigger one during headache-free periods. Triggers When you’re in a cluster period, any of these can bring on a headache: Cigarette smoke Alcohol Strong smells Change to a high altitude Bright light Exercise or exertion Heat Foods that contain nitrates, such as bacon or lunch meat Cocaine Migraine vs. Cluster Headache Both types of headaches cause intense pain. But the way they hurt and where you feel them are different. Migraine headaches begin slowly and can last a few hours to a few days. You might get some warning signs up to a day before the pain starts, like cravings for certain foods or changes in your mood. You might also see auras just before the migraine hits. Migraine gives you a throbbing pain. A cluster headache usually hurts on just one side of your head, but you might feel a migraine on both sides, on one side only, or along your forehead. It will probably get worse when you move your head. You may also have: Nausea and vomiting Sensitivity to light, sound, and smells Colored spots, lines, flashing lights, or sparkles in your vision , called auras Numbness or tingling Weakness Trouble speaking or hearing After a migraine ends, you can have a sort of ""hangover,"" where you feel tired or confused. You may hear your doctor call this a postdrome period. Many things can trigger a migraine, such as: Changes in the weather Too much or too little sleep Strong smells Stress Loud noises Too little food Anxiety or depression Certain medicines Hormone changes Caffeine , certain foods, and food additives Treatment You have several options when it comes to treating cluster headaches: Medications Acute attack treatments help when the headache hits: Triptans. These drugs are among the best ways to treat the pain. You might get: Sumatriptan ( Imitrex , Onzetra Xsail, Sumavel, Zecuity, Zembrace SymTouch), which works both as a shot or inhaled Zolmitriptan ( Zomig ) Dihydroergotamine (DHE 45). This prescription medicine is based on the ergot fungus. Octreotide. This is a lab-made form of somatostatin, a growth hormone. You take it through an IV in your vein. Lidocaine . This is a pain reliever, in the form of a nasal spray. Oxygen. Your doctor might call it inhaled oxygen. You’ll breathe it in through a face mask for 15 minutes. Preventive medicine can often stop a headache before it starts. Your doctor can prescribe medication to make a cluster shorter and make attacks less severe, including: Corticosteroids like prednisone Divalproex sodium (Depakote) Galcanezumab ( Emgality) Ergotamine tartrate ( Cafergot , Ergomar ) Gabapentin (Gralise, Neurontin ) Lithium carbonate Topiramate ( Qudexy XR, Topamax, Trokendi XR ) Verapamil ( Calan , Verelan ) Occipital nerve block (your doctor may also call it occipital nerve injection). The doctor will inject a mix of anesthetic and steroid into these nerves. They’re at the base of your skull, and they’re often the starting point for headaches. This is a temporary treatment until a preventive can start to work. Nerve stimulation. If medication doesn’t work, some people have success with: Occipital nerve stimulation. Your doctor surgically implants a device that sends electrical impulses to this group of nerves at the base of your skull. Neuromodulation . These FDA-approved noninvasive devices include: Cefaly. You put electrodes on your forehead and connect them to a headband-like controller that sends signals to your supraorbital nerve. GammaCore. This gadget, also known as a noninvasive vagus nerve stimulator (nVNS), uses electrodes to send signals to this nerve. Surgery If nothing else works, surgery may be an option for people who don't get a break from cluster headaches. Deep brain stimulation , which involves placing an electrode deep into the brain, is losing favor to less invasive options. Most procedures involve blocking the trigeminal nerve, a main pathway for pain. It controls the area around your eye, but a misstep can lead to weakness in your jaw and loss of sensation in your face and head. Lifestyle changes These moves can help you avoid cluster headaches: Keep a regular sleep schedule. A change to your routine can kick off a headache. Skip alcohol. Any type, even beer and wine, can trigger a bout of headaches when you’re in a cluster series. Alternative treatments Talk to your doctor about: Capsaicin . A nasal spray of this pain reliever might help. Melatonin . This medication, known for easing sleep problems like jet lag , might lower the number of headaches. Breathing exercises Breathing exercises have real effects on your body that help keep you calm and control your stress. And for people who get tension headaches or migraine, they can be a key part of treatment. But are they any match for the intense pain of a cluster headache? While there haven't been studies to show it, some doctors think they're worth trying. After all, there's no harm, and it won't cost you anything. Breathing exercises can lower anxiety. So if you worry about your next attack, they're a good tool to help you stay even and relaxed. You can try different types of breathing. No matter which one you use, it helps to: Find a quiet space where you won't be bothered. Sit down and get comfy. Let go of your worries for a few minutes. It's also best to set aside time for it each day. This regular practice will train your body to fall into the breathing more easily when you need it. If you do it only when you're in pain, it'll be much harder to really sink into it. And keep in mind that these exercises can’t replace medicine. They're something to use along with your normal treatment. Deep breathing. When you're stressed and anxious, you tend to take shorter breaths than usual. This exercise helps you reset. The aim is slow, deep, and steady breaths: Put your focus on your bellybutton. You might want to put a hand there to help. As you breathe in through your nose, pull the air into your belly. Feel it expand as you fill up your lungs . Breathe out through your nose with a long, slow breath. Pull your belly in as you empty out your lungs. You can even think to yourself, ""Relax."" With each full, deep breath, your nervous system takes it down a notch. Rhythmic breathing. If your breathing style is usually short and fast, this exercise will help you slow it down a bit: Breathe in slowly through your nose as you count to five. Breathe out slowly through your nose as you count to five. Repeat and see if you can feel yourself relax with each breath. As you notice yourself getting calmer, you give your body feedback that helps you relax even further. Visualized breathing. For this one, you combine breathing with pictures in your mind: Get comfortable, close your eyes, and breathe normally. As you breathe in through your nose, picture calming air that fills up your lungs and expands your chest and belly. Imagine you're breathing in more and more relaxation. As you breathe out, picture pushing the tension out right along with your breath. Repeat, breathing in calm and out tension."
53,What Is CMTC?,"Sometimes, a condition has a name that’s much scarier than the problems it causes. That’s usually the case with cutis marmorata telangiectatica congenita , or CMTC. CMTC is a rare disease. It causes a blue or purple pattern on the skin that looks marbled or like fishnet. It generally shows up at birth or shortly after. Most often, it doesn’t need treatment and is just an issue of looks. It gets better as your child gets older. Cutis marmorata telangiectatica congenita, or CMTC is a rare disease that affects some newborn, causing a blue or purple pattern on the skin that looks marbled or like fishnet. It generally appears on the legs but can show up elsewhere on the body but clears ups as your child gets older. CMTC usually doesn’t need treatment and gets better as your child gets older. In rare cases it may affect growth  where it appears The pattern is formed by blood vessels near the skin that are wider than normal, but doctors don’t know what causes it. Once in a while, another family member also has CMTC, but that’s not typical. More often, it happens at random, and it doesn’t seem that anything during pregnancy triggers it. What Are the Symptoms? The main sign is the blue or purple marbled pattern on the skin. It looks a lot like what happens to a baby’s skin when they’re cold, but it’s more defined and doesn’t go away. Most children get it on the legs, but it can happen on the arms, torso, or very rarely, the face and scalp. The pattern may get larger when your child moves, cries, or gets cold. It doesn’t happen often, but CMTC can also cause: Bleeding on areas of the skin where the pattern appears, sometimes along with pain Slower or larger growth of the limb that has the pattern Does It Cause Any Other Problems? This is a much harder question to answer. CMTC is rare and doctors are always learning more about it. It’s not common, but because CMTC may affect growth of the limb where it appears, your child could have one leg or arm that’s longer than the other. Some children with CMTC in their legs also get superficial venous insufficiency -- that’s where the veins in the legs have trouble pushing blood back up to the heart . Beyond those two problems, it’s less clear. In the past, it looked like children with CMTC were also sometimes born with issues ranging from pressure buildup in the eye ( glaucoma ) to muscle loss. But more recent studies seem to show that these children don’t have CMTC. Instead, they have other conditions such as Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome and Cowden's disease. How Will My Doctor Test For It? Your doctor will talk to you about your child’s health history and do a physical exam . That’s typically enough to know if it’s CMTC. If your doctor thinks there’s a different problem, your child may get some imaging, such as an X-ray, CT, or MRI. If CMTC shows on the face or scalp, your child may get an eye exam and a neurological exam, which checks to make sure their brain , nerves, and spinal cord work as normal. How Is It Treated? Often, children with CMTC don’t need treatment and the skin pattern goes away on its own. Usually, the pattern fades the most by the time your child is one, and it will continue to fade as your child’s skin thickens. In many cases, it’s gone within the first few years of life. And once it fades, it doesn’t come back. Even without treatment, you’ll likely have regular visits with your doctor to keep an eye out for any issues. This is especially important since doctors are always learning about CMTC and similar diseases. Your child may need treatment in the following cases: CMTC is on the face or scalp Leg, knee , or hip pain , or other signs that the legs are growing at different rates Pattern bleeds, grows, or causes pain Signs of superficial venous insufficiency Your doctor will recommend a plan to treat these or any other symptoms. For example, if your child has bleeding, you’ll get special bandages for it. If that happens a lot, they may get treated with a device called a pulse dye laser . It destroys the blood vessels that cause problems even after CMTC has faded. It’s very effective, doesn’t harm the skin, and usually doesn’t cause scars. Also, CMTC may create some anxiety for you and your child. The pattern may not fade completely, and that can be hard on an older child if it’s easily seen, especially on the face or neck. Your doctor can help you find a counselor to support your family."
54,Cytomegalovirus (CMV),"What Is Cytomegalovirus? Cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) is a common virus. Over half of adults in the U.S. have it in their body by age 40. CMV spreads easily through an infected person’s saliva or other body fluids. It’s related to the herpes virus, which gives you cold sores . If you have a healthy immune system that can easily control the virus, it usually doesn't cause problems. But it can make people who have weakened immune systems sick. In people who have advanced HIV , CMV can cause an eye infection called retinitis that may lead to blindness. CMV retinitis is what’s known as an AIDS-defining condition. The virus could also affect your intestines , esophagus , lungs , brain , or nerves. There are different types of cytomegalovirus infection. Congenital. This is when a baby gets CMV from its mother before birth. Primary. This is the first time someone gets CMV. It usually doesn’t cause symptoms, but some people may have signs that look like mononucleosis . Reactivation. An infection that has been dormant can become active again when your immune system is weakened. It can happen if you have advanced HIV, are in treatment for cancer , or have an organ transplant . Cytomegalovirus Symptoms General symptoms of primary CMV Most healthy people who get CMV don't know it. If you have symptoms of primary CMV, they're mild and include: Fatigue Swollen glands Fever Sore throat Muscle aches Less common symptoms of primary CMV In rare cases, CMV can also cause: Changes to your personality Headaches Trouble concentrating Shortness of breath Dry cough Symptoms of congenital CMV Babies born with CMV might have: Premature delivery Small size or low birth weight Bruise-like rashes Yellow skin or eyes ( jaundice ) Swollen liver and spleen Small head ( microcephaly ) Seizures Hearing loss Pneumonia Liver inflammation (hepatitis) Symptoms of CMV with HIV If you also have advanced HIV, CMV can affect different parts of your body. You could have: Blind spots or moving black spots ( floaters ) in your eyesight Blurry vision Blindness Diarrhea Belly pain Trouble swallowing or painful swallowing because of ulcers in your mouth or esophagus Confusion Lower back pain Weight loss Fatigue Weakness in your legs If you have HIV, you probably won’t get sick with CMV unless your CD4 count, a type of white blood cell, is below 100. Cytomegalovirus Causes and Transmission You probably won't catch CMV from casual contact. But you can get it by touching your eyes , nose, or mouth after having contact with an infected person's: Saliva Semen Vaginal fluids Blood Urine Breast milk You can also get cytomegalovirus through: Sexual contact Blood transfusions Organ transplants CMV spreads easily in places with lots of young children, like day-care centers, so anyone who spends time there is at higher risk of getting it. You’re also more likely to get the virus if your immune system is weakened because of a medication or another health condition. Cytomegalovirus Tests and Diagnosis Your doctor will order tests such as: Blood and urine tests. These include CMV antigen (a part of the virus), a virus culture, or PCR (a molecular test). Serologic tests look for things your immune system makes to fight CMV, called IgM and IgG antibodies, although most healthy people also have them. A biopsy. Your doctor takes a small sample of tissue from your intestines , your esophagus, or your lung and look at it under a microscope. Eye tests to check for inflammation in your retina. Imaging tests , like a CT scan , to look for changes in your lungs or brain. Cytomegalovirus Treatment When you have retinitis because of CMV, your doctor may give you strong medications intravenously (through a vein) for a couple of weeks, a process called induction therapy. After a while, they may switch you to pills. You might have medication injected into your eye if your vision is in danger. Your doctor might prescribe drugs including: Cidofovir ( Vistide ) Foscarnet ( Foscavir ) Ganciclovir ( Cytovene ) Maribavir (Livtencity) Valganciclovir ( Valcyte ) These drugs generally can't cure the disease if you have advanced HIV, but they can control it while you get antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) for your HIV infection. Depending on the medicine, you could have side effects including: Low white blood cell count ( neutropenia ), which raises your chance for other infections Feeling tired from low red blood cell count ( anemia ) Upset stomach or throwing up Rash Kidney problems Most important, if you take ART early in an HIV infection, the drugs will keep it from getting worse and will keep you from getting CMV in the first place. Cytomegalovirus Complications It’s rare, but CMV can cause complications including: Mononucleosis Guillain -Barre syndrome Brain inflammation ( encephalitis ) Heart inflammation ( myocarditis ) In people with HIV, complications include: Retinitis Pneumonia Skin rashes and lesions Problems in the nerves, esophagus, lungs, colon , or mucous membranes Brain swelling Complications in babies born with CMV include: Learning problems Cerebral palsy or trouble with muscle tone and coordination Seizures Cytomegalovirus Outlook There’s no cure for CMV. The virus stays inactive in your body and can cause more problems later. This reactivation is most common in people who’ve had stem cell and organ transplants. Your outlook depends on your overall health. In people who have strong immune systems, CMV symptoms almost always go away on their own. Congenital CMV can have lifelong effects. The risks are highest when the mother has their first CMV infection during a pregnancy. If you have a weakened immune system, you might need treatment for the rest of your life to prevent complications. Cytomegalovirus Prevention CMV was once the most common viral opportunistic infection -- illnesses that are worse or happen more often in people with weakened immune systems -- tied to HIV. Now, ART can help keep your CD4 count up and your immune system strong. It can also help stop retinitis from coming back. If you have advanced HIV, your doctor might also give you medicine to prevent CMV, in addition to your ART. But it's expensive, sometimes causes severe side effects, and may not work well. The most important thing is to take your ART medications daily as prescribed. Talk to your doctor about your chance of getting CMV if you're having a blood transfusion ."
55,Understanding Cochlear Implants,"If you're very hard of hearing or deaf, a cochlear implant may help you get back the sounds you miss. It isn't a hearing aid, which makes sounds louder. It’s a small device that a doctor puts in your ear through surgery. It sends impulses directly to your auditory (hearing) nerve, which carries sound signals to your brain. The implant doesn't make you hear normally again, but it can help you with sounds. Most people with severe to profound hearing loss can understand speech in person or over the phone better than they did with a hearing aid. It can usually help you know sounds around you, including telephones, doorbells, and alarms. Many people also can pick up on speech in noisy places better than they did with hearing aids, or even enjoy music again. How does a cochlear implant work? It's for children and adults with sensorineural hearing loss. That condition typically involves damage to tiny hair cells in a part of your inner ear called the cochlea. These hair cells usually pick up the vibrations of sounds and send them to the brain through the auditory nerve. When they’re damaged, sound can't reach that nerve. A cochlear implant skips the damaged hair cells and sends signals to the auditory nerve directly. These devices have two parts. One part, the receiver-stimulator, is placed under your skin through surgery. The other, the speech processor, you wear behind your ear like a hearing aid. The outside part is slightly larger than a normal behind-the-ear hearing aid. First, a surgeon puts a receiver under your skin behind your ear through a small cut. The receiver is connected to electrodes, which they’ll put into a part of your inner ear called the cochlea. The surgery takes an hour or two, and you’ll probably go home the same day. One to two weeks after the procedure, your doctor will fit your speech processor. You wear the processor, which looks like a hearing aid, behind your ear. The processor may be connected to the microphone and worn at your ear, or you might wear it somewhere else on your body, depending on how active you are, your age, or your lifestyle. These processors offer different programs and telephone options. They also can connect to assistive listening devices and other technology you use, like an iPod. Some have rechargeable batteries, which can lower costs over time. When there are sounds around you, the microphone and processor pick them up and change them into electrical impulses. Then the transmitter sends these coded signals to the receiver under your skin. Next, the receiver delivers the signals to the electrodes inside your cochlea. These electrodes stimulate the auditory nerve, which carries the signals to the brain, where you recognize them as sound. What are the advantages of a cochlear implant? It can be life-changing if you have a serious hearing problem. But the results aren't the same for everyone. Some people benefit more than others. Some of the pros: You may be able to hear speech at a nearly normal level. You may be able to understand speech without lip reading. It’s easier to talk on the phone and hear the TV. You may be able to hear music better than before. You can pick up on different types of sounds, including soft, medium, and loud ones. You can better control your own voice so that it’s easier for others to understand you. What are the disadvantages and risks? Cochlear implant surgery is very safe, but any operation comes with risks. Problems can include bleeding, infections, and side effects from the medicine that sends you to sleep during the procedure. Other possible complications include: A nerve injury that changes your sense of taste Nerve damage that causes weakness or paralysis in your face Dizziness or balance problems Loss of the hearing in the treated ear Ringing in your ears, called tinnitus Leaking of the fluid around the brain The device doesn’t work or gets infected, which may mean you’ll have to remove and replace the implant. Meningitis , an infection of the membranes around the brain. It’s a rare but serious complication. Children and people with abnormally formed inner ears seem to be at higher risk. The FDA and CDC recommend vaccines for anyone who gets a cochlear implant to lower their risk for the disease. Keep some other things in mind, too: If you have some hearing left, sound may seem ""mechanical"" or ""synthetic,"" although most people no longer notice this after several months. If you need an MRI, you may first need a simple procedure to briefly take out the magnet in the cochlear implant. But more medical facilities can do these imaging tests without removing the magnet. There’s also a type of cochlear implant that has a magnet you don't need to take out in order to have an MRI. Most of the newer cochlear implant devices are compatible with a 1.5 Tesla MRI without any special precautions or considerations. Some parts of the device can get damaged if they get wet. You need to take off the speech processor before you bathe, shower, or swim. You also can cover that part with a waterproof case or choose a waterproof cochlear implant processor. Rarely, the implant may stop working, and you’d need surgery to fix the problem. Who should get a cochlear implant? The American Speech-Language-Hearing Association says the device is best for adults who have: Severe to profound hearing loss in both ears Hearing loss after they’ve already learned speech and language Limited help from hearing aids (learn more about what to expect when transitioning from a hearing aid to cochlear implants) No medical problems that would make surgery risky A strong desire to hear better A good understanding of what the device will -- and won’t -- do for them Also, cochlear implants work better for people who have lost their hearing recently, as well as those who’ve already used a hearing aid successfully. Can children get them? The FDA says children can get the devices starting at age 1. Most kids who are diagnosed with significant hearing loss as babies get them as soon as possible. A cochlear implant in early childhood exposes children to sound during the critical period when they learn speech and language skills. The devices work best for children who: Have profound hearing loss in one or both ears Get limited help from hearing aids Are healthy, with no medical problems that would make surgery risky Are ready to learn how to communicate with a cochlear implant Have support from their parents, teachers, and school programs to help them gain hearing skills Are younger than age 5, unless they have progressive hearing loss Join in intensive speech therapy and programs to teach speaking skills A study found that children who got a cochlear implant before 18 months old had major improvements in their hearing, speaking, and learning. But the devices also can help older children who lose their hearing after they’ve learned to talk. How do I know if the implant is a good choice for me? If you have severe or profound hearing loss, a team of experts at a cochlear implant center can help you decide if the device and surgery will work for you. Typically, these experts include an ear doctor called an otologist, an audiologist, a psychologist, a counselor, and a speech-language pathologist. The team works together to determine if you are a candidate for a cochlear implant, do the surgery, and offer follow-up care. You may have tests, such as: An exam of your external, middle, and inner ear to check for infections or other issues Hearing tests such as an audiogram, a graph that charts how you respond to specific sounds A hearing aid evaluation CT or MRI scans to check the inner ear and hearing nerve. These tests will tell your doctor if your cochlea has a normal shape. A physical exam A psychological exam to see if you can handle the changes that come with the implant. This test is more common for children. When you're thinking about getting a cochlear implant, counseling will help you know what you can expect from the device and make sure you understand what it takes to learn how to use the implant. After your surgery, a rehab program may help, too. The goal is to learn how to listen through the implant. Doctors always recommend that children who get implants go through this.

56,Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10),"What Is CoQ10? Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is a nutrient that occurs naturally in your body. CoQ10 is also in many foods you eat. CoQ10 acts as an antioxidant, which protects cells from damage and plays an important part in your metabolism. What Are Some CoQ10 Benefits? Although CoQ10 plays a key role in the body, most healthy people have enough CoQ10 naturally. CoQ10 has been used to treat many different conditions. There's evidence that CoQ10 supplements can lower blood pressure slightly. Though still controversial, some preliminary evidence suggests that CoQ10 may help prevent or treat the adverse effects, such as muscle pains and liver problems, of taking statin-type cholesterol drugs. Preliminary studies show that CoQ10 may slow, but not stop, the progression of Alzheimer's disease. Additional research is needed to confirm this effect. CoQ10 has also been studied as a preventive treatment for migraine headaches, though it may take several months to work. It has also been studied for low sperm count, cancer, HIV, muscular dystrophy , Parkinson’s disease, gum disease, and many other conditions. However, research has not found any conclusive benefits. Although CoQ10 is sometimes sold as an energy supplement, there's no evidence that it boosts energy in a typical person. Benefits also may include: Heart health . Risk factors for heart failure, such as high blood pressure and coronary heart disease, often lead to oxidative stress and cell damage. Studies show that CoQ10 can improve symptoms and reduce the risk of heart-related complications. It may also reduce the risk of heart disease and high blood pressure. Brain health. CoQ10 may reduce harmful compounds that could increase your risk of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. In turn, this could slow disease progression. CoQ10 and Fertility Eggs and sperm are susceptible to oxidative damage. CoQ10 may help stop, and even reverse, the decline in egg quantity and quality as you age. Studies also show that the compound could improve sperm activity and concentration, boosting fertility. CoQ10 Dosage and Supplements There's no established ideal dose of CoQ10. Studies have used doses of CoQ10 ranging from 50 to 1,200 milligrams in adults, sometimes split into several doses over the course of a day. CoQ10 supplements. The amount of CoQ10 found naturally in foods is much lower than that found in supplements . In many cases, a doctor might recommend a CoQ10 supplement. There are no known ideal dosages, as everyone’s needs vary. Standard dosages for CoQ10 supplements range between 60 and 500 milligrams daily, and the highest recommended daily dose is around 1,200 milligrams. Follow the instructions on the bottle or get advice from your doctor or a dietitian. Keep in mind that different supplement brands might have different ingredients and strengths. When to take CoQ10. As CoQ10 is fat-soluble, it's best taken with a meal that contains fat, so that your body can better absorb it. Some studies show it may work better if taken at night. CoQ10 Foods While many people’s bodies make all the CoQ10 they need, some don’t. The whole body content is between 500 and 1,500 milligrams, and it decreases with age. Salmon is a good source of CoQ10. Good food sources of CoQ10 include: Organ meats. CoQ10 is present in cells throughout your body, mostly concentrated in your vital organs. This means animal organ meats have the highest amounts of CoQ10 per 100 grams. For instance, a beef heart has 11.3 milligrams, and a beef liver has 3.9 milligrams. A chicken heart has 9.2 milligrams and liver has 11.6 milligrams. Fatty fish. Fatty fish such as trout, salmon, mackerel, and sardines contain CoQ10. Mackerel provides about 6.75 milligrams per 100 grams while trout provides 0.85 milligrams per 100 grams. Meat . It’s not just animal organs that provide CoQ10. Because it lives throughout your body, it's present in all meat forms. Beef offers about 3.1 milligrams per 100 grams, chicken has 1.4 milligrams, and pork has 2.4 milligrams. Reindeer meat provides about 15.8 milligrams. Soybeans . Soybean products such as tofu , soy milk, and soy yogurt are a valuable protein source. Soybeans also have many other vitamins and minerals, as well as CoQ10. Boiled soybeans have 1.2 milligrams per 100 grams. Other soy products contain lesser amount of CoQ10, with tofu at 0.3 milligrams and soy milk at 0.25 milligrams. Vegetables. Along with many vitamins and minerals, a lot of vegetables contain CoQ10. Among them, broccoli has high CoQ10 content, weighing in at 0.6 to 0.86 milligrams per 100 grams. Nuts and seeds . Along with protein, heart-healthy fats, and other important nutrients, nuts and seeds provide CoQ10. Pistachios have 2 milligrams of CoQ10 per 100-gram serving, peanuts have 2.6 milligrams, and sesame seeds have 1.7 milligrams. CoQ10 Side Effects Most side effects of CoQ10 are mild. They include digestive problems, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, diarrhea , nausea , and heartburn. More serious risks are possible. Don't take CoQ10 supplements without first talking to your doctor if you: have heart failure have liver problems have diabetes are pregnant are breastfeeding take blood thinners take thyroid medications receive chemotherapy CoQ10 supplements are also not recommended for children. Does CoQ10 cause blood clots? Possibly. There's some evidence that CoQ10 can reduce the effectiveness of blood thinners like warfarin (Jantoven). This may increase your risk for blood clots."
57,What Is Cold Agglutinin Disease?,"Cold agglutinin disease (CAD) is a condition that makes your body’s immune system attack your red blood cells and destroy them. It’s triggered by cold temperatures, and it can cause problems that range from dizziness to heart failure. It’s also called cold antibody hemolytic anemia. About 1 person in 300,000 gets cold agglutinin disease. It shows up most often in people over 60, and women are more likely to get it than men. How It Happens When you breathe in, your red blood cells carry oxygen from your lungs to the rest of your body. Then they carry carbon dioxide back to the lungs for you to breathe out. A typical red blood cell lives about 120 days. Your body’s immune system makes proteins called antibodies that help you fight off infections. Some of these antibodies are called cold agglutinins because they’re triggered when your body’s temperature is below normal. With CAD, those antibodies attach themselves to red blood cells instead of to bacteria or viruses and eventually kill the red blood cells. When they do that faster than your body can replace red blood cells, it leads to a condition called anemia, which is when your body doesn’t have enough red blood cells. Symptoms CAD can make you feel weak and tired. Other signs of it include: Dizziness and headaches Sore back, legs, or joints Ringing in your ears Irritability or changes in your behavior Pale or yellow skin Vomiting or diarrhea Cold feet or hands Chest pains or an irregular heartbeat In women, cold agglutinin disease sometimes keeps them from having periods. Some people who have cold agglutinin disease also may get a cold, numb feeling, and loss of color in their fingers or toes, known as Raynaud’s phenomenon. Symptoms are typically worse in the winter when temperatures are lower. Causes Most of the time, cold agglutinin disease happens by itself, without any other related health problem. Doctors call that the primary, or idiopathic, form of the condition, and they don’t know why it happens. In other cases, another illness can bring on cold agglutinin disease. One of the most common conditions that triggers it is lymphoma, especially in people over 60. That's a type of cancer that affects your lymph nodes. But it also can happen if you have: A bacterial infection like E. coli , syphilis, or Legionnaire’s disease A virus, like the ones that cause the flu, hepatitis C, or AIDS A parasitic infection like malaria Other conditions that cause your immune system to turn on your body Other kinds of cancer that affect your blood cells, like multiple myeloma or leukemia Diagnosis If your doctor thinks you have cold agglutinin disease, blood tests can tell. A nurse or lab technician will take a sample of your blood so it can be looked at under a microscope. A complete blood count checks for signs of anemia, like lower numbers of red blood cells and a larger-than-normal number of new red blood cells. Your doctor will also want to see if the red blood cells are clumping together, which is another sign of the illness. If a complete blood count shows signs of CAD, another kind of blood test will look for a higher-than-normal number of cold agglutinins, the antibodies that kill red blood cells. This is called a direct antiglobulin test or a Coombs test. Your doctor may also feel your midsection to see if your liver or spleen is larger than it should be. Treatment This depends on how serious your symptoms are and whether CAD happened on its own or because of another illness. If you have another condition that’s led to CAD, your doctor will try to treat that first and see if it helps your symptoms. For example, if it was brought on by bacteria or a virus, your symptoms may go away a few months after you get over the infection. If your symptoms are mild, you may not need treatment. You may be able to avoid problems by keeping warm and staying out of cold weather. If your red blood cell count is very low, your doctor may need to filter your blood to get rid of the antibodies that are causing your condition (a procedure called plasmapheresis) or give you a blood transfusion. These are short-term treatments that can give you temporary relief, but they don’t do anything about the cause of the problem. If your anemia is severe, you may need to take medication. The only drug approved to specifically treat CAD is sutimlimab-jome ( Enjaymo ). It works by inhibiting the destruction of red blood cells and so decreases the need for blood transfusions. Another drug commonly used for CAD is rituximab, a drug that targets certain immune cells. (It was originally made to treat lymphoma.) You’ll probably get a dose once a week for several weeks. If these treatments don’t work, your doctor might suggest a drug called bortezomib that was made to treat a kind of cancer called multiple myeloma. Taking Care of Yourself Living with CAD starts with keeping warm. That means bundling up in winter and sometimes even in summer, since air-conditioning can sometimes trigger a reaction. You may want to bring extra clothing or find comfortable undergarments you can wear on a regular basis. You might need to stay away from cold foods and drinks as well. Cold agglutinin disease is a rare condition, but if you have it, you’re not alone. Support organizations and online communities can help you learn more and connect with others who are going through the same things."
58,When Should I Use Heat or Ice for Pain?,"Heat boosts the flow of blood and nutrients to an area of the body. It often works best for morning stiffness or to warm up muscles before activity. Cold slows blood flow, reducing swelling and pain . It’s often best for short-term pain, like that from a sprain or a strain. But does it matter which one you use for an injury? This article will help you sort it out. When Either Heat Or Cold Will Do Soothe aches and pains caused by conditions like osteoarthritis , rheumatoid arthritis , back pain , fibromyalgia , and neck pain with either heat or cold. Each can give you relief from these symptoms: Muscle aches, spasms, and pains Lower and upper back pain Stiff, swollen, or tender joints Neck stiffness Finger, hand , or wrist pain Knee pain For short-term pain relief of any of these conditions, apply a hot or cold compress using any of these items: An electric heating pad A gel pack that can be microwaved or frozen A bag of ice or frozen vegetables A washcloth or small towel soaked in hot or cold water (wring it out, fold it, and apply to the sore area) Whether you use heat or cold, be sure to wrap the pack in a thin towel to help protect your skin . Apply to the painful area for 15-20 minutes several times each day. Whether you use heat or cold, you may notice your skin looks a little pinker after applying the compress. That’s normal, but let your skin return to its normal color and temperature before applying fresh ice or heat. Call your doctor if you notice any of the following signs after removing the compress. These symptoms mean the temperature was too extreme and may have caused skin damage: Skin that’s purplish-red, dark red, or a spotty red and white color Hives Swelling Blisters Hydrotherapy Showers and baths aren't just for mornings. When you're hurting, stand under or settle into warm water for a few minutes to help soothe and relax you. (If you're over 70 or have heart problems, check with your doctor before getting into a hot tub.) Try a warm shower or bath before you exercise to help loosen joints and muscles. Use cool water after exercise to help calm deep, burning pain and reduce inflammation . Or you can mix it up with a contrast bath to increase blood flow, reduce pain and swelling, and promote healing. Get two tubs or containers large enough for your painful area ready with warm and cold water. Soak in the warm tub for about 5 minutes and then plunge into the cold tub for about 1 minute. Go back to the warm for a few more minutes and then the cold for a minute. Repeat four or five times. Warm Clothes Want an easier -- and less painful -- start to your day? Warm your clothes in the dryer for a few minutes before you put them on. The heated garments may help ease morning pain and stiffness. Heat Wraps If heat helps ease your pain, try a continuous low-level heat wrap, available at drugstores. You can wear a heat wrap for up to 8 hours, even while you sleep. Follow the directions carefully. Studies suggest that low-level, long-term heat applied directly on the skin can significantly reduce stiffness and tension and increase flexibility. The effects can last for 48 hours or longer. Heated Wax Therapy Another way to apply heat -- especially to hands, elbows, and feet -- is warm, melted paraffin. You can buy paraffin wax kits at your local drugstore or beauty supply. A heated container safely melts the wax and mineral oil to make a paraffin bath. Dip your achy body part into the bath several times to build up a warm layer. Take it out of the bath, and cover it with plastic and wrap in a towel for 10-15 minutes until the wax cools. Unwrap and peel the wax away. To avoid irritation and pain, make sure the skin that you treat has no cuts or sores."
59,Cold Sores,"What Is a Cold Sore? A cold sore is a group of tiny, painful blisters caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). They’re also called fever blisters or herpes simplex labialis. Up to 90% of people around the world have at least one form of HSV. The symptoms are usually the most serious the first you time you get cold sores. A first-time cold sore can make a child seriously ill. After the first outbreak, your body should make antibodies, and you may never have another infection. But many people get cold sores that come back. Cold sores, or fever blisters, are groups of small blisters on the lip and around the mouth. The skin around the blisters is often red, swollen, and sore. Photo credit: Courtesy of the CDC Cold Sore Symptoms Cold sores are most likely to show up on the outside of your mouth and lips, but you can also get them on your nose and cheeks. You may get cold sores as late as 20 days after you’re infected. The sore might appear near where the virus entered your body. Cold sores happen in stages: You have a tingling, burning, or itching feeling. About 12-24 hours later, blisters form. The area becomes red, swollen, and painful. The blisters break open and fluid comes out. This usually lasts 2 or 3 days. A scab forms on the sore. It might crack or bleed. The scab falls off. You might also have red or swollen gums, swollen glands in your neck, fever, or muscle aches. First-time infections can also cause: Burning and pain inside your mouth Sore throat Pain when you swallow Headache Upset stomach Cold Sore Causes You catch HSV when you come into contact with people or things that carry the virus. For instance, you can get it from kissing someone who has the virus or from sharing eating utensils, towels, or razors. Two types of the virus can cause cold sores: HSV-1 and HSV-2. Both types can also cause sores on your genitals and can be spread by oral sex. Type 1 usually causes cold sores, and type 2 mostly causes genital herpes, but either can be found in both areas. Certain things can trigger an outbreak, including: Some foods Stress Fever Colds Allergies Fatigue Sunburn or being in strong sunlight Dental work or cosmetic surgery Your period Cold Sore Risk Factors Cold sores generally aren’t serious, but the infection may be life-threatening for someone who has a weakened immune system because of AIDS, another condition, or medications. If you have a serious case of the skin condition eczema, you may get cold sores over large parts of your body. Cold Sore Diagnosis Your doctor might diagnose a cold sore just by looking at the blisters. They can also swab the blister and test the fluid for HSV. Cold Sore Treatment There’s no cure for cold sores . Once you have the virus, it stays in your body. The sores themselves usually heal on their own in 1 or 2 weeks. Antiviral medications can speed healing, especially if you take them at the first sign of an outbreak. Your doctor might tell you to use: Cream that you apply on the sores. Acyclovir (Zovirax) and penciclovir (Denavir) require a prescription, or you can get docosanol (Abreva) over the counter. Pills you swallow, like acyclovir (Sitavig, Zovirax), famciclovir (Famvir), or valacyclovir (Valtrex). You need a prescription to get these. Medicine injected into your bloodstream (called intravenous or IV), such as cidofovir (Vistide) or foscarnet (Foscavir), if you have a serious case. Acyclovir can also be injected. Some home remedies can help you feel better while you heal: Cold, damp compresses Over-the-counter pain medicines like acetaminophen and ibuprofen Cream painkillers with benzocaine or lidocaine Treatments with alcohol to dry out the blisters Lip balms and creams to keep moisture in Cold Sore Complications Complications from a cold sore are rare, but can happen if the virus spreads to another part of your body, including your: Fingers. This infection is called herpes whitlow. Genitals. You might have warts or ulcers on your genitals or anus. Other areas of skin. If you have eczema and get a cold sore, see your doctor right away to avoid a serious condition called eczema herpeticum. This painful rash covers large areas of skin. Eyes. HSV keratitis, an infection in your cornea, can cause blindness. Brain or spinal cord. The virus can cause dangerous inflammation called meningitis or encephalitis, especially in people who have weakened immune systems. Cold Sore Prevention To lower your risk of another outbreak: Get plenty of rest. A lack of sleep weakens your immune system , so you get sick more easily. Wear lip balm with sunscreen. Look for SPF on the label. Talk with your doctor. If you get sores often, they might have you take an antiviral medicine every day. To keep from spreading the virus, when you have cold sores, don't: Kiss anyone Share eating utensils, glasses, towels, lipstick or lip balm, or razors Have oral sex Keep in mind that you can spread the virus even if you don't have symptoms."
60,Colic in Babies,"What Is Colic? Colic is when an infant who isn’t sick or hungry cries for more than 3 hours a day, more than 3 days a week, for more than 3 weeks. The condition is a bit of a mystery, but experts agree on a few things: Colicky babies are usually fussier in the evenings. Colic almost always goes away on its own when babies are 3 or 4 months old. It can happen to any baby, whether you breastfeed or bottle-feed. Kids who had colic grow up no differently from those who didn’t. When does colic start? Colic usually starts when babies are 2 weeks old if they're full-term, or later if they're born prematurely. It gets worse between 4 and 6 weeks old. Colic Causes Doctors don’t know exactly what causes colic. Some theories about why it happens include: A growing digestive system with muscles that often spasm Gas Hormones that cause belly pain or crankiness Sensitivity to light or noise Too much stimulation A developing nervous system An early form of childhood migraine Fear, frustration, or excitement Inability to self-soothe Milk allergy Many health conditions can look like colic. If you're worried about your baby, your doctor can do a full exam to rule out other problems like: An infection Acid reflux or stomach problems Sensitivity to formula or breast milk Pressure or inflammation in their brain and nervous system Eye trouble, like a scratch or increased pressure Uneven heartbeat Injury to bones, muscles, or fingers Colic Symptoms Infants often show signs of colic at the same time every day, usually in the evening. Colicky crying sounds different than normal infant crying. If your baby has colic, their crying may: Sound urgent without a clear reason, such as hunger or a dirty diaper Be high-pitched and loud, like they’re in pain Last for several hours Babies with colic also have symptoms like: Clenched fists, stiff arms, and bright red face when they cry Burping and passing a lot of gas A tight belly Colic Diagnosis There’s no test for colic. Your baby ’s doctor will ask you about their symptoms and medical history. The doctor will do a physical exam, focusing on things like your baby's: Energy level Skin tone Breathing Body temperature Weight The doctor also might order some tests to rule out other problems. Colic Treatment Because there’s no clear cause of colic, there’s no single way to treat it. What helps one baby might not help yours. Just remember that it's normal for your baby to cry, so if you can understand their different cries, that may help you deal with colic. Here are some suggestions to help soothe your infant: Make sure they're not hungry, but don't overfeed them. If you’re breastfeeding , ask your doctor if your medications or foods might cause irritation or an allergic reaction in your baby. Change their body positions often. Rock them or massage their back and tummy. Talk or sing softly to your baby. Use a pacifier. Swaddle your baby in a soft blanket. Hold them with their bare skin against yours. Use white noise (like a fan) or a recording of a heartbeat. Take them for a car ride or on a long walk. Put them in a swing or vibrating seat. Give them a warm bath . How long does colic last? The symptoms of colic do eventually get better on their own. Usually it's around the time your baby is about 4 months old, but symptoms can last until they're 6 months. Talk to your baby's doctor if their symptoms don't improve. Colic Complications Because colic resolves itself, there usually aren't many complications for your baby. Most of the problems are for parents dealing with the stress of having a colicky baby, which can cause issues like: Increased risks of postpartum depression for mothers Feelings of powerlessness, guilt, and exhaustion Ending breastfeeding earlier than desired Shaken baby syndrome When to Call a Doctor If your baby is showing signs of colic, be sure they don't have any other medical problems. Symptoms it could be something else include: At 3 months old they still have colic. They won't take their bottle or they're drinking less milk than usual. They're crying a lot and you can't calm them. Call your baby's doctor immediately if they have any of these symptoms: Their behavior or crying pattern suddenly changes A fever of 100.4 F or higher Vomiting or diarrhea Bloody poop Difficulty breathing Parent Self-Care for Colic Stress When your baby has colic, it can be very challenging as a parent. You're probably overwhelmed, angry, or guilty. These feelings don’t make you a bad parent. Remember that it will get better and you have to take care of yourself, too. It’s OK to put your baby in a crib or playpen for 10 minutes or so while you leave the room to collect yourself. Whenever possible, ask friends, family, or babysitters for help when you need a break. Lowering your own stress level will help your baby, too. Talk to your doctor or get help if you're overwhelmed or have thoughts of harming your baby."
61,Ulcerative Colitis Treatment,"How Is Ulcerative Colitis Treated? Treatment for ulcerative colitis can include medicine, changes in your diet, or surgery. These treatments won't cure your ulcerative colitis, unless you have surgery that removes the colon and rectum, which is considered curative, but they can help ease your symptoms. It's important to get treated for ulcerative colitis as soon as you start having symptoms. If you have severe diarrhea and bleeding, you might need to go the hospital to prevent or treat dehydration , reduce your symptoms, and make sure you're getting the right nutrition . Medications for Ulcerative Colitis Your doctor may suggest several types of medicines to curb inflammation in your bowel, including sulfa drugs, corticosteroids, immunosuppressive agents, and antibiotics . 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA). Balsalazide , mesalamine , olsalazine , and sulfasalazine are the main medications used to treat ulcerative colitis. They come in pills and suppositories . Let your doctor know if you are allergic to sulfa before taking one of these drugs. They can prescribe a sulfa-free 5-ASA. Corticosteroids. These anti-inflammatory drugs can be used if 5-ASA drugs don't work for you or if you have a more severe disease. These medicines sometimes have side effects and long-term complications, so doctors often suggest them for short periods of time to help you get in remission. Your doctor may then prescribe you a 5-ASA medication to keep your symptoms away for a longer period. Immunosuppressants. If corticosteroids or 5-ASA drugs don't help, your doctor may prescribe these kinds of drugs, such as 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), azathioprine ( Azasan , Imuran ), cyclosporine , and tacrolimus ( Astagraf XL , Envarsus XR , Prograf ). Biologics. This group of drugs includes adalimumab ( Humira ), plus adalimumab-atto (Amjevita) and adalimumab -adbm (Cyltezo), which are biosimilars to Humira; certolizumab pegol ( Cimzia ), golimumab ( Simponi , Simponi Aria ), infliximab ( Remicade ), infliximab-abda ( Renflexis ), infliximab-axxq ( Avsola ), infliximab-dyyb ( Inflectra ), a biosimilar to Remicade , infliximab-qbtx (IXIFI), ustekinumab ( Stelara ), and vedolizumab ( Entyvio ). Janus kinase inhibitors ( JAK inhibitors ) . These are oral medicines that can work quickly to get and maintain a remission in ulcerative colitis. Tofacitinib ( Xeljanz ) is the first JAK inhibitor that is FDA-approved for the treatment of ulcerative colitis. Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulators . Ozanimod (Zeposia) is an oral medication and is the first  sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator approved for patients with moderately to severely active UC. Newer medications being studied include a group called sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulators. These can be taken by mouth. Researchers think they may get around the anti-drug antibodies that sometimes form with medications given as a shot. Antibodies are proteins that cancel out viruses, bacteria, and other things your body doesn’t recognize . Diet Changes for Ulcerative Colitis While food doesn't appear to play a role in causing ulcerative colitis, certain foods may cause more symptoms when your disease is active. Your doctor may suggest diet changes, depending on your symptoms. They may also recommend vitamins or nutritional supplements . DID YOU KNOW Newer medications being studied include a group called sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulators. Surgery for Ulcerative Colitis Some people get surgery to remove part or all of the colon. Your doctor may suggest this if your medicine isn't working, your symptoms get worse, or your ulcerative colitis leads to serious complications. When you have an operation to remove your entire colon, the surgeon most often creates an opening, or stoma, in your belly wall. They attach a bag there and bring the tip of your lower small intestine through the opening. Waste passes through it and collects in a pouch, which gets attached to the stoma. You'd need to wear the pouch all the time. A newer surgery, called a pelvic pouch or ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA), doesn't create a permanent opening. Instead, a surgeon removes your colon and rectum, and your small intestine is used to form an internal pouch or reservoir that serves as a new rectum. This pouch is connected to the anus . A procedure called a continent ileostomy (Kock pouch) is done if you want your external pouch converted to an internal one, or if you can't get the IPAA operation. In this procedure, there is a stoma but no bag. Your surgeon removes your colon and rectum and creates an internal reservoir from your small intestine. They make an opening in your belly wall and join the reservoir to your skin with a nipple valve. To drain the pouch, you insert a catheter through the valve into the internal reservoir. Other techniques are also available. All surgeries carry some risk and complications. If you have been told you need surgery to treat ulcerative colitis, you may want to get a second opinion to make sure you get the best option for you. When Should I Call My Doctor About Ulcerative Colitis? Call your doctor right away if you have: Heavy, persistent diarrhea Rectal bleeding with clots of blood in your stool Constant pain and a high fever Complementary Treatments and Therapies You may consider these approaches in addition to what your doctor prescribes. But it’s important to talk to your medical team about any and all of them because some, like supplements, can interfere with treatments from your doctor. Let’s take a look at a few: Mind-body therapies: Stress and anxiety are well-known triggers for many people with ulcerative colitis, so it is not surprising that mind-body relaxation techniques could help. These techniques help nurture a healthy connection between your mind and body as well as between you and the outside world. In some cases, they encourage behavior changes in your everyday life. They may be worthwhile if only to lessen anxiety and depression linked to UC and improve quality of life. In addition, there is some evidence that yoga , meditation , and gut-centered hypnotherapy could help with some physical symptoms or flare-ups of UC. Some of the techniques, like cognitive behavioral therapy (a type of psychotherapy ) and patient support groups, have been so successful that they have slowly become a part of mainstream treatment for IBD . Vitamins and supplements: Many people with ulcerative colitis may not absorb enough of some vitamins or minerals from food because of their disease. In these cases, your doctor may suggest taking certain supplements. Still, it’s important to speak with your doctor before you decide to take any on your own. Many of these substances can be unsafe, particularly if you have UC and you’re taking other medicines. Some people also take certain supplements in the belief that they help control UC symptoms. These might include: Fish oil : In foods, the omega-3 fatty acids found in fish , walnuts, flaxseed , and vegetable oils are good for your health. They lessen inflammation and help protect the heart , among other benefits. Some people with UC take omega-3 supplements in the form of fish oil capsules to lessen gut inflammation. Research has so far been unclear on whether this works. Too much fish oil may be bad for you and could be dangerous if you take it with blood thinners like warfarin ( Coumadin ). Turmeric: This spice, commonly used in Indian and South Asian cooking, has a chemical called curcumin that may help lessen inflammation in some people. Some small studies show that it could help with UC flare-ups in capsule form, but scientists need to do more research to be sure of these results. Also, many of the studies used very pure curcumin compounds that may not be available in retail brands. Curcumin can also have side effects that include bloating , nausea , and diarrhea. It also thins the blood and has not been tested for safety in pregnant women. Probiotics : These are “good” bacteria found in many foods that add to the healthy balance of bacteria in your gut. In supplement form, some studies suggest they could help bring a UC flare-up to an end and keep it there, especially if you have a pouch (from J-pouch surgery) that is inflamed. Still, it’s important to take care. There are a wide variety of probiotic products on the market, and much more study is needed. Keep in mind that the FDA doesn't regulate supplements, so claims on packaging may not be accurate. That’s yet another reason why it’s important to talk to your doctor before you start taking any supplements for your UC."
62,Coronavirus and COVID-19: What You Should Know,"Editor's note: For the latest updates on the 2023 coronavirus outbreak, see our news coverage . What Is COVID-19? COVID-19 is a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 that can trigger what doctors call a respiratory tract infection. In early 2020,  the World Health Organization identified SARS-CoV-2 as a new type of coronavirus . The outbreak quickly spread around the world.  It can affect your upper respiratory tract ( sinuses , nose, and throat) or lower respiratory tract (windpipe and lungs ). It spreads the same way other coronaviruses do, mainly through person-to-person contact. Infections range from mild to deadly. SARS-CoV-2 is one of seven types of coronavirus, including the ones that cause severe diseases like Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and sudden acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The other coronaviruses cause most of the colds that affect us during the year but aren't a serious threat to otherwise healthy people. Is there more than one strain of SARS-CoV-2? Yes, the COVID-19 virus continues to mutate and there are several variants that are now spreading. Some are more contagious as well as more deadly than the original virus. Throughout the pandemic, scientists have kept a close eye on variants like: Alpha Beta Gamma Delta Epsilon Eta Iota Kappa Omicron N/A Mu Zeta How long will the coronavirus last? There's no way to tell how long the pandemic will continue. There are many factors, including the public's efforts to slow the spread, researchers' work to learn more about the virus, their search for a treatment, and the success of the vaccines. Symptoms of COVID-19 The main symptoms include: Fever Coughing Shortness of breath Trouble breathing Fatigue Chills, sometimes with shaking Body aches Headache Sore throat Congestion/runny nose Loss of smell or taste Nausea Diarrhea The virus can lead to pneumonia , respiratory failure, heart problems, liver problems, septic shock , and death. Many COVID-19 complications may be caused by a condition known as cytokine release syndrome or a cytokine storm. This is when an infection triggers your immune system to flood your bloodstream with inflammatory proteins called cytokines. They can kill tissue and damage your organs. In some cases, lung transplants have been needed. If you notice the following severe symptoms in yourself or a loved one, get medical help right away: Trouble breathing or shortness of breath Ongoing chest pain or pressure Confusion Can't wake up fully Bluish lips or face Strokes have also been reported in some people who have COVID-19. Remember FAST: Face. Is one side of the person's face numb or drooping? Is their smile lopsided? Arms. Is one arm weak or numb? If they try to raise both arms, does one arm sag? Speech. Can they speak clearly? Ask them to repeat a sentence. Time. Every minute counts when someone shows signs of a stroke. Call 911 right away. If you're infected, symptoms can show up in as few as 2 days or as many as 14. It varies from person to person. According to researchers in China, these were the most common symptoms among people who had COVID-19: Fever 99% Fatigue 70% Cough 59% Lack of appetite 40% Body aches 35% Shortness of breath 31% Mucus/phlegm 27% Some people who are hospitalized for COVID-19 also have dangerous blood clots, including in their legs, lungs, and arteries. What to do if you think you have it If you live in or have traveled to an area where COVID-19 is spreading: If you don't feel well, stay home. Even if you have mild symptoms like a headache and runny nose, stay in until you're better. This lets doctors focus on people who are more seriously ill and protects health care workers and people you might meet along the way. You might hear this called self-isolation. Try to stay in a separate room away from other people in your home. Use a separate bathroom if you can. Call the doctor if you have trouble breathing. You need to get medical help as soon as possible. and go to the emergency room. Test yourself or get tested. Home testing kits are available which can help confirm your infection and let you know when it is safe to be around others. Local health officials and their online portals can also advise you where to go for testing and treatment. Follow your doctor's advice and keep up with the news on COVID-19. Between your doctor and health care authorities, you'll get the care you need and information on how to prevent the virus from spreading. For more information about COVID-19, see our FAQ . How do I know if it's COVID-19, a cold, or the flu? Symptoms of COVID-19 can be similar to a bad cold or the flu. Your doctor will suspect COVID-19 if: You have a fever and a cough. You have been exposed to people who have it within the last 14 days. Cold vs. Flu vs. Allergies vs. COVID-19 Symptoms Cold Flu Allergies COVID-19 (can range from moderate to severe) Fever Rare High (100-102 F), Can last 3-4 days Never Common Headache Rare Intense Uncommon Can be present General aches, pains Slight Usual, often severe Never Can be present Tiredness Mild Intense, starts early, c Sometimes Common Longhaul exhaustion Never Usual gone in 2-3 weeks Never Can be present Stuffy/runny nose Common Sometimes Common Has been reported Sneezing Usual Sometimes Usual Has been reported Sore throat Common Common Sometimes Has been reported Cough Mild to moderate Common, can become severe Sometimes Common Loss of smell and taste Sometimes Sometimes Never Has been reported Rash Rare Rare Can Happen Can Happen Pink Eye Can Happen Can Happen Can Happen Can Happen Diarrhea Never Sometimes in children Never Has been reported Shortness of Breath Rare Rare Rare, except for those with allergic asthma In more serious infections Chest Pain Rare In more serious infections Rare In more serious infections ­­ COVID-19 SYMPTOM CHECKER Find Out if You Have Symptoms of Coronavirus (COVID-19) See what to do about your symptoms and whether to call a doctor Is COVID-19 worse than the flu? Unlike the flu, a lot of people aren't immune to the coronavirus, and because it has been mutating with new strains. If you do catch it, the virus triggers your body to make things called antibodies. Researchers are looking at whether the antibodies give you protection against catching it again. The coronavirus has caused higher rates of severe illness and death than the flu. But the symptoms themselves can vary widely from person to person. Is COVID-19 seasonal like the flu? While scientists hoped initially that higher temperatures and humidity levels might help slow the spread of the coronavirus, that was not the case. Experts advise caution and say thorough public health efforts have more influence than weather on the spread.  Also, past flu pandemics have happened year-round. Causes of the New Coronavirus Researchers aren't sure what caused it, and investigations as to its origin are ongoing. There's more than one type of coronavirus. They're common in people and in animals including bats, camels, cats, and cattle. SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is similar to MERS and SARS. They all came from bats. Coronavirus Risk Factors Anyone can get COVID-19, and most infections are mild. The older you are, the higher your risk of severe illness. You also a have higher chance of serious illness if you have one of these health conditions: Chronic kidney disease Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) A weakened immune system because of an organ transplant Obesity Serious heart conditions such as heart failure or coronary artery disease Sickle cell disease Type 2 diabetes Conditions that could lead to severe COVID-19 illness include: Moderate to severe asthma Diseases that affect your blood vessels and blood flow to your brain Cystic fibrosis High blood pressure A weakened immune system because of a blood or bone marrow transplant, HIV, or medications like corticosteroids Dementia Liver disease Pregnancy Damaged or scarred lung tissue (pulmonary fibrosis) Smoking Thalassemia Type 1 diabetes Depression Anxiety Schizophrenia Some children and teens who are in the hospital with COVID-19 have an inflammatory condition that doctors are calling multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. Doctors think it may be linked to the virus. It causes symptoms similar to those of toxic shock and of Kawasaki disease, a condition that causes inflammation in kids' blood vessels. How Are Mood Disorders Linked to Severe COVID-19? If you have preexisting mood disorders, you may be at high risk for hospitalization or death but not necessarily severe COVID-19. That said, having schizophrenia is the biggest risk factor for besides age for COVID mortality. Those with schizophrenia spectrum disorders are prone to metabolic syndrome, which includes increased blood pressure, high blood sugar, and is associated with systemic inflammation. All of which is exacerbated by COVID. Mood and anxiety disorders were not connected to the higher risk, but people living with mental health conditions may have certain symptoms that can interfere with their ability to care for themselves and be engaged in their health decisions. This can make it hard to effectively follow health behaviors like maintaining social distancing or staying in quarantine to reduce the spread of the infection. Moreover, people with mental health and mood disorders are also more likely to have conditions like diabetes and heart problems which are major risk factors for severe COVID-19. There are also several socio-economic reasons why preexisting mood disorders can increase your chances of hospitalization and death if you get COVID-19. This includes: Poverty Lack of access to preventative health care Ability to understand health recommendations Lack of access to affordable health care Living in tight spaces or facilities like nursing homes, homeless shelters, prisons, or psychiatric inpatient units Coronavirus Transmission How does COVID-19 spread? COVID-19 mainly spreads from person to person . People release respiratory fluids during exhalation (e.g., quiet breathing, speaking, singing, exercise, coughing, sneezing) in the form of droplets across a spectrum of sizes. These droplets carry viruses and transmit infection. The largest droplets settle out of the air rapidly, within seconds to minutes. The smallest very fine droplets, and aerosol particles formed when these fine droplets rapidly dry, are small enough that they can remain suspended in the air for minutes to hours. The risk of transmission is greatest within three to six feet of an infectious source where the concentration of these very fine droplets and particles is greatest. If you breathe them in or swallow them, the virus can get into your body. Some people who have the virus don't have symptoms, but they can still spread the virus. While less likely, you can also get the virus from touching a surface or object the virus is on, then touching your mouth, nose, or possibly your eyes. Most viruses can live for several hours on a surface that they land on. OVID-19 can last for several hours on various types of surfaces: Copper (pennies, teakettles, cookware): 4 hours Cardboard (shipping boxes): up to 24 hours Plastic (milk containers, detergent bottles, subway and bus seats, elevator buttons):2 to 3 days Stainless steel (refrigerators, pots and pans, sinks, some water bottles): 2 to 3 days That's why it's important to wash or sanitize your hands regularly and disinfect surfaces to get rid of the virus. Some dogs and cats have tested positive for the virus. A few have shown signs of illness. There's no evidence that humans can catch this coronavirus from an animal, but it appears it can be passed from humans to animals. What is community spread? Doctors and health officials use this term when they don't know the source of the infection. With COVID-19, it usually refers to someone who gets the virus even though they haven't been exposed to someone who has COVID-19. In February 2020, the CDC confirmed a COVID-19 infection in California in a person who had not traveled to an affected area or been exposed to someone with the disease. This marked the first instance of community spread in the U.S. It's likely that person was exposed to someone who was infected but didn't know it. This type of occurrence has been happening with the variants as well. How fast is it spreading? The number of people infected or re-infected by COVID-19 changes every day. See our news story for the latest updates on this developing story. How contagious is the coronavirus? The transmission rate is relatively high. Early research has estimated that one person who has it can spread it to between 2 and 3.5 others. By comparison, one person who has the seasonal flu will pass it to between 1.1 and 2.3 others. The Omicron variant, which is now the dominant strain of COVID-19 in the United States, is highly contagious and spreads faster than the original virus. The CDC reports there is evidence COVID-19 can be transmitted if you get within 6 feet of someone who is infectious for a total of 15 minutes throughout a day. We can work to lower the transmission rate by wearing high-quality face masks when we can't stay 6 feet away from others, washing hands often, keeping common surfaces clean, limiting contact with other people, and getting vaccinated. Can coronavirus be transmitted through groceries, packages, or food? You're much more likely to get COVID-19 from another person than from packages, groceries, or food. If you're in a high-risk group , stay home and use a delivery service or have a friend shop for you. Have them leave the items outside your front door, if you can. If you do your own shopping, wear a high-quality face mask and try to stay at least 6 feet away from other shoppers. Wash your hands for at least 20 seconds before and after bringing things into your home. The coronavirus can linger on hard surfaces, so clean and disinfect countertops and anything else your bags has touched. You can wipe down plastic, metal, or glass packaging with soap and water if you want. There's no evidence that anyone has gotten COVID-19 from food or food containers. Coronavirus Diagnosis Call your doctor or local health department if you think you've been exposed and have symptoms like: Fever of 100 F or higher Cough Trouble breathing Home testing has advanced considerably since the beginning of the pandemic and you can readily test yourself. Otherwise, testing facilities are readily available in most areas. While some require an appointment, others are simply drive-up. Home testing kits are also widely available. A swab test is the most common testing method. It looks for signs of the virus in your upper respiratory tract. You or the person giving the test puts a swab up your nose to get a sample from the back of your nose and throat. That sample usually goes to a lab that looks for viral material, but some areas may have rapid tests that give results in as little as 15 minutes. If there are signs of the virus, the test is positive. A negative test could mean there is no virus or there wasn't enough to measure. That can happen early in an infection. It usually takes 24 hours to get results, but the tests must be collected, stored, shipped to a lab, and processed. The FDA has granted authorizations for several at-home nasal swab tests, which you collect yourself and express ship back to the lab for analysis as well as at-home rapid tests. You can buy these over the counter in pharmacies, at retail stores, or online. At-home tests are also available for free at some local health departments or federally qualified health centers. A swab test can only tell whether you have the virus in your body at that moment. But you may also consider taking an antibody test which can show whether you've ever been exposed to the virus, even if you didn't have symptoms. This is important in officials' efforts to learn how widespread COVID-19 is. In time, it might also help them figure out who's immune to the virus. The FDA is working with laboratories across the country to develop more tests. Coronavirus Prevention Getting vaccinated against COVID-19 is a key part of prevention. But you should also take these steps: Cover your nose and mouth in public. If you have COVID-19, you can spread it even if you don't feel sick. Wear a mask to protect others. This isn't a replacement for social distancing. You still need to keep a 6-foot distance between yourself and those around you. Don't put a face covering on anyone who is: Under 2 years old Having trouble breathing Unconscious or can't remove the mask on their own for other reasons Wash your hands often with soap and water or clean them with an alcohol-based sanitizer. This kills viruses on your hands. Don't touch your face. Coronaviruses can live on surfaces you touch for several hours. If they get on your hands and you touch your eyes, nose, or mouth, they can get into your body. Practice social distancing. Because you can have and spread the virus without knowing it, you should stay home as much as possible. If you do have to go out, stay at least 6 feet away from others. Clean and disinfect. You can clean first with soap and water, but disinfect surfaces you touch often, like tables, doorknobs, light switches, toilets, faucets, and sinks. Use a mix of household bleach and water (1/3 cup bleach per gallon of water, or 4 teaspoons bleach per quart of water) or a household cleaner that's approved to treat SARS-CoV-2. You can check the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) website to see if yours made the list. Wear gloves when you clean and throw them away when you're done. There's no proof that herbal therapies and teas can prevent infection . COVID-19 preparation tips In addition to practicing the prevention tips listed above, you can: Meet as a household or larger family to talk about who needs what. If you have people at a higher risk , ask their doctor what to do. Talk to your neighbors about emergency planning. Join your neighborhood chat group or website to stay in touch. Find community aid organizations that can help with health care, food delivery, and other supplies. Make an emergency contact list. Include family, friends, neighbors, carpool drivers, doctors, teachers, employers, and the local health department. Choose a room (or rooms) where you can keep someone who's sick or who's been exposed separate from the rest of you. Talk to your child's school about keeping up with assignments. Set yourself up to work from home if your office is closed. Reach out to friends or family if you live alone. Make plans for them to check on you by phone, email, or video chat. Can a face mask protect you from infection? A mask is an added layer of protection for everyone, on top of vaccines and social distancing efforts. You can spread the virus when you talk or cough, even if you don't know that you have it or if you aren't showing signs of infection. It's important to wear a high-quality mask in a variety of situations: Wear a mask indoors in public places if you're in an area where there's a high or “substantial” amount of COVID spreading around. That goes for people 2 years old and up. If you have a chronic health condition or you're taking meds that weaken your immune system, wear a mask in indoor public places even if you're fully vaccinated. Do this unless your doctor tells you otherwise. In general, you don't need to wear a mask outside, where it's harder for the coronavirus to spread. But if COVID-19 cases are high in your area, consider wearing one in crowded outdoor places and for outdoor get-togethers that involve close contact with people who aren't fully vaccinated. Anyone should wear a face mask if they're sick and around other people or animals, even at home. Caregivers should use them when cleaning and disinfecting a sick person's bedroom or bathroom. If you need to call 911, put on a mask before medical help arrives. Some people shouldn't wear masks: Kids under 2 years old Someone with a disability who can't wear a mask or can't safely wear one to the disability A person who has a job in which wearing a mask would create a risk to co-workers' health or safety as determined by the workplace risk assessment What are the different types of face masks? You have several options: Cloth masks are washable and reusable. The best ones have multiple layers of breathable fabric and fit snugly over your nose and mouth. It's a good idea to buy ones that come with a nose wire and are made with fabric that can block light. Disposable masks , also called surgical masks, are also widely available. Choose ones that have several layers of non-woven material. Pick a size that fits properly over your nose and mouth and comes with a nose wire. Don't wear one that has gaps around the sides of your face or nose, or has wet or dirty material. N95 respirator masks fit tightly around your face and filter out 95% or more of the smallest particles in the air. It's fine to buy a basic, disposable N95 respirator. Choose one that's high quality and says “NIOSH Approved” on the label. Is it safe to travel during a pandemic? Crowded places can raise your chances of getting COVID-19. It’s important to check the status of COVID-19 transmissions in the area where you travel before you go and take the necessary precautions while there. A few questions may help you decide whether it's safe to travel : Is the coronavirus spreading where you're going? Will you have close contact with other people during the trip? Are you at higher risk of severe illness if you catch the virus? Do you live with someone who has a serious medical condition? Will the place where you'll be staying be cleaned? Will you have access to food and other necessities? If you choose to travel , stay away from sick people. Wash your hands often, and try not to touch your face. Wear a high-quality cloth face mask when you are around other people. How can you help stop the spread of the coronavirus? Because the virus spreads from person to person , it's important to limit your contact with other people as much as possible. and avoid large gatherings. Most states and cities have lifted restrictions but this doesn't mean the virus is gone. Continue to follow safety practices such as wearing a high-quality cloth face mask in public places and washing your hands. The following terms have now become commonplace: Social distancing or physical distancing, keeping space between yourself and other people when you have to go out Quarantine , keeping someone home and separated from other people if they might have been exposed to the virus Isolation , keeping sick people away from healthy people, including using a separate “sick” bedroom and bathroom when possible Precautions should still be followed even if you are vaccinated. Coronavirus Vaccine The CDC recommends that everyone 6 months and older be vaccinated. There are four vaccines , which have been granted FDA approval; Pfizer BioNTech, Moderna, Novavax, and Johnson & Johnson. Pfizer and Moderna have developed bivalent boosters, which are so named because they protect against both the original virus that causes COVID-19 and the Omicron variant BA.4 and BA.5 Top health experts have a preference for the type of vaccine that you choose. They recommend that you choose a vaccine made with mRNA (like the ones from Pfizer and Moderna) or DNA like Noravax rather than the J&J vaccine, which is made differently. The recommendation is endorsed by the CDC and comes from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which reviewed the latest evidence on the effectiveness, safety, and rare side effects of the available vaccines. That said, receiving any COVID-19 vaccine is better than being unvaccinated, experts say. Booster shots of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are recommended for everyone 5 years and older at least 2 months after you've gotten your first two doses. When it comes to boosters, you don't have to stick with same the vaccine you initially got. For example, if your initial doses came from Moderna, you can get a booster dose from Pfizer. COVID-19 vaccines were developed at an unprecedented speed, with testing in humans starting in March 2020. The FDA says that no corners were cut to allow for approval and that the inoculations are safe. The CDC has said it is safe for pregnant women and there's no evidence that antibodies formed from COVID-19 vaccination cause any problems with pregnancy. Coronavirus Treatment There's no specific treatment for COVID-19. People who get a mild case need care to ease their symptoms, like rest, fluids, and fever control. Take over-the-counter medicine for a sore throat, body aches, and fever. But don't give aspirin to children or teens younger than 19. You might have heard that you shouldn't take ibuprofen to treat COVID-19 symptoms. But the National Institutes of Health says people who have the virus can use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or acetaminophen as usual. Antibiotics won't help because they treat bacteria, not viruses. In January 2022, the FDA limited the use of two monoclonal treatments that previously were used to treat COVID-19 infections after it was found that they were not effective against the Omicron variant. These two monoclonal antibody treatments are bamlanivimab and etesevimab (administered together) and REGEN-COV ( casirivimab and imdevimab ). Sotrovimab is the only available monoclonal treatment with activity against the Omicron variant. Many clinical trials are underway to explore treatments used for other conditions that could fight COVID-19 and to develop new ones. A variety of steroid medications are being used including dexamethasone which is used to treat conditions such as arthritis, blood/hormone/immune system disorders, and allergic reactions. More studies on effectiveness are still being conducted. Is there a cure for the coronavirus? There's no cure yet, but researchers are working hard to find one. COVID-19 Outlook Every case is different. You may have mild flu-like symptoms for a few days after exposure, then get better. But some cases can be severe or fatal. Symptoms can also linger for weeks, even if they're mild. More than a third of people older than 18 who have signs of the virus aren't totally recovered 2 or 3 weeks later, according to a CDC survey. Fatigue and cough were the symptoms that were most likely to linger. Some other people who've had COVID-19 develop a condition similar to myalgic encephalomyelitis, also known as chronic fatigue syndrome. They may have brain fog, severe fatigue, pain, trouble thinking, or dizziness. What is the recovery rate for coronavirus? Scientists and researchers are constantly tracking COVID-19 infections and recoveries. But they don't have information about the outcome of every infection. Early estimates predict that the overall COVID-19 recovery rate will be between 97% and 99.75%. Can you get the coronavirus multiple times ? Yes. This is another reason to stay vigilant against becoming infected and transmitting the virus. As with other coronaviruses that only cause colds , you have a period that you're immune, but that goes away over time. That also appears to be the case with this coronavirus. Immunity is estimated to last up to three months. Having COVID-19 usually results in antibodies which should help protect you from re-infection. But the virus continues to mutate and these changes can lead to new variants which allow the risk for re-infection. The CDC is investigating how often reinfections occur, who is at higher risk of reinfection, how soon reinfections take place after a previous infection, and the severity of reinfections compared with initial infections. Past Coronaviruses Are coronaviruses new? Coronaviruses were first identified in the 1960s . Almost everyone gets a coronavirus infection at least once in their life, most likely as a young child. In the United States, regular coronaviruses are more common in the fall and winter, but anyone can come down with a coronavirus infection at any time. The symptoms of most coronaviruses are similar to any other upper respiratory infection, including a runny nose , coughing , sore throat , and sometimes a fever. In most cases, you won't know whether you have a coronavirus or a different cold-causing virus, such as a rhinovirus. You treat this kind of coronavirus infection the same way you treat a cold. Have there been other serious coronavirus outbreaks? Coronaviruses have led to two serious outbreaks: Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). About 858 people have died from MERS, which first appeared in Saudi Arabia and then in other countries in the Middle East, Africa, Asia, and Europe. In April 2014, the first American was hospitalized for MERS in Indiana, and another case was reported in Florida. Both had just returned from Saudi Arabia. In May 2015, there was an outbreak of MERS in South Korea, which was the largest outbreak outside of the Arabian Peninsula. Severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ). In 2003, 774 people died from an outbreak. As of 2015, there were no further reports of cases of SARS."
63,Complications Coronavirus Can Cause,"If you have COVID-19, your symptoms may be relatively mild and manageable at home. That’s true for most people. But if you’re older or have another illness such as diabetes or heart disease , you’re more at risk for the serious form of COVID-19 . Some people -- about 1 in 6 -- will have complications, including some that are life-threatening. Many of these complications may be caused by a condition known as cytokine release syndrome or a cytokine storm. This is when an infection triggers your immune system to flood your bloodstream with inflammatory proteins called cytokines. They can kill tissue and damage your organs, including your lungs, heart, and kidneys. COVID-19 complications may include the following. Acute Respiratory Failure When you have acute respiratory failure , your lungs might not pump enough oxygen into your blood or might not take enough carbon dioxide out. Both of these problems can happen at the same time. Acute respiratory failure has been the leading cause of death for those who have died of COVID-19. Pneumonia Some who catch the new coronavirus get severe pneumonia in both lungs. COVID-19 pneumonia is a serious illness that can be deadly. When you have pneumonia, the air sacs in your lungs become inflamed, making it harder to breathe. Images of very ill COVID-19 patients’ lungs show them filled with fluid, pus, and cell debris. In those cases, patients’ bodies weren’t able to transfer oxygen to the blood to keep their systems working properly. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was one of the most common complications of COVID-19. With ARDS, the lungs are so severely damaged that fluid begins to leak into them. As a result, the body has trouble getting oxygen into the bloodstream. You may need mechanical help to breathe -- such as a ventilator -- until your lungs recover. Acute Liver Injury Most seriously ill patients run the greatest risk of liver damage. It's unclear whether the virus harms the liver or if it happens for another reason,  but besides the lungs, the liver usually suffers the biggest injuries from COVID-19. Acute liver injury and liver failure are life-threatening complications. (“Acute” means it happens suddenly.) Acute Cardiac Injury Many hospitalized with COVID-19 have developed heart problems, including arrhythmias and high levels of other cardiac ailments. But it’s not clear whether the virus itself affected patients’ hearts, or if the damage happened simply because the illness caused such stress on their bodies overall. COVID-19 also may cause cardiac problems that last long after people have recovered from the coronavirus infection. Secondary Infection A secondary infection means that you get an infection unrelated to the first problem you had. In this case, it means someone with COVID-19 gets infected with something else. Sometimes, a person fighting off, ­or recovering from, a virus gets infected by bacteria. Strep and staph are common culprits. This can be serious enough to raise the risk of death. Acute Kidney Injury This is not a common complication, but if it happens, it’s serious. If your kidneys stop working properly, doctors will start treatment to stop the damage. You might get dialysis (in which a machine filters your blood) until your kidneys get back to working normally. But sometimes, the damage doesn’t heal and people get chronic kidney disease , which would need to be managed long-term. Septic Shock Sepsis happens when your body’s reaction to an infection misfires. The chemicals released into your bloodstream to battle the illness don’t trigger the right response, and instead your organs are damaged. If the process isn’t stopped, you can go into what’s called septic shock. If your blood pressure drops too much, septic shock can be fatal. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation When you have disseminated intravascular coagulation, or DIC, the body’s blood-clotting response doesn’t work right. Abnormal clots form, which can lead to internal bleeding or organ failure. DIC is not uncommon among those who have died or COVID. Blood Clots A condition called disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) causes your body’s blood-clotting response to work differently than it should. Unusual clots form, which can lead to internal bleeding or organ failure and death. Those hospitalized with COVID have been found to be more likely to develop clots than those hospitalized with the flu. Some were in patients’ legs (deep vein thrombosis or DVT), lungs (pulmonary embolism or PE), or arteries. But none of the patients had DIC. COVID-19-associated coagulopathy (CAC) is a life-threatening condition caused by the virus. It’s marked by different protein levels in your blood than the ones caused by DIC. Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children A number of children and teens have been hospitalized with a condition called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) or pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome (PMIS) It is linked to the new coronavirus. Symptoms include fever, belly pain, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, headache, and confusion. They’re similar to those of toxic shock syndrome or Kawasaki disease, which causes inflamed blood vessels in children. Chronic Fatigue Some people who’ve had COVID-19 develop a condition similar to chronic fatigue syndrome. They may have a brain fog, severe fatigue, pain, trouble thinking, or dizziness. Rhabdomyolysis This is an extremely rare condition, but it’s one COVID-19 researchers are watching. In rhabdomyolysis, your muscles break down and tissue dies. As cells fall apart, a protein called myoglobin floods your bloodstream. If your kidneys can’t flush it out of your blood quickly enough, it can overwhelm them and cause death.

64,Coronavirus and Asthma,"What’s the Connection Between Coronavirus and Asthma? COVID-19 is a respiratory disease caused by a coronavirus . That means it can affect your lungs , throat, and nose. For people who have asthma , infection with the virus could lead to an asthma attack , pneumonia , or other serious lung disease . One small study shows that asthma doesn’t raise your chances of getting infected with the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. But if you do get sick, your symptoms could be worse than other people’s because you already have trouble breathing . People with conditions such as asthma are encouraged to get the COVID-19 vaccine when it is available to them. There’s no treatment for COVID-19. But there are steps you can take to protect yourself and your loved ones including getting vaccinated. Signs and Symptoms of Coronavirus and Asthma Common COVID-19 symptoms include: Fever Fatigue A dry cough Loss of appetite Body aches Shortness of breath Headache Loss of taste or smell Sore throat Congestion or runny nose Nausea or vomiting Diarrhea Symptoms of asthma include: Chest tightness Coughing Shortness of breath A whistling or wheezing sound when you breathe out The two conditions share some warning signs. If you have shortness of breath, how can you tell what’s causing it? Pay attention to your other symptoms. Early studies have found that 83% to 99% of people with COVID-19 have a fever, although it might be mild. What should you do if you have coronavirus and asthma symptoms? You may worry if you have asthma and get signs of a cold , allergies , or other respiratory problems. Talk to your doctor if you have: A cough Fever Shortness of breath Call your doctor or 911 right away if: Your asthma medicine doesn’t help. You have chest pain or pressure. You have a hard time breathing. You can’t talk because it’s tough to breathe. You feel suddenly confused. Your lips or face are blue. How to Prepare Getting vaccinated can help prevent infection. Keep taking your asthma medicine. Stay home as much as possible. That lowers your chance of coming into contact with the virus. It’s a good idea to have a 30-day supply of food, nonprescription drugs , and other household goods on hand. Your doctor, pharmacist , and insurance company can help you figure out what you need for an emergency supply of prescription medication. Here are some other tips: Know how to use your inhaler . Clean your nebulizer well. Stay away from asthma triggers such as smoke, allergens, and air pollution. Don’t take cruises or unnecessary flights. Avoid close contact with people. Avoid crowds and people who are sick. Don’t share cups, eating utensils, or towels. If you’re mildly sick, stay home. Always use a tissue to cover your cough or sneeze . Throw that tissue away after you use it. Stay away from people in your house who are sick. If possible, they should stay in a separate room and use another bathroom until they’re better. If they can’t, disinfect any common spaces the ill person uses. You should both wear masks when around each other. A peak flow diary can help you keep track of your asthma symptoms. Ask your doctor or pharmacist about how you can get a peak flow meter, a small device that measures how fast air comes out of your lungs. Write down each day’s readings, how often you use rescue medications and any symptoms you have. This can tell you and your medical team whether your breathing might be getting worse or if your symptoms could be COVID-19. Preventing Complications of Coronavirus and Asthma To prevent complications of coronavirus and asthma: Wash your hands often for at least 20 seconds. That includes your knuckles, thumbs, fingernails, and wrists. If you don’t have soap and water , use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Wash your hands after you: Go out in public Touch a new surface Blow your nose, cough, or sneeze Dry your hands completely after you wash them. And always wash your hands before you touch your eyes , nose, or mouth . You can transfer the virus from your hands to your face. Disinfect anything that’s touched a lot . COVID-19 can live a while on certain surfaces. Studies show that it can stick to plastic and stainless steel for up to 3 days. Try to avoid disinfectants that might trigger your asthma. Items you should regularly disinfect include: Tables and countertops Doorknobs Light switches Phones and desks Keyboards Anything in a bathroom (toilet, faucet, sink) Your lips or face are blue. Consider wearing a mask when you are out in public. Treating Asthma During Coronavirus Corticosteroid drugs can slow your immune system . But experts say the benefits outweigh any risks for people who have asthma. The most important thing is to keep control of your condition. Keep taking your medicine. Never stop or change medications without talking to your doctor first. Rescue drugs like bronchodilators don’t affect your immune system. If you have an asthma flare and need to use medicine, an inhaler is best. A nebulizer might spread the virus through the air if you use it while you’re sick. If you must use a nebulizer, do it in a room by yourself. Coronavirus and Kids With Asthma Children who have asthma may be more likely to have more severe symptoms of any respiratory infection, including COVID-19. Keep your child at home, have them wear masks (if they are over the age of 2) in public, and limit their contact with other people. Remind them to wash their hands often. Help them keep toys and electronics clean. Keep an eye on your child’s symptoms, and call their doctor if you have concerns."
65,Coronavirus and High Blood Pressure: What’s the Link?,"If you have high blood pressure , it's a good idea to take extra care to protect yourself during the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak . There is a possibility that having high blood pressure might put you at greater risk for severe illness and death with COVID-19. High Blood Pressure Risks High blood pressure is the most commonly shared preexisting condition among those hospitalized. Having hypertension can almost double the risk of severe COVID illness or death. Other health conditions include cancer, diabetes, or lung disease. What's the Link? Why people with high blood pressure may be at higher risk for coronavirus is not known. One possibility could be in the relationship between hypertension and the immune system.  Long-term health conditions and aging weaken your immune system so it's less able to fight off the virus. Almost two-thirds of people over 60 have high blood pressure. Another possibility is that the higher risk comes not from high blood pressure itself, but from certain drugs used to treat it -- ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). This theory may come from research that suggests these types of medications weaken the body’s immune cells. But other large studies found no ties between the use of these drugs and how severe COVID-19 is. Still other research suggests that they may make COVID-19 less severe. There’s also no proof that people have less severe illness after stopping them. Stopping these medications may make heart and kidney disease worse. It can also raise your risk of death. The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association recommend that you keep taking your high blood pressure medicine as prescribed. If you don’t, it could raise your risk for a heart attack or stroke , putting you in the hospital just as coronavirus cases are coming in. How Coronavirus Affects People With High Blood Pressure While pneumonia is the most common complication of the virus, it can also damage the cardiovascular system. High blood pressure damages arteries and reduces the flow of blood to your heart. That means your heart has to work harder to pump enough blood. Over time, this extra work can weaken your heart to the point where it can't pump as much oxygen-rich blood to your body. Coronavirus can also damage the heart directly, which can be especially risky if your heart is already weakened by the effects of high blood pressure. The virus may cause inflammation of the heart muscle called myocarditis , which makes it harder for the heart to pump. If you also have plaque buildup in your arteries, the virus may make those plaques more likely to break apart and cause a heart attack. Past studies have shown that people with heart disease who get a respiratory illness like the flu or earlier types of coronavirus are at higher risk for a heart attack. What Should You Do? Everyone needs to take precautions to prevent coronavirus. People with high blood pressure and other health conditions need to be extra careful. The CDC offers this advice: Get vaccinated against COVID-19 from one of the approved vaccines and check the CDC website to make sure that you are up to date on your vaccine booster shots. Make sure you have enough medicine on hand to treat high blood pressure and other health conditions. Stock up on over-the-counter medicines to treat a fever and other symptoms if you get sick. Stay at home and limit contact with other people as much as you can. Avoid crowds and anyone who looks sick. Wear a face mask if you are indoors in public in communities with substantial or high transmission. Wash your hands often with soap and warm water. Clean and disinfect all frequently touched surfaces like countertops and doorknobs. NEWSLETTER Stay Up-to-Date on COVID-19 Sign up for the latest coronavirus news."
66,Coronavirus and Pregnancy,"When you're pregnant , you'd expect to have all kinds of questions and worries. But “What if I get coronavirus ?” probably wasn't one of them. Doctors and scientists are still learning how the virus affects everyone , including expectant mothers and their unborn babies. Here's what they know -- and don't know. COVID-19 and Pregnancy Does pregnancy make me more likely to have a severe case if I get COVID-19? Yes. While in general, your overall risk of getting seriously ill is low, your chances of getting severely ill from COVID-19 are higher while you're pregnant. You are also at risk for about 42 days afterward giving birth. Pregnant people who have COVID-19 with symptoms are more likely than non-pregnant people who have COVID-19 to need treatment in an intensive care unit, need a ventilator to help with breathing, or to die from the disease. In addition, pregnant people with COVID-19 are also at increased risk for delivering the baby earlier than 37 weeks and might be at increased risk for other poor pregnancy outcomes. A few of the things that can raise your risk of getting severely ill are: Certain health conditions, like obesity or gestational diabetes Being older Social, economic, and health inequalities What should I do if I have symptoms of COVID-19 or if I come into contact with someone who has the virus? If you're exposed to the virus, call your doctor and let them know what happened. They'll probably tell you to watch for signs of illness such as a fever or a cough . If you get these symptoms, call your doctor to talk about where to go for testing. Protecting Your Baby How do I keep myself and my baby as safe as possible? You can keep safe by getting vaccinated. Experts say the benefits of the COVID-19 vaccine outweigh any known or potential risks of the vaccine during pregnancy. The COVID-19 vaccine is recommended for people who are pregnant, breastfeeding, trying to get pregnant, or may become pregnant in the future. Currently, there isn’t any evidence that suggests the COVID-19 vaccine causes fertility issues in women or men. It's possible to have mild side effects after you get vaccinated, especially after the second shot of a two-dose vaccine, like Pfizer and Moderna. But there haven't been reports of pregnant people getting different side effects after receiving those vaccines from those who aren't pregnant. If you run a fever after getting vaccinated, take acetaminophen and call your doctor right away. A prolonged high fever is linked to worse pregnancy outcomes. Also, call the doctor if you think you're having an allergic reaction. Those are rare, and you can get treatment for them. Before you get vaccinated, let your doctor know if you've had allergic reactions to other vaccines or shots in the past. If you're pregnant and you have questions about the COVID-19 vaccines, talk to your doctor. If you think you have symptoms, call your doctor. They may prescribe an antiviral medication, monoclonal antibodies, or they might recommend that you take acetaminophen to keep your fever down. It's important to rest and drink lots of fluids. You probably won't need to go to the hospital. Call your doctor right away if your symptoms get worse, especially if you have trouble breathing . If I get the coronavirus before I deliver, can it hurt my baby? There's no evidence that the virus itself can lead to birth defects, miscarriage , or any other problems. But a fever in early pregnancy, from COVID-19 or any other cause, can raise the chances of birth defects. And severe lung illnesses late in your pregnancy can make you more likely to deliver your baby prematurely. Some babies born to women who had coronavirus were born preterm. But it's not clear whether the virus was to blame. If I have the coronavirus, can I pass it to my baby during pregnancy or delivery? Some newborns have tested positive for COVID-19. But that doesn't necessarily mean they picked it up from their mothers in the womb. The most common way to get COVID-19 is through respiratory droplets that a sick person coughs or sneezes. Experts believe it's more likely that infected babies picked it up through droplets after birth from their mother or a caregiver. If I have coronavirus, can I breastfeed my baby? Evidence suggests that the coronavirus is not spread through breast milk. That doesn't mean you can't pass on the virus through coughing or sneezing while nursing. The safest option may be to pump and have someone who isn't infected feed your baby. If you really want to nurse your baby yourself, wash your hands before breastfeeding , and consider wearing a face mask . Take these same precautions while bottle-feeding your baby. Coronavirus Prevention While Pregnant Should I take any extra steps to protect myself besides the ones the CDC and state and local government recommend for everyone? There's no evidence that pregnancy makes you any more likely to get coronavirus. Still, it's a serious threat to everyone. You should take all the recommended steps to avoiding getting sick. Those include washing your hands often, not touching your face, staying at least 6 feet away from other people, and avoiding groups . Wear a high end face mask when you're in public places like stores and doctor's offices. Should I travel? Crowded places like airports might raise your chances of getting infected with the coronavirus. Many doctors recommend against traveling during the pandemic. Talk with your doctor about the risks, and check guidelines from local and federal health officials. Should I reschedule my baby shower? The CDC urges everyone to practice social distancing to slow the spread of the virus when case levels are high in your community. This means limiting your contact with other people in homes and in public places like parks or restaurants. It's safest to postpone your shower or hold an online get-together instead. Should I have prenatal visits? Talk to your medical team before your appointments. They might want you to come in less often or to have checkups on the phone or online. They may recommend that you keep track of your baby's movements and get a cuff to measure your blood pressure . What to Expect With Delivery If I have the coronavirus, will my delivery still go as planned? There's no evidence that women with COVID-19 shouldn't deliver vaginally. But delivery might be different from what you expected. One group of experts suggests that if the mother has COVID-19, it might be helpful to leave the vernix -- a white, waxy coating on newborns' skin -- on for 24 hours after birth. The coating contains antimicrobial substances that could protect against infection. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that babies born to women who have the coronavirus be isolated and monitored for symptoms. Whether or not you have coronavirus, the ongoing pandemic means many hospitals are limiting the number of visitors to one or none. At home, before and after your baby arrives, you should stick to your social distancing plan and avoid visitors as much as possible. Will I get the care and attention I need during my delivery? You should expect to get usual care during your delivery. It's unlikely that hospitals would call obstetricians away from their regular duties in labor and delivery in order to provide care somewhere else. If you have questions, ask your obstetrics team."
67,Coronavirus in Kids and Babies,"What’s My Child’s Risk of Getting the Coronavirus? Children can get the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, but their symptoms tend to be milder than adults’ symptoms, and in many cases, they may have no symptoms at all. Their risk of getting COVID-19 is about the same as that of adults. The risk can be drastically reduced if your child receives the COVID-19 vaccine. COVID-19 may cause more serious illness in children who have certain medical conditions and in babies younger than 12 months. In some cases, children develop multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C), which is a serious condition that requires medical attention (more below). Some very simple and effective ways to help prevent your child from catching or spreading COVID-19 are: Have them wash their hands often. Clean your home often. Keep your child away from sick people. Know the COVID-19 level in your community, a statistic that is constantly updated by the CDC. Follow CDC recommendations as far as precautions such as masking. Have them vaccinated You’ll also want to reassure your child if they’re anxious about any changes in their routines, like staying home from school or not seeing friends face-to-face. Watch for unusual worry or sadness, trouble eating or sleeping, and attention problems. Talk to them about what’s happening, and reassure them that most cases of COVID-19 are mild. Your children will pick up cues from you, so it’s important that you stay calm, too. Are COVID-19 Symptoms Different in Children and Adults? When children and teens get sick with COVID-19, their symptoms appear to be similar to adults. There have been fewer hospitalizations among people in the U.S. under the age of 19. Research shows that over 90% of children who get sick have very mild to moderate cold-like symptoms that include: Fever Runny nose Cough Vomiting Diarrhea Some children and teens have been hospitalized with a condition called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) or pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome (PMIS). Doctors are still learning about it, but they think it’s linked to COVID-19. Symptoms include fever, belly pain, vomiting, diarrhea, rash , headache , and confusion. They’re similar to those of toxic shock syndrome or Kawasaki disease , which causes inflamed blood vessels in children. Serious problems are rare. Get medical help right away if your child shows any of these symptoms: Trouble breathing Can't keep liquids down Changes in skin color, including blue lips or face Confusion or trouble waking up Coronavirus in Children With Medical Conditions Some children may be at higher risk for more severe disease if they have other medical conditions such as: Asthma Diabetes Blood disorders Heart or liver disease Kidney disease that needs dialysis A weakened immune system How Can I Protect My Children From the Coronavirus? The CDC has recommended that everyone 6 months and older should get the COVID-19 vaccine to protect against the coronavirus. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are approved for ages 6-months and older. The CDC also recommends a booster with the bilvalent vaccine 2 months after their most recent vaccination to cover the more current variants of coronavirus. But getting the vaccine does not ensure that your child will not get infected. It’s important to do everything you can to protect your child and the rest of your family from disease. Here are ways to cut their risk of illness: Wear masks indoors in public. People can spread the coronavirus even when they don’t have symptoms or before symptoms start. To slow the spread, the CDC says everyone over the age of 2 should wear a mask indoors when they’re in a public place if they have not been fully vaccinated or if the level of COVID-19 spreading in your community is high. The CDC has a tool to help you track the COVID-19 community level where you live . Fit is important, so buy masks that are sized for small faces. Try on masks at home so children have time to get used to them. Make sure your child doesn’t touch the mask while wearing it. Wash hands often. All kids should wash their hands: After they go to the bathroom After they sneeze , cough, or blow their nose Before they eat As soon as they enter the house Soap and water are best. Make sure they lather the backs of their hands, between their fingers, and under their nails for at least 20 seconds (the same amount of time it takes to sing “Happy Birthday” two times). If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Stay home, and no playdates in person. When levels of coronavirus are high in your area, it’s important to limit close contact with others to reduce the spread of the disease. Stay home as much as possible, and avoid public places like shopping malls and movie theaters. Don’t have playdates or sleepovers. Your child may not seem sick, but they may still have the virus and can pass it to others. Keep your kids away from others who are ill. And if your child has cold-like symptoms, keep them home. Teach them to cough and sneeze into a tissue that they toss after each use, or into their arm or elbow instead of their hands. Clean your home regularly. Disinfect high-touch surfaces like toilets, sinks, doorknobs, light switches, handles, smartphones, tablets, and TV remotes every day. You can use most regular household cleaners, or make your own by mixing a quarter cup of bleach with a gallon of water. If your child has a favorite stuffed animal or plush item, wash it frequently at the highest possible temperature. Take care if you get sick. A new mom who tests positive for COVID-19 or thinks she could have it might choose to temporarily stay away from her baby in order to lower the chances of spreading the virus. Talk about the pros and cons with your medical team. If you go this route and still want to breastfeed , you can pump breast milk and have a healthy caregiver feed your child. If you might be sick but don’t want to separate from your baby , take extra steps to avoid spreading the virus. Wash your hands often, and wear a face mask when you’re 6 feet away or closer, including when nursing. Variants and Children The number of children with COVID-19 has dramatically spiked with the Omicron variant. To ensure their safety, it’s important to have your kids fully vaccinated against COVID-19. To keep your young ones safe: Have your child wear a mask in crowded areas, even if they’re vaccinated. If possible, allow children to social distance. Try to avoid crowded indoor activities. Take your children to outdoor events. Keep windows open, if the weather allows, to create more ventilation. Be cautious around older people and those with underlying conditions. If your child is too young to get the vaccine, ensure that all others in your household get vaccinated. What’s the Treatment for Young Children With COVID-19? There’s one FDA-approved COVID-19 treatment for certain kids under 12 years old. It’s a shot called remdesivir ( Veklury ). It’s for children 28 days of age and older who weigh about 7 pounds at least, and are either: In the hospital due to COVID-19 Not hospitalized but have mild to moderate COVID-19 and are at high risk for the disease becoming severe Remdesivir can cause side effects. There’s a chance it could raise a child’s levels of liver enzymes , which may be a sign of liver injury. It could also trigger an allergic reaction , which may include signs like: Changes in blood pressure and heart rate Low blood oxygen level Fever Shortness of breath Wheezing Swelling of the lips, around the eyes , under the skin, or other body parts Rashes Nausea Sweating Shivering Get medical help right away if you think your child is having side effects. Dial 911 if they’re having trouble breathing . Paxlovid is used to treat adults and children 12 and older (weighing at least 88 pounds) who have mild-to-moderate COVID-19 and high risk of the disease becoming severe. Paxlovid should be taken as soon as possible after you’re diagnosed and within 5 days of your symptoms starting. Remdesivir and Paxlovid are not substitutes for the COVID-19 vaccine in children who are eligible. Your child should still get the COVID vaccine if they are 6-months or older. What to Do if Your Child Gets Sick With COVID-19 If your child has symptoms that you think might be COVID-19, call a doctor. They can tell you what to do and whether the doctor needs to see your child in person. Don’t just show up at the doctor’s office -- call first. In the event that your child has COVID-19, they’ll likely stay at home to recover. Your child should rest and drink plenty of fluids. Never use aspirin in children younger than 19. It increases their risk of a serious condition called Reye’s syndrome. You may want to try giving your child an over-the-counter pain reliever that’s a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID), such as ibuprofen or naproxen . Acetaminophen may be a safer option. To make sure the rest of the family doesn’t get sick: Separate them. Your child should stay away from the other people in your home -- ideally, in a specific room and bathroom. They shouldn’t snuggle or kiss family pets, either. If your child has COVID-19, they should wear a face mask when they’re around other people. If that makes it harder for them to breathe , or they get upset, you can instead wear one when you’re with them. Don’t share personal items with them. This includes things like drinking glasses, towels, and bedding. Clean and disinfect constantly. If your sick child is old enough to clean high-touch areas like phones, doorknobs, and toilets themselves, let them. Otherwise, do it yourself but wear a mask. Track their symptoms. Call your doctor right away if your child has trouble breathing, has chest pressure or pain, or seems confused. Keep them isolated even if they seem better. Your child can be around other people once they have had a full day with no fever -- without the use of fever-reducing medication -- their other symptoms have improved, and it’s been at least 5 days since they got sick. They need to keep wearing a mask when they’re around other people for another 5 days, for a total of 10 days. If they can’t wear a mask, they should remain isolated for a full 10 days.

68,Coronavirus Recovery,"Most people who get COVID-19, the disease caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2, will have only mild illness. But what exactly does that mean? Mild COVID-19 cases still can make you feel lousy. But you should be able to rest at home and recover fully without a trip to the hospital. Here’s what to expect and how to take care of yourself. Coronavirus Recovery Rates Scientists and researchers are constantly tracking infections and recoveries. But they have data only on confirmed cases, so they can’t count people who don’t get COVID-19 tests. Experts also don’t have information about the outcome of every infection. On average about 98.2% of known COVID-19 patients in the U.S. survive, but each individual’s chance of dying from the virus will vary depending on their age, whether they have an underlying health condition and whether they are vaccinated. While people who are vaccinated can still get infected, these “breakthrough” cases are rare, and vaccines dramatically reduce severe illness and death. How You Might Feel While Recovering Not everyone who catches COVID-19 will notice symptoms. If you do get them, they may show up 2 to 14 days after your infection. And those symptoms can vary from one person to the next. One of the most common signs is a fever , which for most adults is 100.4 F or higher. It means your body is trying to fight off an invader. About 50% of people who become ill have a dry cough . That’s the kind that doesn’t bring up any mucus or phlegm . But about a third have a cough with mucus . You also might feel very tired . Less commonly, your throat may be sore and your head might ache. Your muscles and joints could hurt, and you might get chills , nausea , vomiting, or diarrhea . Some people who had COVID-19 said they had trouble taking deep breaths and felt like they had a tight band wrapped around their chest. Others have likened the illness to a bad cold . Still, others said it was the sickest they’d ever felt. Loss of smell and taste have been reported in many cases. Some patients have skin rashes and darkened toes, called “COVID toes.” You might feel short of breath as if you’d just run to grab a ringing phone. If so, call your doctor to ask about what you should do. What’s the Recovery Time for Coronavirus? Early research suggested that it could take 2 weeks for your body to get over a mild illness or up to 6 weeks for severe or critical cases. Recovery varies for different people, depending on things like your age and overall health. Fatigue, headache, and trouble breathing were the symptoms most likely to linger. CDC guidelines say that if you’ve been sick, you should isolate yourself at home until all of these things are true: You haven’t had a fever for 24 hours without using a fever-reducing medicine. Your symptoms are better, though they might not be totally gone. It’s been at least 5 days since your symptoms started. Regardless of when you end isolation, until at least day 11: Avoid being around people who are more likely to get very sick from COVID-19. Remember to wear a high-quality mask when indoors around others at home and in public. Do not go places where you are unable to wear a mask until you are able to discontinue masking Recovery After Severe Illness With COVID-19 A small percentage of people who have the new coronavirus need to stay in the hospital to get help breathing. It may depend on things like your age and your overall health. This might last 2 weeks or more. Some people who have severe COVID-19 get a complication called acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which can damage your lungs and make it very hard to breathe. If you’re severely ill, you might need treatment in an intensive care unit (ICU). Many patients who spend time in the ICU lose weight and strength. Your medical team will work with you to treat or manage these symptoms, including exercises to boost your strength. Long COVID Long COVID happens when a range of symptoms linger after recovery, and affect your quality of life. Experts estimate that 13 million Americans have long COVID. You may notice symptoms like: Mild headaches Overall feeling of being unwell Fatigue Trouble concentrating Shortness of breath If you’ve noticed symptoms of long COVID, or you begin to feel worse and develop new symptoms, call your doctor. Recovery Outlook After you recover from COVID-19, it’s likely that you’ll have some protection from reinfection. But reinfection does happen. The CDC continues to learn more about: Who could be at a higher risk of reinfection How common are reinfections How severe a reinfection is compared to your first case How quickly a reinfection can occur after you recover Transmission risks to others after reinfection How to Feel Better There’s no cure for COVID-19, although if you have to stay in the hospital, some medicines may shorten your recovery. Some of the things you can do to speed your healing are similar to how you might take care of the flu or a bad cold. Eat healthy foods. If you feel like eating, fuel your body with the vitamins and nutrients it needs to get better. Limit sugary or highly processed foods like cookies and sodas. If you don’t have an appetite, you don’t need to try to force food down. Drinks lots of fluids. Do this even if you don’t feel like eating. Water is always a good pick. Lower your fever. Take acetaminophen or ibuprofen if you have a temperature or body aches. Be careful not to take more than a total of 3,000 milligrams every 24 hours, except in the case of pediatric patients. That includes acetaminophen alone as well as in medications like cold and flu pills and syrups. Rest. Know that you’ll probably feel better eventually. If your symptoms do get worse, call your doctor. NEWSLETTER Stay Up-to-Date on COVID-19 Sign up for the latest coronavirus news."
69,Symptoms of Coronavirus,"COVID-19 Symptoms COVID-19 is a respiratory condition caused by a coronavirus. Some people are infected but don’t notice any COVID-19 symptoms (doctors call that being asymptomatic). Most people have mild symptoms and get better on their own. But some have severe problems, such as trouble breathing. The odds of more serious COVID-19 symptoms are higher if you’re older or have another health condition such as diabetes or heart disease. Here’s what to look for if you think you might have the virus. Types of Covid-19 Symptoms COVID-19 symptoms can range from mild to serious. Anyone can have symptoms at any intensity level. You don't have to have an underlying condition to develop severe symptoms. Common COVID-19 symptoms The most common symptoms of COVID-19 include: Fever or chills A dry cough and shortness of breath Feeling very tired Muscle or body aches Headache A loss of taste or smell Sore throat Congestion Runny nose Nausea Vomiting Diarrhea These symptoms can start anywhere from 2 to 14 days after you’re in contact with the virus. Emergency COVID-19 symptoms You need immediate medical help if you have any of these issues: Trouble breathing Constant pain or pressure in your chest Bluish lips or face Sudden confusion Having trouble staying awake Having a hard time waking up Pale, gray, or bluish skin, lips, or nail beds If you have any of these symptoms, call your doctor’s office or hospital before you go in. This will help them prepare to treat you and protect medical staff and other people. Strokes have also been reported in some people who have COVID-19. To identify signs of stroke, remember FAST: Face. Is one side of the person’s face numb or drooping? Is their smile lopsided? Arms. Is one arm weak or numb? If they try to raise both arms, does one arm sag? Speech. Can they speak clearly? Ask them to repeat a sentence. Time. Every minute counts when someone shows signs of a stroke. Call 911 right away. The FDA has approved the antiviral drug remdesivir (Veklury) and nirmatrelvir with ritonavir ( Paxlovid ) to treat COVID-19 in some people. Molnupiravir (Lagevrio) has been given emergency use authorization for treating the virus. If you have serious COVID-19 symptoms, you should get one of these treatments as soon as possible. COVID-19 SYMPTOM CHECKER Find Out if You Have Symptoms of Coronavirus (COVID-19) See what to do about your symptoms and whether to call a doctor Other COVID-19 symptoms Less common problems that the virus can cause include: Pink eye Swollen eyes Fainting Guillain-Barré syndrome Coughing up blood Blood clots Seizures Heart problems Kidney damage Liver problems or damage Some doctors have reported rashes tied to this virus, including on children’s toes and feet. These rashes may show up as purple or blue lesions on lighter skin or pale or gray on darker skin. Researchers are looking into these reports so they can understand the effect on people who have it. COVID-19 symptoms in children Kids have many of the same COVID-19 symptoms as adults, but they tend to be milder. Some children may not have any symptoms, but can still spread the virus. Common coronavirus symptoms in children include: Fever Cough Shortness of breath Some children and teens who are hospitalized with COVID-19 have an inflammatory syndrome that may be linked to the coronavirus. Doctors call it pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome (PMIS). Symptoms include fever, rash, belly pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and heart problems. It’s similar to toxic shock and Kawasaki disease, a condition in children that causes inflammation in blood vessels. Warning Signs of COVID-19 In some cases, certain symptoms show up before the more obvious signs of the coronavirus. Warning signs to look out for include: Digestive issues. Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea may show up with other symptoms or before them. New loss of smell or taste. This symptom, without a stuffy nose, is a common early warning sign of COVID-19. It may go away within 30 days. But in some cases, it can last 60 days or more. What Are the Symptoms of the Newest COVID-19 Variant? Most variants of the virus have similar symptoms. But a few strains may have slightly different signs. COVID-19 symptoms of Omicron variant COVID-19 Omicron symptoms are usually mild. They tend to include sore throat, runny nose, and other symptoms similar to a cold. They may not include lower respiratory tract symptoms such as wheezing, severe cough, or fever. COVID-19 symptoms of Delta variant With this variant, symptoms usually include runny nose, fever, sore throat, and headache. You're less likely to have coughing or loss of taste or smell. When to Get Tested for COVID-19 Get tested if: You’ve had symptoms of the virus . You’ve come into close contact with a person who has the virus (take a test at least 5 days after you last saw the person). You’ve been asked to get tested by your school, health care provider, workplace, state, local, tribal, or territorial health department (regardless of your vaccination status). How to Check for Fever Your regular body temperature may be higher or lower than someone else’s. It also changes throughout the day. Doctors generally consider a fever in an adult to be anything over 100.4 F on an oral thermometer and over 100.8 F on a rectal thermometer. If you think you’ve come into contact with the virus, or if you have symptoms, isolate yourself and check your temperature every morning and evening for at least 10 days. Keep track of the readings. A fever is the most common COVID-19 symptom, but it’s sometimes below 100 F. In a child, a fever is a temperature above 100 F on an oral thermometer or 100.4 F on a rectal one. What Kind of Cough Is Common in People With Coronavirus? Most people with this virus have a dry cough that they can feel in their chest. What to Do if You Think You Have Mild Symptoms If you have milder COVID-19 symptoms like a fever, shortness of breath, or coughing: Stay home unless you need medical care. If you do need to go in, call your doctor or hospital first for guidance. Tell your doctor about your illness. If you’re at high risk of complications because of your age or other health conditions, they might have more instructions. Isolate yourself. This means staying away from other people as much as possible, including members of your family. Stay in a specific “sick room,” and use a separate bathroom if you can. Wear a face mask if you have to be around anyone else. This includes people you live with. If a mask makes it hard for you to breathe , keep a distance of at least 6 feet from others and cover your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze. After that happens, wash your hands with soap for at least 20 seconds. The CDC states that well-fitting respirator masks (like N95s and KN95s) give better protection than cloth masks. Rest up, and drink plenty of fluids. Over-the-counter medicines might help you feel better. Keep track of your symptoms. If they get worse, get medical help right away. What Does Shortness of Breath Feel Like? Dyspnea is the word doctors use for shortness of breath. It can feel like you: Have tightness in your chest Can’t catch your breath Can’t get enough air into your lungs Can’t breathe deeply Are smothering, drowning, or suffocating Have to work harder than usual to breathe in or out Need to breathe in before you’re done breathing out You should monitor your oxygen levels , and if they drop to the 80s, contact your doctor. If your face and/or lips get a bluish tint, call 911 right away. Is It COVID-19, the Flu, a Cold, or Allergies? Cold vs. Flu vs. Allergies vs. COVID-19 Symptoms Cold Flu Allergies COVID-19 (can range from moderate to severe) Fever Rare High (100-102 F), can last 3-4 days Never Common Headache Rare Intense Uncommon Common General aches, pains Slight Usual, often severe Never Common Fatigue, weakness Mild Intense, can last up to 2-3 weeks Sometimes Common Extreme exhaustion Never Usual (starts early) Never Can be present Stuffy/runny nose Common Sometimes Common Has been reported Sneezing Usual Sometimes Usual Has been reported Sore throat Common Common Sometimes Has been reported Cough Mild to moderate Common, can become severe Sometimes Common Shortness of breath Rare Rare Rare, except for those with allergic asthma In more serious infections How to Protect Yourself The CDC recommends that everyone aged 5 and above get an updated COVID-19 vaccine to keep them from getting seriously ill from the coronavirus. Three updated vaccines are available in the U.S.: Pfizer-BioNTech Moderna Novavax Recommendations by age group are: People aged 12 and above who haven't been vaccinated before: 1 dose of either Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna, or 2 doses of Novavax People aged 12 and above who got coronavirus vaccines before September 12, 2022: 1 dose of any of the 3 newer vaccines Children aged 5-11, regardless of previous vaccine status: 1 dose of Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna Children aged 6 months-4 years who haven't had a coronavirus vaccine before: 2-3 doses of one of the updated vaccines, depending on type Children aged 6 months–4 years who were vaccinated before September 12, 2023: 1 or 2 doses of one of the updated vaccines, depending on which type and how many doses they've had Talk with your doctor before getting the vaccine if you have immune system issues. Until you’re fully vaccinated, be sure to take these steps to prevent illness: Wash your hands often, for at least 20 seconds each time, with soap and water. Use an alcohol-based sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol if you don't have soap and water handy. Limit your contact with other people. Stay at least 6 feet away from others if you have to go out. Wear a well-fitted protective face mask in public places. Avoid people who are sick. Don’t touch your eyes, nose, or mouth unless you’ve just washed your hands. Regularly clean and disinfect surfaces that you touch a lot. NEWSLETTER Stay Up-to-Date on COVID-19 Sign up for the latest coronavirus news. Caring for Someone Who Has COVID-19 Symptoms If you’re taking care of someone with COVID-19 symptoms, follow these steps to protect yourself: Limit your contact as much as you can. Stay in separate rooms. If you have to be in the same room, use a fan or an open window to improve airflow. Ask the person who’s sick to wear a well-fitted protective face mask when you’re around each other. You should wear one, too. Don’t share items such as electronics, bedding, or dishes. Use gloves when handling the other person’s dishes, laundry, or trash. When you’re done, throw away the gloves and wash your hands. Regularly clean and disinfect common surfaces such as doorknobs, light switches, faucets, and countertops. Take care of yourself. Get enough rest and nutrition . Watch for COVID-19 symptoms. Takeaways Severe COVID-19 symptoms tend to affect older people or those with underlying conditions. But they can develop in anyone, so it's important to take a test if you think you have signs of the virus. If you have serious symptoms, see your doctor right away. To protect yourself and others from COVID-19, get vaccinated and limit contact with those who are infected. COVID-19 Symptoms FAQs What day do severe COVID-19 symptoms start? Symptoms, whether they're mild or severe, usually show up 2-14 days after you're exposed to the virus. When does COVID-19 peak in your body? You'll have the most active illness in your body anywhere from 1 to 2 weeks after symptoms show up. But in very serious cases, this phase could last for months. What are the symptoms of the newest COVID-19? Newer versions of COVID-19, like the Omicron strain EG.5, tend to infect the upper respiratory tract. Common symptoms of the new COVID-19 variants include a runny nose, sore throat , and other symptoms similar to a cold. But people aged 65 and older and those with weak immune systems are more likely to have more serious symptoms affecting their lower respiratory tract."
70,Can I Test Myself for the Coronavirus at Home?,"There are several options for at-home tests that can tell you if you have COVID-19, the illness caused by a coronavirus . They include rapid tests that give you results at home within minutes and home collection kits that are sent to a lab for analysis. They generally cost $10 and up per test ,and can be bought from drugstores and other retailers. Some local health departments also distribute self-tests, often free of charge. Some tests may be covered under insurance , but others aren’t. With self-test kits, you swab yourself and get results in a few minutes, similar to a home pregnancy test. For self-collection kits, you register the test online, take your own swab, and express-ship it to the test company. You get your results either online or by email or text. You could have them as soon as 24 hours after the lab receives your swab, though it may take longer if there's a backlog. What Rapid At-Home COVID-19 Tests Are Available? Most of the self-collection kits are molecular (also called PCR) tests, the most accurate type of COVID-19 test. These can be done either on a nasal swab or a sample of your saliva. The self-test kits that offer quick results are antigen tests, which look for molecules found on the surface of the COVID-19 virus. You take a nasal swab for these tests, which tend to be less expensive than the molecular ones. The FDA warns that these swabs are meant to go in your nose only. If you put them in your throat, you could choke or get an incorrect result. Some self-tests are designed for single use. Others require you take repeat tests within a 2- to 3-day window to confirm your result. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions closely. If you’re not sure about your results, consult your doctor. If you’re unsure which home test to get, ask your pharmacist or doctor. Visit the FDA's website for a complete list of approved COVID-19 home test kits. Some at-home tests that are available include: BinaxNOW. This antigen test can be purchased online or at drugstores. Using their eMEd site or a phone app, you’ll log in. An expert will guide you through how to test yourself with a nasal swab. You get results in about 15 minutes. QuickVue. This is also an over-the-counter antigen test. You get two tests for about $25. After you swab, you put the swab in a solution and wait 10 minutes. You then put a paper strip in the solution. It changes color to indicate positive or negative. On/GO . This antige test can be conducted in just 10 minutes through a mobile app. Cue. This is a molecular COVID-19 test, which means it detects the virus's genetic material. ACON Laboratories Flowflex. The FDA issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for this antigen test in October 2021. If you have possible COVID-19 symptoms and are unable to get a home test, schedule a PCR test with your doctor, pharmacy, or other testing sites. How Does an At-Home COVID-19 Test Work? The COVID-19 at-home or rapid diagnostic tests, also known as COVID-19 lateral flow tests, work similarly to an at-home pregnancy test. Unlike a PCR test, a lateral flow test is designed to analyze different types of bodily fluids in an easy-to-use, disposable kit. Because the tests require little to no training, as long as you follow clear instructions, it can be used outside medical facilities for a quick result or when mass population screening is needed. The result is available typically within 15 to 30 minutes. Unlike a pregnancy test that checks for hormone levels in urine, the COVID-19 lateral flow test will contain specific antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 virus proteins to test samples collected through a nasal or throat swab. Once you collect the sample, the swab is inserted into a tube of liquid. Then, you put the liquid onto a small absorbent pad. Just like a positive pregnancy test, if COVID-19 virus particles are present, a colored line will appear. When to Use a Rapid COVID Test Regardless of whether you're fully vaccinated, consider a self-test if you: Have COVID-19 symptoms like fever, cough, sore throat, and chills Have close contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19. Plan to attend an indoor gathering with people from outside your household, especially if it may include unvaccinated children, older people, or someone who is immunocompromised or otherwise at risk. Take the test right before you go to the event, if possible. Are asked to do so by your employer, college, school, or a health care provider Are At-Home Tests Accurate? With all COVID-19 tests, you could get a false negative or false positive. This means that you could get a negative result and still have the virus, or a positive result and not actually have COVID-19. Bear in mind that false positives are extremely uncommon. To get the most accurate result with your at-home test: Wash your hands for at least 20 seconds before doing it. Disinfect the surface of your testing site before you start. Follow the instructions carefully. Keep your test properly stored, as the directions state until you’re ready to use it. Never use an expired, damaged, discolored, or used test. Don't let your test sit by a heater or in the sun. Without the guidance of a doctor, it can be easy to swab yourself incorrectly, whether orally or nasally. Studies show that self-given tests done without a doctor present were less accurate than those done with a doctor. If you forget to do preparation steps before your test or swab incorrectly, you could cause the virus, if you have it, to go undetected in the test. The accuracy of the self-tests also depends on when you test yourself. According to research, it’s best to do the test within 3-5 days after you've been exposed to someone with the virus. If you have symptoms, test immediately. What Should I Do About My COVID Test Results? If you test positive. If the test comes back positive, the CDC recommends isolation for 5 days. If you have symptoms and they begin to ease (such as no fever for 24 hours), follow this by wearing a mask for 5 days whenever you're around others. Also, notify people you've had close contact with that you've tested positive.  And tell your doctor about your results. If you develop serious symptoms, get medical attention. If you think your result may be incorrect, ask your doctor whether you need more testing or schedule a PCR test. If you test negative. If you have no symptoms and followed the kit directions carefully, you probably don't have COVID-19. There is a small chance you could get a false negative, especially if you tested too early. You may need another test. If you’re unsure, ask your doctor about it. If the result shows an error or is invalid. It’s rare, but this could happen for several reasons, such as: You didn’t follow proper testing instructions. You didn’t collect the sample properly. Your test is defective Check the package instructions again or call the manufacturer for guidance. In the meantime, it’s best to schedule a PCR test for the most accurate results. What Are the Risks of the At-Home COVID Tests? At-home COVID-19 tests can be a helpful option for those who can’t go to a test site. But there are some important things to know about this form of testing. In addition to false positives, false negatives, and testing mistakes, you should be aware of: Testing for variants. While at-home tests seem to be able to find variants of COVID-19 as well, researchers still need more information from test manufacturers to make sure. If your at-home test reads positive, it’s best to let your doctor know and get proper treatment as soon as possible, especially if you have a variant that may make you sicker than the original virus. Proper reporting. Some tests require that you have access to a smartphone or laptop to report your test results. Since it’s up to the user to do so, this can lead to some cases going unreported. It’s important that you let your doctor know if you have a positive test result. Some at-home tests also allow you to send in your results through an app. You should also let your doctor know if you reported a positive test with an app. FAQ About Paying for Home COVID-19 Tests The Biden administration requires private insurers and group health plans to cover certain at-home COVID-19 tests purchased after Jan. 15, 2022. Here are answers to some frequently asked questions about paying for home tests. Q. Is my insurer required to pay for at-home COVID-19 tests? A. If you're insured through an employer, your insurer must pay for eight over-the-counter home tests per month for each person covered under your plan. For example, if you have a family of four and you’re all on the same plan, your family could get up to 32 free tests per month. You can buy the tests all at once or at different times throughout the month. To make sure they're covered by insurance, choose only home tests that are FDA-approved. Here are lists of approved antigen tests and molecular tests . Depending on your health plan, your insurer will either cover the costs up front or require you to file a claim to get reimbursed. Call your insurer to find out which method they use. Q. What do I need to know if my plan pays up front for home tests? A. Some health plans have a network of “preferred” pharmacies, stores, and online retailers where you can get home tests with no out-of-pocket costs. Ask your insurer if your plan works this way. You can buy tests from sellers outside your plan’s network, but your insurer won't pay up front and might not cover the full cost. Instead, they’ll reimburse you up to $12 per test (or pay the full cost of the test if it’s under $12). Hold onto your receipt. You’ll need to include it when you submit your reimbursement claim. Q. What if my plan only covers home tests through a reimbursement program? A. In that case, you must submit a claim to your insurer to get reimbursed for the test. If your plan doesn't have a network of preferred sellers, they'll reimburse you for the full cost for FDA-approved tests. Keep your receipt when you buy a test so you can use it when submitting your reimbursement claim. Call your plan and ask how to send in a claim. You won’t need a prescription or a note from your doctor. Q.  Do Medicaid and CHIP programs cover home tests? A. Yes. Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) must cover at-home COVID tests. Call your state’s Medicaid or CHIP agency to find out the specifics since coverage rules can vary by state. Q. Does Medicare cover at-home tests? A. Starting in early spring 2022, if you have original Medicare (also called Medicare Parts A and B) you will be eligible to get eight FDA-approved at-home COVID-19 tests per month for free. The tests will be available through eligible pharmacies, community health centers, and other Medicare-certified health clinics. Check with your plan for more information. Some Medicare Advantage plans (also called Medicare Part C) may cover and pay for at-home COVID-19 tests. If you have this plan, check to see if it will cover and pay for the at-home COVID-19 tests. It’s important to note that anyone with Part B Medicare coverage is eligible for the new benefit, whether enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan or not. With original Medicare, you’ve still got other free testing options. The program pays for COVID-19 diagnostic tests done by a lab if your doctor, pharmacist, or another authorized health worker orders the test for you. You can also get up to one free lab test a year without an order. Q. Can I get free home tests even if I don’t have insurance? A. Each household in the U.S. can order four free home COVID tests through the federal site COVIDtests.gov . You can get these free tests whether or not you have health insurance. You can also get at-home tests for free at some local health departments or Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHC). What Are Some Other COVID-19 Testing Options? If you don't want to do a test at home, a medical professional may be able to test you depending on your symptoms, risk factors, and whether you’ve been exposed to the virus. Here’s what to do if you think you need to be tested: Call your doctor, clinic, or hospital and let them know you think you may have COVID-19 symptoms. Tell them if you are older than 60 or have another health condition, like diabetes, heart disease, or cancer. Be ready to describe your symptoms and if you think you’ve been exposed to the virus. Your doctor or hospital will tell you what to do next. This could include going to a clinic, going to a drive-through test location, or staying at home and away from other people to avoid spreading the disease."
71,Coronavirus Testing,"If you don't feel well , you may wonder if you have COVID-19. Tests can tell whether you have it now. Antibody testing can show if you had it already. Who Should Get Tested? The CDC has offered the following recommendations for who should consider being tested: People who have symptoms of COVID-19 People who've had close contact with someone who is known or suspected to have COVID (test at least 5 days after the contact) All people traveling internationally must follow their destination's testing requirements before travel. If you know or suspect you have been exposed to someone who has tested positive for COVID-19, you should get tested. Types of Coronavirus Testing The CDC recommends a COVID-19 test called a nasopharyngeal swab for coronavirus. A special 6-inch cotton swab is inserted up each of your nostrils and moved around for about 15 seconds. It won’t hurt, but it might be uncomfortable. The material from inside your nose will show whether you are negative or positive. Home self-testing is available and you can get your results in 15 minutes or less. Depending on the reason behind your testing, you may need official lab results which are done by a medical professional. The results are analyzed by a laboratory. COVID-19 tests include swabs of: Your mouth and throat (oropharyngeal) The middle of your nostrils (nasal mid-turbinate) The front of your nostrils (anterior nares) If you have a cough with mucus, called a “wet” or “productive” cough, your doctor might want to test some of what you can cough up. Testing can take place in medical clinics, hospitals, or private laboratories. Each state has several public health labs that do testing. For information about testing in your state, online at the CDC . “Serology” tests look for antibodies. Your body makes them when you've had an infection. These COVID-19 tests spot two types of antibodies: IgM, which your body makes for about 2 weeks before the levels drop IgG, which your body makes more slowly (within about 4 weeks) but which usually last longer A swab or spit test can tell only if you have the virus in your body at that moment. But a blood test shows whether you've ever been infected with the virus, even if you didn't have symptoms. This is important in researchers' efforts to learn how widespread COVID-19 is. Drive-through coronavirus testing Some hospitals and agencies continue to have centers where you can get a COVID-19 test without getting out of your car. You may need to register online or by phone, or you might need a doctor's order first. Be sure to check before you go. Testing for COVID-19, Flu, and RSV The FDA has approved several at-home tests. They include rapid tests where you get your results at home within minutes as well as home collection kits which are then sent to a lab for analysis. You'll collect your own sample through an at-home nasal swab. Then, you'll send the sample to Labcorp, where they'll do tests. Your results will be available through an online portal. A health care provider will also reach out if you have a positive or invalid test. You can buy the at-home test online or in stores with no prescription. The collection process is slightly different based on your age: Those 18 years and older can collect their own sample. People 14-17 years old must have adult supervision when they're getting a sample. Children 2 years and older must have an adult help them collect a sample. How to Get Tested The FDA has approved several other at-home tests. They include home collection kits which are then sent to a lab for analysis, as well as rapid tests where you get your results at home within minutes. If you have a health care plan, you can get an at-home FDA-authorized COVID-19 test from some pharmacies or stores for free. If your pharmacy or store isn't set up for the free tests, you may have to pay upfront. Make sure you keep your receipt. Your insurance will reimburse you up to $12 per test. If you don't have insurance, you can still get a free test. The government has set up a website to send tests if you request them. You can use this website whether or not you have insurance. You can also get free at-home tests from some community health centers or health clinics. Check the CDC's website . Some of the available rapid tests include: BinaxNOW. The antigen test can be purchased online or at drugstores. You receive results within 15 minutes. Ellume. This antigen costs about $30. It also uses an app to guide you through the process using a nasal swab, and results are known within 15 minutes. QuickVue. Also an over-the-counter antigen test, you get two tests between $18 and $30. After you swab, you put the swab in a solution and wait 10 minutes. You then put a paper strip in the solution. It changes color to indicate positive or negative. Cue. This is a molecular COVID-19 test and should be available without a prescription. Lucira Health's “All-In-One.” Costing between $64-$75, it requires a prescription. You collect a sample through a nasal swab that you put in a vial of solution. You then put the vial into a portable, battery-operated device. Within 30 minutes, a light on the device indicates negative or positive. At-home saliva tests are available where you spit into a vial and mail it to a lab. Free, in-person COVID-19 testing is available in most communities. Some locations require an appointment while others are drive-up. Antibody testing usually requires an appointment. Most locations are listed online, but you can also call your doctor, your local hospital, the health department, or an urgent care center about testing locations near you. If you think it's an emergency, call 911. Whoever you call, you'll need to tell them about your symptoms over the phone or during an online visit. They may ask you some of these questions: Do you have a fever or cough ? Do you have shortness of breath? Have you been in close contact (within 6 feet) with someone who has COVID-19? Has someone with COVID-19 coughed or sneezed on you? Have you traveled recently? Did a health official tell you that you've come in contact with COVID-19? In April 2022, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for a new type of COVID-19 test called the InspectIR COVID-19 Breathalyzer. It looks for signs of the virus in breath samples. A trained expert can give you this test in less than 3 minutes. The test uses something called “gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). With this, it can find chemical mixtures and identify compounds that are related to the virus that causes COVID-19. In studies, experts found that the breathalyzer for COVID-19 accurately found 91.2 percent of all positive cases and correctly picked up on 99.3 percent on all negative cases. You can't get a COVID-19 breath test at home. They're only available in doctor's offices, hospitals, and mobile testing sites. How Long Do Test Results Take? Rapid test results take about 15 minutes. It may take a lab about 24 hours to run your test. But you might not get your results for several days based on possible backlogs in the lab. Future tests might be faster. What Happens After I Get Tested? A positive COVID-19 test means you currently have or recently had the virus. Monitor your symptoms and get medical help right away if you have trouble breathing, confusion, or bluish lips or face. Take steps to avoid spreading the virus: Stay home, except to get medical care. Stay away from other people in your home. Wear a mask when you are around others in the house Don't share dishes, cups, eating utensils, or linens with others. Cover your coughs and sneezes. Wash your hands often. Clean and disinfect common surfaces like phones, doorknobs, or counters regularly. If your test is positive and you have COVID-19 symptoms, you should isolate yourself until you meet all these criteria: It's been at least 5 days since your symptoms began. Your symptoms have improved. You haven't had a fever for at least 24 hours, without using any fever-reducing medication. Keep wearing a mask around others for another 5 days. If you tested positive but didn't have symptoms, isolate yourself for 5 days. If you still have no symptoms, you can leave your house, but keep wearing your mask around others for 5 more days. There usually is no need to be retested if you have been in isolation for 10 to 14 days if your symptoms were mild. If you had a moderate or severe case of COVID-19, you'll need to isolate for longer. If your COVID-19 test is negative, you probably didn't have the virus at the time of the test. But you can still get sick later. Follow distancing guidelines, and wash your hands often. There's a very small chance that your COVID-19 test results could be wrong. This is called a false positive or false negative. Your doctor or health care professional will help you decide what to do based on your symptoms and health history. When Is It an Emergency? If you can't get tested, you may still need medical help. Call your doctor if you don't feel well or have a high fever or a cough. Call 911 if you have: Trouble breathing Pain or pressure in your chest Confusion Trouble staying alert A blue tint to your lips or face"
72,COVID Variants,"What Is a COVID Variant? Viruses are always changing, and that can cause a new variant, or strain, of a virus to form. Changing into a variant usually doesn't affect how the virus works. But sometimes they make it act in different ways. Scientists around the world are tracking changes in the virus that causes COVID-19. Their research is helping experts understand whether certain COVID-19 variants spread faster than others, how they might affect your health, and how different vaccines might work against them. How many variants are there? The number changes often. In late 2023, the World Health Organization listed nine variants as circulating at the time. More than 50 variants have been identified; although some are no longer spreading. COVID variants of concern Experts use a rating system to determine how carefully a variant needs to be watched. A strain will be labeled a variant of concern, or VOC, if, compared to other strains: It spreads faster. It causes more serious symptoms, sending more people to the hospital or causing more deaths . Vaccines and previous COVID infections don't protect nearly as well against it. Treatments and COVID tests don't work as well on it. COVID variants of interest This is a step down from a variant of concern. A strain may be considered a variant of interest, or VOI, if: Vaccines or previous cases of COVID are somewhat less protective against it. It's predicted to spread faster and cause worse symptoms. Treatments and tests work less well on it. It has genetic markers that make scientists worry it will spread fast or be hard to treat or test for. It seems to be causing a lot of cases or an outbreak in a certain area. Newer COVID Variants The COVID virus continues to develop new variants. That's a natural process that happens as viruses spread and reproduce. (Photo Credit: Getty Images) As of October 2023, the World Health Organization didn't list any variants of concern spreading. It did list three variants of interest that were circulating. All are branches of the Omicron strain, which first appeared in Africa in November 2021. It quickly became the dominant strain of the virus in the U.S. An Omicron variant named EG.5, also sometimes called ""Eris,"" is the main version in the U.S. The WHO also was watching six variants to see whether they'd rise to the level of ""variants of interest."" This group is called ""variants under monitoring,"" or VUM. One variant they're monitoring is a strain called BA 2.86, nicknamed ""Pirola."" All of the Omicron variants have spread more easily than earlier versions of the virus. Scientists suspect this linked to the way Omicron has mutated, which has involved lots of changes to the part of the virus that attaches to human cells. How Many Coronaviruses Are There? Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that have been around for a long time. Many of them can cause a variety of illnesses, from a mild cough to severe respiratory illnesses. The coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is one of several known to infect humans. It's probably been around for some time in animals. Sometimes, a virus in animals crosses over into people. That's what scientists think happened here. So this virus isn't new to the world , but it is new to humans. When scientists found out that it was making people sick in 2019, they named it SARS-CoV-2. How Do Variants Happen? Coronaviruses have all their genetic material in something called RNA (ribonucleic acid). RNA has some similarities to DNA, but they aren't the same. When viruses infect you, they attach to your cells, get inside them, and make copies of their RNA, which helps them spread. If there's a copying mistake, the RNA gets changed. Scientists call those changes mutations. These changes happen randomly and by accident. It's a normal part of what happens to viruses as they multiply and spread. Because the changes are random, they may make little to no difference in a person's health. Other times, they may cause disease. For example, one reason you need a flu shot every year is because influenza viruses change from year to year. This year's flu virus probably isn't the exact same one that circulated last year. If a virus has a random change that makes it easier to infect people and it spreads, that variant will become more common. All viruses, including coronaviruses, can change over time, and there have been several variants already that have contributed to the pandemic. What Is the Omicron Variant? The Omicron variant (B.1.1.529) was first detected  on Nov. 11, 2021, in Botswana. Experts in South Africa first reported the Omicron variant to the World Health Organization (WHO) on Nov. 24, 2021. They discovered the variant after COVID-19 infections suddenly began to go up. Omicron has gone through several mutations: Omicron “stealth” variant (BA.2) : Scientists call it Omicron BA.2 as opposed to the original Omicron variant, BA.1. At first, scientists thought BA.2 wasn’t as contagious as BA.1 and would soon fade away. That didn’t happen, and in January 2022, BA.2 appeared to be at least as easy to transmit as BA.1. In early 2022, BA.2 showed signs of spreading more easily than other variants , though it didn’t seem to cause more serious symptoms. Omicron subvariant BA.2.12.1 : In the spring of 2022, it made up almost 43% of COVID-19 infections in the U.S. Omicron variants BA.4 and BA.5. These were first spotted in South Africa. There, they “rapidly replaced” BA.2, according to early research. Past COVID Variants Some COVID variants that developed earlier in the pandemic include: Alpha (B.1.1.7). In late 2020, experts noted gene mutations in COVID-19 cases seen in people in southeastern England. This variant has since been reported in other countries, including the U.S. Scientists estimate that these mutations could make the virus more transmissible, meaning it could spread more easily. Some research has linked this variant to a higher risk of death, but the evidence isn't strong. Beta (B.1.351). This variant was first found in other countries, including South Africa and Nigeria. The Beta variant appears to spread more easily than the original virus but doesn't seem to cause worse illness. Gamma (P.1). In January 2021, experts spotted this COVID-19 variant in people from Brazil who'd traveled to Japan. By the end of that month, it was showing up in the U.S. The Gamma variant appears to be more contagious than earlier strains of the virus . And it may be able to infect people who've already had COVID-19. A report from Brazil confirms that a 29-year-old woman came down with this variant after an earlier coronavirus infection a few months before. Some early research suggested that the variant's changes might help it evade antibodies (made by your immune system after an infection or a vaccine) that fight the coronavirus. A lab study shows that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine can neutralize the fast-spreading Brazil strain. But more research is needed. Delta (B.1.617.2). The highly transmissible COVID-19 delta variant, also known as B1617.2, was found in India in October 2020. It was the dominant strain in the U.S. and several other countries during the fall of 2021, but by March of 2022 accounted for 0 cases in the U.S., having been overtaken by the even more contagious Omicron variant. Research suggests that mutations made the Delta variant up to 50% more transmissible than previous COVID-19 variants. By January 1, 2022, the Delta variant had reached more than 183 countries, overtaking the Alpha variant in the number of cases in many of those countries, including the U.S. Mu (B.1.621). Experts first spotted this COVID-19 variant (pronounced ""myoo"") in Colombia in January 2021. Since then, countries in South America and Europe have reported outbreaks of Mu. In the U.S., the CDC says Mu reached a peak in June 2021, when it made up less than 5% of variants going around the country. R.1. Scientists first detected R.1 in a number of countries, including Japan. There was an outbreak at a Kentucky nursing home in March 2021, when an unvaccinated health care worker passed it to about 45 other staff and residents. Epsilon , Theta , and Zeta were at one point listed as variants of interest and were downgraded by the WHO. They are still being monitored. The First Variants Even earlier in 2020, when the pandemic was new, you might have heard that there was more than one strain of the new coronavirus. Is it true? The answer appears to be yes. The theory about different variants of the new coronavirus came from a study in China. Researchers were studying changes in coronavirus RNA over time to figure out how various coronaviruses are related to each other. They looked at 103 samples of the new coronavirus collected from people, and they looked at coronaviruses from animals. It turned out that the coronaviruses found in humans weren't all the same. There were two types, which the researchers called “L” and “S.” They're very similar, with slight differences in two places. It looks like the S type came first. But the scientists say the L type was more common early in the outbreak. What to Expect The virus that causes COVID-19 will probably keep changing. Experts may find new variants. It's impossible to predict how those virus changes might affect what happens. But change is just what viruses do. NEWSLETTER Stay Up-to-Date on COVID-19 Sign up for the latest coronavirus news. COVID Variant Symptoms The basic symptoms of COVID remain the same: Fever or chills Cough Fatigue Trouble breathing or shortness of breath Body aches Headache Sore throat Loss of taste or smell Congestion or runny nose Diarrhea, nausea or vomiting But sometimes different variants cause subtly different symptoms. For instance, with the Delta variant, a cough became less common and loss of smell was no longer listed in the top 10 common symptoms. Researchers worried that people would mistake symptoms for a bad cold and avoid quarantine, helping the variant spread. Omicron strains, so far, have caused more cold-like symptoms such as runny nose and sore throat Takeaways The virus that causes COVID keeps mutating, producing new variants, or strains. This is a natural process. Most of these changes make no difference to a person's health. But some mutations make a COVID variant spread more easily or cause a more severe form of the disease. COVID Variant FAQs What are the four variants of coronavirus? COVID has developed numerous variants since 2019. Scientists divide those variants into four classes or tiers, based on things like how easily a strain spreads, how sick it might make you, and whether current treatments work. The four tiers, from most worrisome to least, used by the CDC are: Variant of high consequence Variant of concern (VOC) Variant of interest (VOI) Variant being monitored (VBM) How are there different variants of COVID? When a virus infects your body, it begins to reproduce . Sometimes, the copies are imperfect and some small bit of genetic material is changed. That's how new variants are created. What are the types of COVID strains? Among the COVID strains you may have heard of are Delta and Omicron. Delta was the most common in the U.S. in the fall of 2021. In 2023, Omicron was the dominant strain."
73,Coronavirus Antibody Testing,"What Is a COVID-19 Antibody Test? An antibody test is a screening for things called antibodies in your blood. Your body makes these when it fights an infection, such as COVID-19. The same thing happens when you get a vaccine , such as a flu shot . That’s how you build immunity to a virus. Antibody testing uses a blood sample to see if your body has created antibodies to fight the virus that causes COVID-19. (Photo Credit: iStock/Getty Images) The antibody test, also known as a serology test, isn’t checking for the virus itself. Instead, it looks to see whether your immune system -- your body’s defense against illness -- has responded to the infection or vaccination. Can COVID-19 antibody tests show if you have COVID-19? A COVID-19 antibody test shows whether you had the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, which causes COVID-19, at some point in the past. It could be gone, or you could still be contagious. The test can also indicate whether your body created antibodies in response to the COVID-19 vaccine. To diagnose COVID-19, you should take a coronavirus test, sometimes called a diagnostic test. It’s simpler and faster than an antibody test. It tells you if you have the virus active in your body at the moment when you’re tested. COVID-19 Antibodies Antibodies are proteins that fight different infections in your body, and they're part of your overall immune response when you're infected with a disease. Your immune system can also learn to make antibodies through vaccination. If you've recovered from COVID-19 or were vaccinated against it, COVID-19 antibodies will appear in your blood. How long do COVID-19 antibodies stay in your system? Antibody tests can detect COVID-19 antibodies within a few days to weeks after you've been infected or vaccinated against COVID-19. There are two kinds of antibodies for SARS-CoV-2: IgM antibodies, which are produced early in an infection IgG antibodies, which are more likely to show up later Both types of antibodies may be detected around the same time after infection. For the most accurate test, it's recommended that you wait 2-3 weeks after getting COVID-19 or receiving the vaccine so that your body has time to build antibodies that will appear on test results. The protection of these antibodies varies depending on the person, but over time antibodies decrease. IgM antibodies usually become undetectable weeks to months following infection. IgG antibodies are detectable for longer periods, however. Even as COVID-19 antibody protection wanes, your body's cells may remember the COVID-19 virus. Your immune system will react if you're infected again so that you don't get sick as seriously. How Does a COVID-19 Antibody Test Work? To perform a COVID-19 antibody test, a technician will take a bit of your blood , through a finger prick or by drawing blood from a vein in your arm. The test looks for one or both kinds of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, the IgM and IgG antibodies. What is considered a high level of COVID-19 antibodies? It's hard to compare levels of antibodies, as antibody test reports can vary. SARS-CoV-2 antibody test types include: Qualitative: This test only tells you if antibodies are present, so your result is either positive or negative, with no number tied to it. Semi-quantitative: This test measures the antibody level in your blood sample on a scale that applies only to that specific test, so you can't compare it with another test from a different company. Quantitative: These tests offer standardized and numeric results, which can be compared with other quantitative tests that use the same certified reference material. More research is needed to understand what the numbers mean when it comes to your protection from infection. When comparing large populations, you can look at antibody levels in various groups of people. For example, data from the United Kingdom's Office for National Statistics used the following ranges, and anything more than 2,000 nanograms per milliliter (ng/ml) was considered a higher level of concentration in the blood: Less than 179 ng/ml (including those with low or no antibodies against SARS-CoV-2) From 179 ng/ml to less than 800 ng/ml From 800 ng/ml to less than 2,000 ng/ml From 2,000 ng/ml to less than 4,000 ng/ml From 4,000 ng/ml to less than 6,000 ng/ml 6,000 ng/ml and above Discuss your test results with your doctor to understand your antibody level. Keep in mind that m ore research is needed to determine what antibody tests can tell us about a person’s immunity to COVID-19. Why Do We Need COVID-19 Antibody Testing? You could have SARS-CoV-2 and not know it. Not everyone who gets it has symptoms. Once scientists know who has had the virus, they can find out how sick it makes most people. And they can study what happens if people who've had it come into contact with it again. Along with other scientific information, this can help researchers understand who might be immune to the virus. For example, researchers found that people who received a primary COVID-19 vaccine dose or an additional booster dose while pregnant created protective antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in both their own blood and their umbilical cord blood, suggesting that the protective antibodies reached the fetus. Those with a booster dose of the vaccine also had higher levels of antibodies. The hope is that research like this using antibody testing can better inform and protect people at risk for COVID-19 of all ages. Are COVID-19 Antibody Tests Accurate? Companies make their own claims about the accuracy of their antibody tests. Some say it’s up to 100%. Government researchers are studying how well the tests are working, but it’s too early to say for sure. The FDA says it will crack down on any manufacturer that sells a bad test. It’s important to note that some tests can mistake IgM antibodies from other coronaviruses, such as common cold strains, for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. NEWSLETTER Stay Up-to-Date on COVID-19 Sign up for the latest coronavirus news. Who Should Get a COVID-19 Antibody Test? As long as you're not currently experiencing symptoms of illness, most people can get a COVID-19 antibody test if they wish. It can be helpful if: You previously tested positive for a COVID-19 infection and want to know if you have antibodies. You were never diagnosed with COVID-19, but want to know if you have been previously exposed to the virus. You received a COVID-19 vaccine and want to know if you have detectable antibodies. How Can You Get a COVID-19 Antibody Test? The FDA has issued emergency use rulings for several antibody tests so people can get them before they have full FDA approval. You can schedule a test through your doctor or pharmacy, as well as through medical lab testing companies. You must go in person to have a blood sample taken, and then a lab will process your results. The cost for antibody testing varies. Without insurance, a typical lab test for COVID-19 antibodies can range from $70 to $100. COVID-19 antibody test at home In the last few years, some at-home COVID-19 antibody tests have become available for purchase. For an at-home test, you take your own blood sample using a finger prick, and then you mail it to a lab. At-home antibody tests are not as widely available, and some companies are not taking new orders at this time. Other tests are in development. One method would enable you to take your blood sample at home and mix it with a solution to show whether you have antibodies within about 15 minutes, but more work is needed to make this available to the public. What Do the Results Mean for You? Positive COVID-19 antibody test A positive result might mean you have some immunity to the coronavirus . It’s too early to know how strong it is or how long it might last. If you received a COVID-19 vaccine, you'll likely show antibodies, but it's possible they won't be detected. If you didn't get the vaccine and you test positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, it probably means you’ve had the virus. Negative COVID-19 antibody test A negative result means antibodies weren't detected in your blood sample. There are various reasons why : You haven't been infected with SARS-CoV-2 previously. You had a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, but your body hasn't made antibodies yet. Or, your body made antibodies, but the level was too low to be seen on the test used. You were vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine, but the antibody test didn't find the same kind of antibodies your body created in response to your COVID-19 vaccine. What if you get two results from two different tests? Results from two tests may be different due to: Test design: Two antibody tests may find different antibodies and different levels of antibodies. Test performance , including the sensitivity and specificity of each test. Timing: Your results could vary depending on when you took the tests, how long it took your body to develop antibodies after a possible SARS-CoV-2 infection, and whether antibody levels decreased over time. You should always review your test results with your doctor to get the best information. What do sensitivity and specificity mean in COVID-19 antibody testing? A highly sensitive COVID-19 antibody test will identify most people who truly have antibodies. Only a small number of people with antibodies may be missed by the test (false negatives). A highly specific test will identify most people who truly don't have antibodies. It's still possible that a small number of people without antibodies may be identified as having antibodies by the test (false positives). COVID-19 Antibody Test Risks Antibody tests aren't always perfect, and new strains of coronavirus may arise in your area. There could be a few reasons that a test doesn't give you accurate results. False positive result It’s possible to get a “false positive” if you have antibodies but had a different kind of coronavirus, or the test may simply be inaccurate. The risk here is having a false sense of security that you're protected from COVID-19. Continue to take precautions against COVID-19, and be sure to take a diagnostic COVID-19 test if you show symptoms. False negative result When your test doesn't detect antibodies even though you may have antibodies for SARS-CoV-2, this is called a “false negative.” It's possible that you were tested too soon after infection, and your body hadn't had time to make antibodies. If you're unsure about your test results, talk with your doctor to consider whether you should do another round of testing. Takeaways COVID-19 antibody tests offer you a way to know if your immune system has created antibodies to fight the virus that causes COVID-19. You can't assume you're immune to COVID-19 if you have antibodies present in your body, however. More research must be done to understand how COVID-19 antibodies help prevent reinfection. Talk to your doctor about the best ways to protect yourself from COVID-19, including vaccines and boosters that can help build up your body's defenses. COVID-19 Antibody Test FAQs What is a coronavirus antibody test? A coronavirus antibody test is a blood test to see if your body has created antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19. It can show how your body responded to the virus or a COVID-19 vaccine. The test can't tell you if you currently have a COVID-19 infection. How are COVID-19 antibody tests done? COVID-19 antibody tests require a blood sample, collected through a finger prick or by drawing blood from a vein. A lab will then test your blood to determine if antibodies are present. Test results may be available the same day, or they could take a few days. Some tests provide just a positive or negative result, while others can provide specific levels of antibodies present in your blood. Is it good to test positive for COVID-19 antibodies? If you test positive for COVID-19 antibodies, it's good because it means your body's immune system has a way to recognize and fight the virus that causes COVID-19. Antibodies can't guarantee that you won't get sick, so you're not immune to getting COVID-19. Still, antibodies that stay in your blood after an infection or vaccine do offer some support to your body, and research is focused on learning more. How do I know if I have COVID-19 antibodies? You may suspect that you have COVID-19 antibodies if you had COVID-19, were sick and never tested to confirm that you had COVID-19, or if you have received the vaccine. You can find out for sure by taking a COVID-19 antibody test."
74,Autoimmune Blistering Disorders,"What Are Autoimmune Blistering Disorders? Autoimmune blistering disorders (also called autoimmune blistering diseases or autoimmune bullous disorders) are a group of rare skin diseases. They happen when your immune system attacks your skin and mucous membranes -- the lining inside your mouth , nose, and other parts of your body. This causes blisters to form. Researchers have found many types of this disorder. Although there's no cure for them, your doctor can give you treatments to help heal the blisters and prevent complications. Types of Autoimmune Blistering Disorders Autoimmune blistering disorders are broken down into different types. These are some of the main ones: Pemphigus is a group of disorders that cause blisters to form on the skin and inside the mouth , nose, throat, eyes, and genitals. They are soft and can break open easily. Pemphigoid is another group. It has three main types: Bullous pemphigoid usually affects people between the ages of 60 and 80. It causes itchy blisters to form on the arms, thighs, and belly. Mucous membrane pemphigoid affects the lining of the mouth, eyes , nose, throat, and genitals. Pemphigoid gestationis affects women during pregnancy or just after their baby is born. It starts as a bumpy rash on the belly, arms, and legs. Then the bumps turn into blisters. IgA mediated bullous dermatoses are disorders in which the immune system makes a lot of immunoglobulin A (IgA), a type of antibody that fights bacteria, toxins, and viruses. It comes in two types: Dermatitis herpetiformis affects people with celiac disease (who are sensitive to the wheat protein called gluten ). It causes clusters of itchy blisters to appear on the elbows, knees, scalp, and buttocks. Linear IgA disease causes new blisters to form a ring around old ones on the skin. This is sometimes called a “cluster of jewels.” This type affects mucous membranes, too. Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita mostly affects middle-aged and older adults. It makes the skin so fragile that blisters form from minor injuries. Autoimmune Blistering Disorder Symptoms The places on your body where blisters form depends on which disorder you have. Some autoimmune blistering disorders cause blisters to grow on the skin. Other types cause them to form in the mucous membranes that line the mouth, nose, throat, eyes , and genitals. They can be painful or itchy. They can break open and leave a sore. Autoimmune Blistering Disorder Causes When your immune system is working as it should, it attacks bacteria and other invaders before they can make you sick. In autoimmune blistering disorders, your system mistakes healthy cells in your skin and mucous membranes for unwanted intruders. Erythema multiforme minor appears as symmetrical rings of red, raised skin that look like targets. Erythema multiforme can appear anywhere on the body. It is most often caused by the herpes simplex virus but has been associated with fungal infections or reactions to medications. Your immune system makes proteins called antibodies. These attack the substances that hold the outer (epidermis) and inner (dermis) layers of skin together. The damage causes the two layers of skin to separate. Fluid collects between the two and forms blisters. Doctors don't know what causes the immune system to misfire. Some people have genes that make them more likely to get one of these disorders. Then, something actually triggers it, such as: Ultraviolet light from the sun Chemicals used to kill pests Hormones Infection Some medicines can also cause autoimmune blistering disorders. These include: Diuretics and other medicines for high blood pressure Rheumatoid arthritis medications Antipsychotic medicines Antibiotics such as amoxicillin ( Moxatag ), ciprofloxacin (Cetraxal, Ciloxan, Cipro ), and penicillin Usually, the blisters go away once you stop taking the medicine causing them. Autoimmune Blistering Disorder Complications Blisters can cause long-term problems if they form in certain parts of the body or break open. Blisters that pop open can cause infections. After they heal, they can leave scars. In the throat or lungs , they can make it hard to eat, swallow, or breathe . In the mouth, they can cause gum disease and tooth loss. In the eyes , they can affect sight. Autoimmune Blistering Disorder Diagnosis You'll see a dermatologist. They will look at your skin and see where the blisters have formed. You might get one or more of these tests: Blister biopsy . Your doctor removes a piece of the blister and looks at it under a microscope. A biopsy can show where the skin layers have separated. Direct immunofluorescence. A chemical is placed on the skin biopsy sample. Then it is tested for antibodies. The type of antibodies in your skin can show which type of blistering disorder you have. Blood test. Your doctor tests a sample of your blood for antibodies. This test can show how severe your condition is. It can also help the doctor see whether treatment is working. Sometimes it’s hard to tell the difference between autoimmune blistering disorders and other conditions, including: Genetic blistering disease, a group of disorders caused by changes in a gene needed for healthy skin Grover’s disease, a rare skin disorder that can cause small red lesions and blisters Other skin conditions that cause blisters, such as erythema multiforme or impetigo Autoimmune Blistering Disorder Treatment Your doctor will decide on a treatment based on your symptoms. Medicines for these disorders lower the immune system response and prevent it from attacking your skin and mucous membranes. Treatments might include prescriptions from these classes of drugs: Corticosteroids , such as prednisone ( Deltasone , Prednicot, Rayos), that also ease inflammation Immunosuppressive medicines , such as azathioprine ( Azasan , Imuran ), cyclophosphamide , or mycophenolate mofetil (CellCept) Biologic drugs, such as rituximab ( Rituxan ), also used in some cancer treatments For more serious cases, your treatments might include: Intravenous immunoglobulin G ( IVIG ). This is a blood product you get through a needle into a vein. IVIG is an antibody found in plasma -- the liquid part of blood. It's taken from thousands of donors and pooled together. IVIG treatment gives you healthy antibodies to take over for the unhealthy ones that caused your disorder. Plasmapheresis . This treatment removes the harmful antibodies from your blood. The part of blood that's removed is replaced with blood from a donor that contains healthy antibodies. Blisters that pop open can get infected. These drugs help prevent an infection: Antibiotics Antiviral drugs Antifungal drugs Autoimmune Blistering Disorder Home Care To prevent infections and help you stay more comfortable, take care of your blisters. Keep them clean the way your doctor recommends. Try not to pop them. This can leave scars. If a blister is in an uncomfortable place such as your foot , your doctor can release the fluid with a clean needle. Also: Wash your sheets, towels, and clothes often. Make sure everything that touches your skin is clean. Care for your teeth . If you have blisters in your mouth, ask your dentist how to brush your teeth and gums without causing pain and more damage. Each person with autoimmune blistering disorders is different. Some people have only mild blisters that go away on their own. Others have more severe skin problems that are harder to treat. Talk to your doctor about your situation. Try different treatments until you find one that works for you."
75,Hands-Only CPR for Adults,"Call 911 if a person: Collapses Becomes unresponsive 1. Check Responsiveness Tap the person's shoulder and shout, ""Are you OK?"" Look for normal breathing. Call 911 if there is no response. Start Hands-Only CPR. Hands-Only CPR should not be used for adults whose cardiac arrest is due to drug overdose, near-drowning, or an unwitnessed cardiac arrest. In these cases, do a conventional CPR combination of chest compressions and rescue breathing. Note: For hands-only CPR instructions, watch this video from the American Heart Association. 2. Do Chest Compressions Place the heel of your hand on the center of the person's chest. Place the heel of your other hand on top of your first hand, lacing fingers together. Keep arms straight and your shoulders directly over your hands. Push hard and fast, compressing chest at least 2 inches. Let chest rise completely before pushing down again. Compress at least 100 times per minute. 3. Stop Only if: The person starts breathing normally. A trained responder or emergency help takes over. You are too exhausted to continue. There is an automated external defibrillator (AED) to use. 4. Use an AED as Soon as One Is Available Turn on the AED. It will give you step-by-step instructions. Wipe chest dry. Attach the pads. Plug in connector, if needed. Make sure no one is touching the person. Say ""Clear"" so that people know to stay back and not touch the person. Push the ""Analyze"" button if necessary. If a shock is advised, push the ""Shock"" button. Resume compressions and follow AED prompts."
76,What Are Lice? How Do You Know If You Have Them?,"The thought of lice might give you the creepy crawlies -- and with good reason. When these tiny mites infect the scalp and skin , they trigger intense itching and may even create a rash around the hairline. There are different types of lice . The type you have depends on the part of your body that’s affected: Head lice affect the scalp. Pubic lice (also called “crabs”) affect your genital area. Body lice affect other areas of the body and are often found in seams of clothing. View more images This article will focus on head lice, a very common condition among kids in elementary and middle school. About 6 million to 12 million of them get it every year. Head lice are most active at night. They can cause such intense itching that your child could lose sleep over it. It’s uncomfortable, but lice won’t make you sick. They don’t spread disease and they’re not a sign that you’re dirty. You can get lice even if you shower regularly and have super-clean hair . These pesky creatures don’t fly or jump -- they crawl over to the closest head they can find. This is called head-to-head contact, and most people get lice this way. But they also can spread onto hats, helmets, combs, bedding, pillows – even earbuds. Young children may get or spread lice when crawling on rugs. It’s important to know the early signs of lice. Then you can take steps to keep your child comfortable and keep the mites from spreading throughout your home. Identifying Lice These pests are a type of insect called a parasite . They need human blood to live. Head lice usually stay close to the scalp and behind the ears. You might also spot them on the eyebrows and eyelashes. Body Lice. The dark mass in the abdomen of this female body louse is ingested blood, showing she has been feeding on her human host. Body lice are parasitic insects that can rely on their human hosts but can also make their home in clothing or bedding. An infestation can spread rapidly under crowded conditions. Lice are resilient. You may notice the tiny hairs on this louse’s body which help her detect environmental changes that may affect her survival. Female adult lice lay six to eight eggs a day on your scalp, and they spread from there. There are three forms of lice to watch for: Nits, or lice eggs. They’re very tiny -- about half the size of a pinhead. They’re hard to see. The oval-shaped eggs often look yellow or white but may be the same color as your hair . They are found on the first 1-2 inches of hair shaft closest to the scalp (not the end) and are hard to remove. You may confuse them with dandruff or flakes from hairspray build-up. Head lice nits usually hatch in 8 to 9 days. When they do, they leave behind clear shells, which remain stuck to the hair shaft and appear more grey in color. A nymph is a baby louse (singular for lice). It’s what hatches from the nit. It feeds on the blood on your scalp and keeps growing for 9 to 12 days. Nymphs (and adult lice) move quickly and avoid light. Mites begin to appear in your hair, on your skin, and on anything your head has touched. Itching might not start right away. Adult lice are about 2 to 3 millimeters long, about the size of a sesame seed. They’re tan or grayish-white. The color can be lighter or darker. Adult lice have six legs with claws at the end that allow them to latch tightly to your hair. Typically, adult head lice live 30 days when stuck to your head. If they fall off, they die within 1 to 2 days. If you spot lice, tell your child’s school so they can properly clean classroom items and stop the spread. The CDC says lice aren’t a medical hazard, and most health departments don’t require that you report it. But local school boards make their own school lice policies. Check with your child’s school to find out its policy."
77,Polymyalgia Rheumatica and Temporal Arteritis,"Polymyalgia rheumatica is an infrequently occurring, inflammatory condition that causes pain or aching in the large muscle groups, especially around the shoulders and hips. Polymyalgia literally means ""many muscle pains."" Rheumatica means ""changing"" or ""in flux."" What Are the Symptoms of Polymyalgia Rheumatica? Symptoms of polymyalgia rheumatica tend to develop quickly and in addition to muscle pain , other symptoms may include: Stiffness around the shoulders and hips, especially in the morning and after resting Weakness Fatigue Generally feeling ill Mild fevers (occasionally) Weight loss What Is Temporal Arteritis? About 15% of people with polymyalgia rheumatica also have temporal arteritis and about half of people with temporal arteritis also have polymyalgia rheumatica. Temporal arteritis causes inflammation that damages large and medium-sized arteries . The name of the condition stems from the fact that some of the affected arteries provide blood to the head, including the temples. Temporal arteritis is also known as ""giant cell arteritis."" What Are the Symptoms of Temporal Arteritis? Temporal arteritis has several symptoms, including: Severe headaches, the most common symptom Scalp tenderness Jaw or facial soreness, especially with chewing Vision changes or distorted vision that's caused by decreased blood flow to the eye Stroke (rare) Fatigue Fever Weight loss Night sweats Depression Feeling ill Who Gets Polymyalgia Rheumatica and Temporal Arteritis? Polymyalgia rheumatica and temporal arteritis frequently affect people over age 50. The average age of patients is 70. These diseases are more common among women, and Caucasians are more likely to get these diseases than other ethnic groups. The exact cause of these illnesses is unknown. How Are Polymyalgia Rheumatica and Temporal Arteritis Diagnosed? Under the new criteria developed by the American College of Rheumatology and The European League Against Rheumatism, patients ages 50 years and older can be classified as having PMR if they meet the conditions below: Shoulder pain on both sides Morning stiffness that lasts at least 45 minutes High levels of inflammation measured by blood tests Reported new hip pain Absence of swelling in the small joints of the hands and feet, and absence of positive blood tests for rheumatoid arthritis The new classification criteria may also help to evaluate existing treatments for polymyalgia rheumatica. Everyone with polymyalgia rheumatica is typically tested for temporal arteritis. This, too, would start with the exam and listening to the patient's symptoms. If temporal arteritis is suspected, but less convincing features are present, a temporal artery biopsy may confirm the diagnosis. The biopsy is taken from a part of the artery located in the hairline, in front of the ear. In most cases the biopsy is helpful, but in some individuals it may be negative or normal, even though the person does have temporal arteritis. Can Other Problems Mimic Polymyalgia Rheumatica? Yes. Some other illnesses that may be confused with polymyalgia rheumatica include: Rheumatoid arthritis Infections Inflammation of blood vessels (vasculitis) Chemical and hormonal abnormalities A variety of muscle diseases Cancer How Are Polymyalgia Rheumatica and Temporal Arteritis Treated? There is no known cure for polymyalgia rheumatica and temporal arteritis, but these diseases can be treated and controlled. Corticosteroids -- often called "" steroids "" -- help rapidly relieve the symptoms of both conditions. Treatment with steroids -- usually in the form of prednisone -- is mandatory for temporal arteritis to prevent serious complications, such as blindness. Low doses of steroids are often successful in treating polymyalgia rheumatica. Higher doses are often required to treat temporal arteritis. Steroids reduce the function of inflammatory cells that cause these illnesses. Consequently, steroids minimize tissue damage. Steroids also impair the immune system -- thus increasing the risk of infection. The decision to prescribe steroids is always made on an individual basis. Your doctor will consider your age, presence of other illnesses, and medications you are taking. Your doctor also will make sure you understand the potential benefits and risks of steroids before you start taking them. You will have frequent blood tests while taking steroids or other medications to monitor for possible side effects and to evaluate the effectiveness of therapy. These blood tests can usually detect problems before you are aware of any symptoms. Your doctor will frequently evaluate your heart and lung function and blood sugar level, which may increase after you start taking steroids. While being treated for polymyalgia rheumatica or temporal arteritis, it is important to keep all appointments with your doctor and the lab, and have your blood pressure checked regularly. Because the medicines used to treat polymyalgia and temporal arteritis increase your chance for developing infections, report symptoms such as a cough , fever, or shortness of breath to your doctor. Long-term steroid treatment (for a few months to several years) requires additional testing and monitoring. The long-term use of steroids can cause osteoporosis ( bone loss ), which can be detected with scans similar to X-rays. Taking supplements of calcium and vitamin D , sometimes along with prescription medication is recommended to prevent osteoporosis in people taking steroids. Discuss the potential side effects caused by your treatment with your doctor. Temporal arteritis may also be treated with methotrexate or a biologic drug called tocilizumab (Actemra). Tocilizumab is given as an injection under the skin to decrease the amount of steroid a person needs. This medicine may be used along with steroids. Treatments work fairly quickly and have excellent results. What Is the Long-Term Outlook for Polymyalgia Rheumatica and Temporal Arteritis? With careful monitoring and appropriate treatment, most patients with polymyalgia rheumatica or temporal arteritis have a normal life span and lifestyle. Most of the time, these diseases can be successfully controlled with steroids and other drugs (including tocilizumab, a rheumatoid arthritis drug which has been touted for people who have trouble with or do not respond to steroids). The success of treatment is related to prompt diagnosis, aggressive treatment, and careful follow-up to prevent or minimize side effects from the medications."
78,Apert Syndrome,"Apert syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that causes abnormal development of the skull. Babies with Apert syndrome are born with a distorted shape of the head and face. Many children with Apert syndrome also have other birth defects. Apert syndrome has no cure, but surgery can help correct some of the problems that result. Causes of Apert Syndrome Apert syndrome is caused by a rare mutation on a single gene. This mutated gene is normally responsible for guiding bones to join together at the right time during development. In almost all cases, the Apert syndrome gene mutation seems to be random. Only about one in 65,000 babies is born with Apert syndrome. Apert Syndrome Symptoms The defective gene in babies with Apert syndrome allows the skull bones to fuse together prematurely, a process called craniosynostosis. The brain continues to grow inside the abnormal skull, putting pressure on the bones in the skull and face. The abnormal skull and facial growth in Apert syndrome produce its main signs and symptoms: A head that is long, with a high forehead Wide-set, bulging eyes , often with poorly-closing eyelids A sunken middle face Other Apert syndrome symptoms also result from the abnormal skull growth: Poor intellectual development (in some children with Apert syndrome) Obstructive sleep apnea Repeated ear or sinus infections Hearing loss Crowded teeth due to underdevelopment of the jaw Abnormal fusion of the bones of the hands and feet (syndactyly) -- with webbed or mitten-like hands or feet -- are also common Apert syndrome symptoms. Some children with Apert syndrome also have heart , gastrointestinal, or urinary system problems. Apert Syndrome Diagnosis Doctors often suspect Apert syndrome or another craniosynostosis syndrome at birth because of a newborn's appearance. Genetic testing can usually identify Apert syndrome or another cause of abnormal skull formation. Apert Syndrome Treatments Apert syndrome has no known cure. Surgery to correct the abnormal connections between bones is the main treatment for Apert syndrome. In general, surgery for Apert syndrome takes place in three steps: 1. Release of skull bone fusion (craniosynostosis release). A surgeon separates the abnormally fused skull bones and partially rearranges some of them. This surgery is usually performed when a child is between ages 6 and 8 months. 2. Midface advancement. As the child with Apert syndrome grows, the facial bones again become misaligned. A surgeon cuts the bones in the jaw and cheeks and brings them forward into a more normal position. This surgery may be done at any time between ages 4 and 12. Additional corrective surgery may be needed, especially when midface advancement is done at a young age. 3. Correction of wide-set eyes (hypertelorism correction). A surgeon removes a wedge of bone in the skull between the eyes. The surgeon brings the eye sockets closer together, and may adjust the jaw, too. Other Apert syndrome treatments include: Eyedrops during the day, with lubricating eye ointment at night; these drops can prevent the dangerous eye drying that can occur in Apert syndrome. Continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ); a child with Apert syndrome and obstructive sleep apnea may wear a mask at night, attached to a small machine. The machine delivers pressure that keeps the child's airways open during sleep. Antibiotics . Children with Apert syndrome are prone to ear and sinus infections caused by bacteria, requiring antibiotic therapy. Surgical tracheostomy, or placement of a breathing tube in the neck; this surgery may be done for children with severe obstructive sleep apnea due to Apert syndrome. Surgical placement of ear tubes (myringotomy), for children with repeated ear infections due to Apert syndrome Other surgeries may be beneficial for certain children with Apert syndrome, depending on their individual pattern of facial bone formation problems. Apert Syndrome Prognosis Children with Apert syndrome usually require surgery for release of the skull bones to allow a chance for the brain to develop normally. The older a child is before this surgery is performed, the lower the chance for reaching normal intellectual ability. Even with early surgery, certain brain structures may remain poorly developed, however. In general, children who are raised by their parents have a better chance of achieving normal intellectual ability. About four in 10 children with Apert syndrome who are raised in a healthy family environment reach a normal intelligence quotient (IQ). Among Apert syndrome children who are institutionalized, only about one in 18 achieves a normal IQ. In one study, three of 136 children with Apert syndrome eventually attended college. Children with Apert syndrome and other similar conditions who have normal IQs do not seem to have an increased risk of behavioral or emotional problems. However, they may require additional social and emotional support to help cope with their condition. Children with Apert syndrome with lower IQs often do have behavioral and emotional problems. There can be wide variability between children with Apert syndrome, with some severely affected, and others only mildly affected. Experts are unsure why the same gene mutation can result in such variation in a child's Apert syndrome prognosis. Life expectancy also varies between children with Apert syndrome. Those with Apert syndrome who survive past childhood and don't have heart problems likely have a normal or near-normal life expectancy. Life expectancy is likely improving because of advances in surgical techniques and follow-up care."
79,Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease,"What Is Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease? Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease ( CJD ) is a very rare disorder that causes the brain to break down. Also called ""classic"" CJD, it worsens quickly. Most people die within a year of getting it. The disease destroys brain cells. Seen through a microscope, it makes the brain look like a sponge. Classic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is not the same as “ mad cow disease ,"" which only happens in cattle. It's also not linked to ""variant"" CJD, which comes from products made from cattle that had mad cow disease . Causes There are three types of classic CJD. Each has a different cause: Sporadic: This is the most common type. It's caused by harmful proteins in the body called prions. Prion proteins are a normal part of your body. But sometimes they can fold the wrong way as they form. This “misfolded” prion infects the brain and destroys brain cells. Scientists don’t know why this happens. Familial: This happens in people who inherit a bad gene from a parent. Only 10% to 15% of CJD cases each year are familial. Acquired: The rarest form, It happens when someone comes into contact with a medical instrument (like a scalpel), organ (by transplantation), or growth hormone that’s infected with CJD. It makes up less than 1% of classic CJD cases. Symptoms The symptoms start and worsen very quickly. People with CJD often have signs of dementia , including: Confusion Trouble walking Jerky muscle movements or twitching Personality changes Trouble with memory and judgment Vision problems Sometimes people with it have trouble sleeping or become depressed. In later stages of the disease, they often lose the ability to speak or move. They may also get pneumonia or other infections, or slip into a coma . Diagnosis There is no single test for CJD. Doctors diagnose it from your symptoms. One sign of the disease is how fast it gets worse. A few tests doctors can use include: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This brain scan puts together detailed images. Doctors use these images to see changes in the brain over time. Electroencephalogram ( EEG ). This is another type of test using surface electrodes that measures the electrical activity in the brain. Lumbar puncture ( spinal tap ). Doctors use a long, very thin needle to draw some of the fluid out of the spinal column to test for certain proteins. The only way to know for sure someone has CJD is by taking a sample (called a biopsy ) of their brain tissue, or by autopsy. Doctors don’t usually biopsy brain tissue, because it’s risky, both for the patient and the doctor. It’s hard to target which tissue in the brain is infected, so doing a biopsy may not give helpful information. And it puts the doctor at risk of getting the disease. Since a positive diagnosis doesn't help someone with CJD, doctors often confirm cases only after someone dies of it. Treatment There are no treatments for CJD. Researchers have tested several drugs, but none have been able to slow or stop the disease. Doctors can prescribe pain medicine for the symptoms. Muscle relaxers or anti- seizure drugs can help with stiffness. People with CJD need full-time care once the disease is in its late stage."
80,What Is SIDS?,"New parents do everything they can to keep their babies healthy. But sometimes, a baby who seems perfectly fine passes away for no clear reason. When this happens to an infant under the age of 1, doctors refer to it as sudden infant death syndrome , or SIDS. Because it often happens when a baby is asleep, you might also hear it called crib death or cot death. The fact that it’s so hard to predict makes SIDS the leading cause of death for babies younger than 12 months in the U.S. It claims about 1,600 infants every year. What Causes SIDS? Doctors aren’t sure, but they have a few ideas. Some babies have a gene or a change to their genes that causes certain health problems that can lead to SIDS . Other babies are born with problems in the part of their brain that controls breathing , heart rate , blood pressure , temperature, and waking from sleep . Right now, there’s no way to test for these issues. But researchers found some things that, when put together, raise a little one’s risk: A hidden health problem, like brain defects Being in the first 6 months of life Stress from something like a poor sleep position, secondhand smoke , or a respiratory infection Remember, none of these by itself is enough to cause SIDS. Risk Factors for SIDS You can’t predict whether your family will be touched by SIDS, but there are a few things that make it more likely: Age . It’s most common for babies between 2 and 4 months. But it can happen at any time during the first year of life. Sex. It’s more likely to affect boys, but only slightly. Race . It happens most often among African-Americans, Native Americans, and Alaska natives. Doctors aren’t sure why. Birth weight. It’s more likely in preemies, especially those born very small, than full-term babies. Familyhistory . A baby ’s odds are high if a sibling or cousin passed away from SIDS. Mom’s health . It’s more likely to happen to a baby whose mother: Is younger than 20 Doesn’t get good prenatal care Smokes, uses drugs, or drinks alcohol while pregnant or during baby’s first year Can You Prevent SIDS? Yes. There are a few easy things you can do to prevent SIDS and keep your little one safe: Put your baby on their back to sleep . Once they can roll over on their own, it’s safe for them to sleep on their tummy. Until then, remember this phrase: “back to sleep.” It’ll help keep your baby’s odds of having SIDS much lower. Choose a firm, flat surface for their bed . Use tight-fitting sheets. Keep pillows, blankets, and other objects out of their sleep area until they are at least 1. You can swaddle them for warmth, but only until they learn how to roll over. Sleep in the same room, but not in the same bed. Sharing a room with your baby can cut their chances in half. But sleeping in the same bed with them raises their odds. Try not to fall asleep while sitting up and holding your baby. Use a pacifier , vaccinate, and breastfeed if you can. All three lower their risk. Keep them cool while they are asleep. Don’t overdress them when you put them down. Their room should be cool and comfortable. You can use a special wearable blanket (called a sleep sack) that covers their body and leaves their face uncovered. Don’t smoke, drink, or use drugs. It’s bad for your growing baby when you’re pregnant. Using drugs and alcohol might even make you a less alert or careful parent. Breathing in secondhand smoke can also raise the odds of SIDS. Stay healthy during pregnancy . Avoid risky behaviors, eat healthy food, and see your doctor for regular checkups."
81,What Is Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma?,"Adenoid cystic carcinoma is a rare kind of cancer that usually starts in the glands that make saliva . These are under your tongue and on each side of your jaw below the jawbone. But it also can occur in other parts of your mouth and throat or other areas of your body, such as your sweat glands or tear glands. Of the 1.9 million people who get cancer each year in the U.S., about 1,300 of them have adenoid cystic carcinoma. It affects more women than men, and it can happen at any age typically between your teens and your 80s. It tends to grow slowly, so it sometimes can spread to other parts of your body before you notice any symptoms. It can come back in places where it's been treated before or spread to your lungs , liver , or bones, where it's more serious. Doctors don't know what causes adenoid cystic carcinoma. It may be linked to some carcinogens, like pollution or asbestos . Symptoms The first sign may be a lump inside your mouth under your tongue or inside your cheek. These lumps usually grow slowly and don't hurt. You might have some trouble swallowing, or your voice might sound hoarse. This type of cancer can spread along nerves, so you might have some pain or numbness in your face. If you notice any of these symptoms, see your doctor. Diagnosis If your doctor thinks you might have adenoid cystic carcinoma, the first step is often a biopsy . They'll take a small sample of the tumor, either after making a small cut or with a needle. A pathologist, a doctor who specializes in the study of diseases, will study the sample to look for signs of cancer. These kinds of tumors can take different forms. They can be solid or round and hollow like a tube, or cribriform, which means they have holes in them like Swiss cheese. The solid tumors usually grow faster. Your doctor might want to find out the size and location of a tumor or look for signs the cancer has spread. You might have one of these tests: MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): Powerful magnets and radio waves are used to make detailed images. CT scan (computerized tomography): Several X-rays taken from different angles are put together to show more information. PET scan (positron emission tomography): Radiation is used to make 3-dimensional color images. Treatment The usual treatment for adenoid cystic carcinoma is surgery followed by radiation treatments. When you have surgery, your doctor will remove not only the tumor but also some of the healthy tissue around it. They'll look at that tissue to make sure the cancer hasn't spread beyond the tumor. Unlike many other cancers, which can go to other parts of your body through your lymph nodes, adenoid cystic carcinoma spreads along your nerves. Your doctor will look at your nerves to make sure the cancer isn't in the area around them and will try to remove any cancerous tissue without damaging them. Sometimes, part of a nerve may have to be removed to get all the cancer out. That can mean you won't be able to move part of your face or it might droop. Your doctor may try to reconnect the damaged nerve with part of another nerve so you can move the affected area. Other times, part of your windpipe or voice box has to be removed. If your doctor can't take out the entire tumor without hurting important organs, or if they're worried the cancer has spread somewhere they haven't seen, you may have radiation treatments. There are three main kinds: External beam radiation focuses high-energy X-rays or protons on cancer cells to destroy them. Your doctor will try to do as little damage as possible to the surrounding parts of your body. Internal radiation therapy is also known as brachytherapy. Your doctor will put small radioactive ""seeds"" at or near the tumor. This is often used when cancer has spread to the lungs . The radioactivity of the seeds lessens after a few weeks. Neutron therapy can target small tumors by heating up the cells with 100 times more energy than regular radiation treatment. That often kills cancer cells while letting the normal cells around them recover. Radiation therapy focused on your head and neck has side effects that can include dry mouth , difficulty swallowing, or soreness around the area that's being treated. It can also damage your teeth . Check with your doctor about these side effects and ask what they can do to help you with them. What to Expect It can be hard to get rid of the cancer entirely. Tumors may come back years later, either in the same place or, more likely, somewhere else -- usually in your lungs. Almost 90% of people who have adenoid cystic carcinoma live at least 5 years after their diagnosis. After your treatment, you'll need regular checkups to look for signs of new tumors. This can involve X-rays, CT scans, or MRIs, depending on your diagnosis."
82, Strabismus (Crossed Eyes),"When you have strabismus, or crossed eyes, your eyes point in different directions. It might happen sometimes or all the time. While one eye looks forward, the other eye may look inward, outward, up, or down. That means the eyes don't work together to look at objects, causing problems such as blurred or double vision. In some cases, it leads to poorly developed vision in one eye, called amblyopia, or lazy eye. The condition is most common in children, but if it goes untreated, it can linger into adulthood. Adults with certain medical conditions also can develop strabismus. It affects about 4% of people in the United States. When one eye turns inward, that's a type of strabismus. It's most common in young children. (Photo Credit: E+/Getty Images) Strabismus Types Doctors describe strabismus by the way it looks or by other features. Types of strabismus based on appearance include : Esotropia: when the eye turns inward Exotropia: when the eye turns outward Hypertropia: when the eye points upward Hypotropia: when the eye points downward Other ways to descript strabismus include: Intermittent or transient: when it only happens sometimes Constant: when it happens all the time Unilateral: when it's always in the same eye Alternating: when it happens in one eye sometimes and the other eye at other times Doctors may also use more specific terms to describe some common types of strabismus. These include: Accommodative esotropia: This happens to people, usually young children, who are farsighted, meaning they see distant objects better than close ones. If the farsightedness isn't corrected, they may work so hard to focus that one or both eyes may turn inward. Intermittent exotropia : In this type, one eye sometimes drifts outward while the other stays focused. The eyes may trade off positions or the same eye may wander every time. Infantile esotropia: This happens in infants, before age 6 months, without farsightedness. One or both eyes can turn inward. Strabismus Causes Strabismus can be caused by problems with the eye muscles, the nerves that send information to the muscles, or the part of the brain that controls eye movement. The cause isn't always clear. You are more likely to develop it if you have: A family history of strabismus. About 30% of children with strabismus have an affected family member, suggesting the condition can be inherited. Farsightedness or nearsightedness. Struggling to focus increases the risk. Certain medical conditions . Premature birth, Down syndrome, cerebral palsy, hydrocephalus (buildup of fluid in cavities deep within the brain), and other neurological conditions increase the risks. You also can develop strabismus at any age as a result of a stroke, brain tumor, or head injury. Some adults with a thyroid condition called Graves' disease also develop strabismus. Strabismus Symptoms Since strabismus most often starts in children under age 3, including some too young to talk, parents and others may be the first to notice signs such as: Eyes that look out of line Eyes that don't move together Frequent blinking or squinting, especially in bright sunlight Tilting the head to look at things Closing one eye to look at things Other symptoms of strabismus can include: Double vision Headaches Trouble reading Eye strain Important to know: it's normal for babies to have wandering eyes from time to time. But by age 3-4 months, their eyes should be straight, well-aligned, and able to focus on small objects. By age 6 months, they should be able to focus on objects that are close and far away. If an adult or an older child suddenly develops double vision or other signs of strabismus, you should call a doctor right away. It's important to find the underlying cause. Pseudostrabismus Sometimes, babies with certain facial features look like they have crossed eyes when they really don't. That's called pseudostrabismus. The confusion is most likely when a baby has some extra skin covering the inner corners of the eyes or a flat nose bridge. As the face develops and grows, the baby's eyes will stop looking crossed. Strabismus Tests Sometimes possible strabismus is picked up during a child's regular checkups, when health care providers may use a screening test called a corneal light reflex test (Hirschberg test). In this test, the child looks at a colorful object while a bright light is shined in the eyes. The health care provider can see if reflections are the same in each eye. An eye doctor, called an ophthalmologist, can confirm a diagnosis of strabismus. Some specialize in diagnosing and treating children. The doctor will start by getting a medical history to find out when symptoms started and what other conditions you or your child might have. Often, the doctor can see that you have strabismus by looking at you. They might also perform a simple test in which you look at an object while covering and then uncovering each eye, to see how and when the abnormal turning happens. Additional tests could include: Visual acuity: This is a test of how sharp or clear your vision is. In the most common version, you read letters from a chart. Eye doctors have different ways of testing visual acuity with young children and others who can't read or understand the eye chart test. Refraction: Checking the eyes with a series of lenses. This is the test used to determine eyeglass prescriptions. Alignment and focus tests: These look at how well your eyes focus, move, and work together. Dilating the pupils: Using eye drops, the doctor may widen the pupils to better see inside the eyes and looks for signs of disease. Sometimes, doctors order additional tests to understand the underlying causes of strabismus. These might include blood tests and MRI scans of the eye sockets. Strabismus Treatment It's important to start treating strabismus as soon as you can. That can prevent long-term problems, including poor vision in children that lasts into adulthood. But it's also never too late to treat strabismus, even if you're an adult who's had it since childhood. Treatment options depend on the underlying cause, the severity, and the person's age. They include: Glasses or contact lenses If strabismus is caused by struggling to focus on objects near or far, regular glasses or contact lenses can sometimes solve the problem. Prism lenses If strabismus is causing double vision, special lenses called prisms might help. The lenses bend the light entering your eye to better line up the images you see. But these special glasses can have bothersome side effects, such as creating colored fringes around objects. Patching If a child has a so-called lazy eye (amblyopia), meaning weak vision in a frequently misturned eye, doctors sometimes recommend wearing a patch over the better eye. That can help the weaker eye become stronger over time. Medications As an alternative to a patch, the doctor might prescribe eye drops to cause blurry vision in the better eye until the weaker eye gets stronger. Some other medications may also be tried. Botox Injections of botulinum toxin (Botox) can temporarily ease eye turning by stopping muscles around the eye from working. One risk is that it can cause a droopy eyelid. Strabismus Surgery If other treatments don't work, you might get surgery for strabismus. This is mostly an option for children, but adults have it sometimes, too. In the surgery, usually done under general anesthesia, your doctor makes cuts in the clear membrane over the whites of your eyes. The surgeon then tightens or loosens eye muscles to help the eyes line up better. You might have surgery on one or both eyes. After moving the muscles, the surgeon will use dissolvable stitches to close the cuts. In some cases, the surgeon will leave adjustable stitches attached to the muscles. These muscles can then be tightened or loosened some more shortly after the surgery, if needed. But this option is usually reserved for adults and teens, since the adjustments are done when you're awake and children might not cooperate. You might get eye drops or ointment to put on the eyes at home. The eyes can take 3 to 12 weeks to heal. The surgery sometimes improves appearance without improving vision. And sometimes the eye wandering comes back, despite the surgery. You also face the risks of any surgery, like infection and bleeding. Strabismus Eye Exercises In addition to any other treatments, your eye doctor might recommend you see a specialist for eye exercises, also known as vision therapy. These activities are designed to improve eye coordination and focus and to help your brain and eyes work better together. You usually see a therapist called an orthoptist or an optometrist, an eye professional who is not a medical doctor. You might do some of the exercises in the therapist's office with special lenses, prisms, and computer programs, and some at home, as instructed by the therapist. These might include: Pencil push-ups To do this, you hold a pencil at arm’s length from your face, then slowly move it closer to your nose, following it with your eyes and keeping it in focus. When you start to see two pencils, you move the pencil further away again. You might repeat this several times a day. This treatment alone has not been proven to help strabismus. Brock string This exercise uses colored beads spaced apart on a 5-foot string tied to a stable object like a chair and stretched to your nose. You focus on the bead closest to your nose and then those farther away. Barrel cards You draw three red barrels, small, medium and large, on one side of a card and three green ones, also small, medium and large, on the other. The barrels should line up lengthwise. You hold the edge of the card against your nose, so you see the red and green sides, with the small barrels closest and the large ones farthest away You stare at the large barrels until they become one image, then repeat with the smaller ones. Strabismus Complications If strabismus goes untreated,  it can cause additional, lasting problems, including: Amblyopia (lazy eye). This happens when the brain constantly gets separate images from the two eyes. To avoid double vision, the brain starts ignoring the image from the wandering eye. In a child, that means normal vision doesn't develop in that eye and it gets weaker. Double vision. This is common in adults who develop strabismus because their brains can't ignore images from the wandering eye. Blurry vision . This gets in the way of school, work, and other activities. Poor three-dimensional (3D) vision. This makes it harder to see how far or near something is. Eye strain Fatigue Headaches Low self-esteem and embarrassment about how your eyes look Ignoring strabismus can also mean ignoring the underlying cause. In adults and older children with sudden strabismus symptoms, it could be something serious, like a stroke or a brain tumor. Takeaways When your eyes point in different directions, it isn't just a cosmetic problem. Strabismus can seriously harm vision in a developing child and cause problems ranging from blurry vision to embarrassment in people of any age. If you think you or your child might have strabismus, talk to your doctor. Strabismus FAQs Can glasses fix strabismus in adults? Eyeglasses fitted with special prism lens can help clear up the double vision that many adults with strabismus have. However, if the glasses don't work or are too heavy or uncomfortable (a common complaint), surgery may be an option. Is strabismus a visual disability? Strabismus may be considered a visual disability or impairment (by schools, for example) if the vision problems it causes can't be corrected by glasses or other measures."
83,What Is Gianotti-Crosti Syndrome?,"Gianotti-Crosti syndrome is a rash that usually affects young children. It's sometimes called papular acrodermatitis of childhood. The rash covers the arms, legs, and face. It can cause itching and discomfort. Gianotti-Crosti is usually a delayed immune reaction to a virus. The rash will appear as your child is recovering from an illness such as a respiratory infection or stomach virus. It's very common and doesn't have lasting effects, but it can be alarming when it appears on your child's skin. What Is the Cause of Gianotti-Crosti Syndrome? Gianotti-Crosti syndrome is a childhood skin condition that caused an itchy, blistering rash. It typically begins on the buttocks and spreads, often to the face and extremities. It's sometimes referred to as papular acrodermatitis of childhood. GCS usually appears while your child is recovering from a viral infection like a respiratory illness or stomach virus. While the blisters can be alarming and the child can have fever and discomfort, there are no lasting effects. Viral illnesses trigger Gianotti-Crosti syndrome. The rash will typically begin as your child is recovering from another illness. Some children also get it after receiving live-virus vaccinations, such as the shots for poliovirus, hepatitis A, diphtheria, smallpox, pertussis, and influenza. It's most common in children under the age of 9 years old, and children with underlying skin conditions like atopic dermatitis are also more likely to develop Gianotti-Crosti. Adults can get it, too, with women being more susceptible to it than men. The condition is most prevalent in spring and summer. Doctors aren't sure why some viruses lead to a Gianotti-Crosti response. There is a broad assumption that it's part of the immune response to viruses, but experts don't know exactly why some people get it while others don't‌. The most common triggers for Gianotti-Crosti in the United States include: Coxsackievirus (hand, foot, and mouth disease) Epstein-Barr virus (infectious mononucleosis) Cytomegalovirus (CVM) Enterovirus infections (often seen as respiratory infections) ECHO viruses (often seen as gastrointestinal illness or viral meningitis ) Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) In regions other than the United States, hepatitis B is a common trigger for Gianotti-Crosti syndrome. In the United States, children are usually vaccinated against hepatitis B. If your child has not been vaccinated for hepatitis B, you may need to have them tested if symptoms manifest. What Are the Symptoms of Gianotti-Crosti Syndrome? A Gianotti-Costi rash looks like an outbreak of raised blisters that appear on your child's skin. The rash often first appears on or near the buttocks, then spreads to the arms, legs, and face. The blisters vary in size and may be filled with fluid. They may be pink, red, or brown in color. The blisters may become itchy or uncomfortable. Your child may also have swollen lymph nodes and a mild fever along with the rash. Children may also experience swelling of the liver or spleen, but you would need a doctor to confirm those symptoms. The rash usually lasts about four weeks, though it can linger as long as eight weeks. It will go away on its own. The rash doesn't typically cause scarring on the skin. There may be dark spots that remain on the skin, but they generally fade after six months. Any other symptoms will also clear up over time. How Is Gianotti-Crosti Syndrome Diagnosed? Tests are not needed to diagnose Gianotti-Crosti syndrome. Your child's doctor will do a physical exam and ask questions about how long the rash has been present. Your doctor will also ask about any illnesses your child may have had in the weeks before the rash appeared. They might check their vaccination records to see if a recent inoculation could be the cause of the rash. If there is cause to worry about a serious viral infection such as hepatitis or HIV, they may test for that. What Is the Treatment for Gianotti-Crosti Syndrome? The main symptom -- the rash -- will go away on its own. But if it’s itchy, you can use over-the-counter anti-itch treatments to ease the symptoms. Your doctor may suggest oral antihistamines if topical treatments don't help. Cool compresses may also reduce itching. If your child has a fever, ask your doctor about using a fever reducer such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Ask about appropriate dosing for your child's age. Make sure your child drinks plenty of fluids, since fevers can be dehydrating. Gianotti-Crosti syndrome is not contagious, so you don't need to isolate your child while they have the rash. In fact, the rash usually appears after the child has stopped being contagious with the virus that triggered the syndrome. Your child can participate in activities while the rash is still present, though you may need a note from your doctor to explain the situation."
84,What Is Croup? What Causes It?,"Croup is a condition that irritates your baby’s upper airways and causes them to swell. As the airway below their vocal cords becomes narrow, your child will find it hard to breathe. Their breathing will be noisy and they’ll have a cough that sounds a lot like a high-pitched seal or dog bark. Their voice will also sound raspy and hoarse, especially when they cry. Most often, croup is caused by an infection. There are two types of this condition -- viral and spasmodic. It’s also called laryngotracheobronchitis. Croup Causes and Risk Factors Croup is more common in the fall and early winter. It’s more common in boys than in girls. Babies and children between 3 months and 5 years of age are most at risk. The condition is contagious, especially in the first few days or until your child’s fever is gone. Viral croup is caused by any virus that infects the voice box (also called the larynx) and windpipe (the trachea ). The virus that most often causes croup is parainfluenza. The symptoms are mild at first but get worse. Spasmodic croup is rare. It comes on suddenly, often in the middle of the night. Doctors believe it may be caused by an allergy or reflux from the stomach . That happens when contents from your baby’s stomach move back up into their esophagus . Other things can also cause a cough that sounds like croup. Your child may have breathed in something with fine particles, like powder or flour. A food allergy can cause their throat to swell closed. If you suspect a food allergy, call 911 right away. Other infections, including epiglottitis or bacterial tracheitis, have similar symptoms. Croup Symptoms Croup might start out like a cold . But over time, your child will develop a “barky” cough. They also may make a high-pitched, wheezing sound in their lower airway when they breathe in. The croup sound in the upper airway is a harsh, loud sound known as “stridor.” There can be a low fever too. Symptoms tend to be worse at night. Your baby might also have redness around their eyes , swollen lymph nodes , or a rash . Any time your child has trouble breathing , retractions (when their skin pulls tight around their ribs), or stridor at rest, immediately call your doctor or 911. Stridor when crying, agitated, or playing, or a barky cough is not an emergency. But if you have any concerns, go ahead and call your baby’s doctor. Croup Diagnosis A doctor can usually diagnose croup by examining your child and listening to their symptoms. But they may need tests to rule out other causes. Your child’s doctor may: Listen to their breathing Look inside their throat Ask about any recent illnesses or breathing problems Take an X-ray to check for something stuck in their throat Test their blood oxygen level Croup Treatment Most of the time, cases of croup are mild and can be treated at home. Try to soothe your child and keep them calm. Crying can make the coughing worse. Hold them upright. Make sure your child has plenty to drink. Try over-the-counter medicines like acetaminophen and ibuprofen to treat a fever. It might make them feel better to breathe steam or cool mist. Call the doctor if your child: Looks sick Has trouble breathing Isn’t speaking or drinking Has noisy breathing even when not agitated If they have to see the doctor, they may get a breathing treatment or a dose of steroids to bring down swelling in their throat and keep their airway open."
85,What's the Treatment for Croup?,"Croup can be uncomfortable and unsettling for your little one. The cough and other symptoms can range from mild to severe. Most mild cases of this condition can actually be treated at home. Here are four ways to make your baby more comfortable if they have croup. Keep them calm . Croup causes your little one’s airways to get inflamed and narrow. This can make it hard for them to breathe . But the more they cry and the more worked-up they get, the worse their symptoms will become. Try to keep your baby as calm as possible. Sing to them, cuddle with them, and read them stories. Moisten the air. Use a cool-mist humidifier to moisten dry air. If you don’t have a humidifier, run a hot shower in your bathroom. Once the air is nice and steamy, sit in the bathroom with your baby for 10 minutes. It may help quell their cough . If it’s cool outside, open a door or window for a few minutes. Fresh, cool air may calm their symptoms, too. You might even take your baby for a car ride with the windows rolled down. Give them fluids . It’s important to keep your baby hydrated if they have croup. Warm, clear fluids can help loosen mucus and take pressure off their vocal cords. If they’re very young or really cranky, give them small amounts of fluid using a spoon or medicine dropper. Keep their head elevated . Prop up your little one’s head with an extra pillow when they turn in at night. But don’t use pillows with babies under 12 months of age. You might also consider sleeping in the same room with your child so you can know right away if they start having breathing problems . If you take your child to the doctor or emergency department, they may be given mist treatment and a single dose of a glucocorticoid medication such as dexamethasone or prednisolone, which are usually given as an oral syrup. The medication reduces inflammation. When to Call the Doctor If your child’s symptoms last more than 3 to 5 days or get worse, don’t try to treat them at home. Get medical help right away if your child: Makes a noisy, high-pitched sound when they breathe in (doctors call this “stridor”) Starts drooling or has trouble swallowing Is constantly cranky, irritable, or uncomfortable Has very hard, labored breathing Has neck or chest muscles that “pull in” when they breathe Is very tired , sleepy, or hard to awaken Turns bluish or dark around their lips, under their nose, mouth , or around their fingernails Is dehydrated with few wet diapers"
86,Meningitis,"What Is Meningitis? Meningitis is a rare infection that affects the delicate membranes -- called meninges -- that cover the brain and spinal cord. You or your children can catch it. Meningitis vs. encephalitis These two conditions are similar, and many symptoms overlap. While meningitis affects the covering of the brain and spinal cord, encephalitis affects the tissue of the brain itself. Types of Meningitis Bacterial meningitis This is an extremely serious illness. You or your child will need to get medical help right away. It can be life-threatening or lead to brain damage unless you get quick treatment. Several kinds of bacteria can cause bacterial meningitis. The most common ones in the U.S. are: Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) Neisseria meningitidis (meningococcus) Listeria monocytogenes (in older people, pregnant women, or those with immune system problems) A bacteria called Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) was a common cause of meningitis in babies and young children until the Hib vaccine became available for infants. There are also vaccines for Neisseria meningitidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Experts recommend that all children get them, as well as all adults who are at a higher risk for the disease. In many cases, bacterial meningitis starts when bacteria get into your bloodstream from your sinuses , ears , or throat. The bacteria travel through your bloodstream to your brain. The bacteria that cause meningitis can spread when people who are infected cough or sneeze . If you or your child has been around someone who has bacterial meningitis, ask your doctor what steps you should take to avoid catching it. Viral meningitis Viral meningitis is more common than the bacterial form and generally less serious, but this isn't always the case. Several viruses can trigger the disease. Among them are: Non-polio enteroviruses, including the one that causes hand, foot, and mouth disease Herpes simplex virus Varicella zoster, which also causes chickenpox and shingles Mumps virus Measles virus Arboviruses such as West Nile and Zika Epstein-Barr, which also causes mononucleosis HIV Flu viruses Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus Fungal meningitis Fungal meningitis is much less common than the bacterial or viral forms. Healthy people rarely get it. You’re more likely to get this form of meningitis if you have a problem with your immune system, such as AIDS . Among the fungi that cause it are: Cryptococcus , which is common everywhere in the world. Histoplasma, which is especially common in soil with lots of bird or bat poop. In the U.S., it's found mostly in eastern and central states. Blastomyces, which thrives in wet soil and decaying leaves. In the U.S., it's found mostly in midwestern, south-central, and southeastern states. Coccidioides, which is found in the soil in the southwestern U.S., Mexico, Central and South America, and some parts of Washington state. Parasitic meningitis Parasitic meningitis is also rare. It’s caused by parasites that usually affect animals. You can get it from eating animals such as snails, slugs, snakes, fish , or poultry that are infected by parasites or their eggs, or produce that contains parasite eggs. The risk is higher with raw or undercooked foods. You can’t pass on this type of meningitis to other people. One especially rare type of this is called eosinophilic meningitis, and it's linked to three specific parasites: Angiostrongylus cantonensis , also known as rat lungworm, is found in Southeast Asia, Pacific islands, the Caribbean, and Africa. Baylisascaris procyonis is a type of roundworm that affects raccoons. It can also infect other small animals, including dogs. Gnathostoma spinigerum is a parasitic worm found mostly in Asia, South and Central America, and some parts of Africa. Amoebic meningitis Amoebic meningitis is a rare but usually fatal infection by a single-celled bug called Naegleria fowleri . This amoeba lives in soil or warm, fresh water, but not salt water. People typically get it from swimming in water where the amoeba lives, not by drinking it. Amoebic meningitis isn’t contagious. Noninfectious meningitis Noninfectious meningitis is caused by diseases such as lupus or cancer , or it may happen if you’ve had a head injury , brain surgery, or take certain medications . It isn’t contagious. Chronic meningitis Chronic meningitis has similar symptoms as acute meningitis but develops over a couple of weeks. It results from infections with a fungus or the mycobacteria that cause tuberculosis . These organisms get into the tissue and fluid surrounding your brain to cause meningitis. Aseptic meningitis is a term doctors use when they can't find signs of bacteria in fluid from your brain and spine. That might mean your meningitis has another cause, such as a virus, or it might mean the bacteria making you sick is hard to grow in lab conditions. Meningitis Symptoms Meningitis can cause a rash that starts small and looks like pinpricks before spreading into red or purple splotches. It can be hard to spot if your skin tone is darker – check the palms of your hands and the soles of your feet. (Photo Credit: John Radcliffe Hospital/Science Source) Meningitis symptoms can develop within hours or days. The condition may look different in adults than it does in babies or children. Signs to watch for include: Confusion Fever Headache Numbness in your face Sensitivity to light Stiff neck so that you can’t lower your chin to your chest Upset stomach or vomiting Severe headache with nausea or vomiting A hard time concentrating Seizures Sleepiness or a hard time waking up Lack of appetite Lack of thirst What's the first sign of meningitis? In the early stages of meningitis, you might feel like you have the flu. Meningitis in babies In infants, meningitis symptoms may include: High fever Crying that’s constant and gets louder when you hold the baby Baby seems overly sleepy, sluggish, or inactive Stiff neck or body Bulge on the soft area on the top of the baby ’s head Poor ability to feed Crankiness Meningitis in children The symptoms of meningitis in children older than 2 are the same as they are in adults. Meningitis rash Meningococcal bacteria is the main cause of the signature meningitis rash. As the bacteria spread through your body, they damage blood vessels. The vessels start to leak blood, which pools into surrounding tissue and becomes visible on your skin. It may start as what's called a ""petechial"" rash, which looks like small, red pinpricks on your skin. You may find them in spots where clothes put pressure on the skin – the waistband, for instance. A ""purpuric"" rash looks like splotches of red or purple, more like bruising. A petechial rash can progress to this stage. It can be tough to spot the rash on darker skin. Check paler areas of the body, such as the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, tummy, roof of the mouth, and insides of eyelids. If you roll a clear drinking glass over the rash, it might disappear. If it does, it's a ""blanching"" rash. If it doesn't go away, it's a ""non-blanching"" rash. A meningitis rash may start as blanching but almost always will progress to non-blanching. You can have meningitis without developing the rash. But the rash is a sign of serious illness, and anyone with it needs immediate medical help. Risk Factors for Meningitis Anyone can get meningitis, but research shows that it's more common in these age groups: Children under 5 Teenagers and young adults aged 16-25 Adults older than 55 Meningitis is more of a danger for people with certain medical conditions, such as a damaged or missing spleen , long-term disease, or immune system disorders . Because certain germs that cause meningitis can spread easily, outbreaks are most likely to happen in places where people live close to each other. College students in dorms or military recruits in barracks can be more likely to catch the disease. So are people who travel to areas where meningitis is more common, such as parts of Africa. Meningitis and Pregnancy One type of germ that causes bacterial meningitis is listeria. If you're pregnant, you're 13 times more susceptible than the general population to infection by this bacteria. It can contaminate: Hot dogs Lunch meat Paté and other meat spreads Smoked seafood Unwashed raw fruits and vegetables Unpasteurized milk Unpasteurized soft cheeses, including f eta, queso blanco, queso fresco, Brie, queso panela, Camembert, and blue-veined cheeses A listeria infection can lead to meningitis. During pregnancy, it can cause early labor or may be fatal to your baby. That's why doctors recommend avoiding foods most often affected by listeria when you're pregnant. Meningitis Causes Meningitis almost always results from a bacterial or viral infection that begins somewhere else in your body, such as your ears , sinuses , or throat. Less common causes of meningitis include: Autoimmune disorders Cancer medications Syphilis Tuberculosis Is meningitis contagious? Meningitis isn't contagious. But some of the things that cause it are. Many things that cause bacterial and viral meningitis can be spread to other people. Meningitis Diagnosis Your doctor will ask about your medical history and do a physical exam , including checking your neck for stiffness and looking for a skin rash that might suggest a bacterial infection. Meningitis tests If your doctor suspects meningitis, you'll need tests to confirm the diagnosis. They might include: Blood tests to find bacteria CT or MRI scans of your head to find swelling or inflammation Spinal tap, in which a health care worker uses a needle to take fluid from around your spinal cord. It can tell what’s causing your meningitis. Treatment for Meningitis Your treatment will depend on the type of meningitis you have. Bacterial meningitis needs treatment with antibiotics right away. The doctor might give you a general or broad-spectrum antibiotic even before they’ve found the exact bacteria that caused your illness. Once they do, they’ll change to a drug that targets the specific bacteria they find with the spinal tap. You might also get corticosteroids to ease inflammation . Viral meningitis usually goes away on its own without treatment. Your doctor might tell you to stay in bed, drink plenty of fluids, and take over-the-counter pain medicines if you have a fever or aches. If a virus such as herpes or influenza caused your illness, you might take antiviral medication. Antifungal medications can treat fungal meningitis. You might need to spend time in the hospital if you're dehydrated or have severe symptoms. Complications of Meningitis Meningitis can cause severe complications in adults and children, especially if you delay treatment. Possible complications include: Seizures Brain damage or stroke Loss of hearing Memory problems Learning problems A hard time walking, or paralysis Kidney failure Shock Death Prevention of Meningitis You may be able to prevent meningitis by avoiding infection with the viruses or bacteria that cause it. These infections are passed to others when you cough, sneeze , kiss, or share toothbrushes , or eating utensils. Take these steps to prevent infections: Wash your hands often. Rinse well. Also, teach your kids to wash their hands often, especially after eating, using the toilet, or when they’re in public places. Don’t share items such as toothbrushes, eating utensils, or lipstick. Don’t share food items or drinks with other people. Cover your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze. Stay healthy. Eat a healthy diet , get plenty of exercise, and rest at night. If you’re pregnant, eat well-cooked food. Avoid foods made from unpasteurized milk and raw or undercooked meats, fish, and eggs. Get immunized. Follow your doctor’s advice on getting immunization shots for diseases that may cause meningitis, including flu and pneumonia vaccines. Meningitis Vaccines Some vaccines can help protect you from meningococcal illness, which is caused by bacteria. MenACWY vaccine, which the CDC recommends for all teens and preteens. One dose is given at the age of 11 or 12, followed by a booster at age 16. It's also recommended for adults at high risk. MenB vaccine is recommended for children 10 and older who are at increased risk MenABCWY vaccine is a combination of MenACWY and MenB. If you're planning to get the other two at the same time, you can get this vaccine instead. The pneumococcal and Hib vaccines protect against bacteria that can cause bacterial meningitis. The Bacille Calmette-Guerin vaccine protects you against tuberculosis, which can cause meningitis. But it isn't used much in the U.S. Takeaways When you have meningitis, the protective layers around your brain and spinal cord (meninges) become inflamed. Most cases are caused by viruses, but other causes include bacteria, fungi, parasites, or amoeba. Common symptoms include a stiff neck, headache, fever, nausea, and vomiting. If you think you might have meningitis, get immediate medical help. If you have bacterial meningitis, your symptoms could get worse rapidly. Meningitis FAQs Can you have meningitis without a fever? Fever is a common symptom, but not everyone with meningitis has a fever. Can a person survive meningitis? Most people survive most forms of meningitis. How well you do depends on the type you have and how quickly you receive treatment. Amoebic meningitis cases caused by Naegleria fowleri are often fatal, but these infections are also very rare. How long does meningitis last? If you have viral meningitis, your main symptoms may go away within a week. If you have bacterial or fungal meningitis, you may need more time to recover, weeks or even months. You also might have lingering effects."
87,The Dangers of Crystal Methamphetamine,"What Is Meth? Methamphetamine, or meth, is a stimulant drug that speeds up your body’s central nervous system. It boosts dopamine, which is a brain chemical that plays a part in movement and motivation. Dopamine also sends a signal that tells you to repeat behaviors that make you feel good. Common slang terms for meth include: Speed Crystal Crank Chalk Uppers You may also hear meth called: Tweak Go-fast Ice Glass Tina Meth is typically a white pill or powder that doesn’t have a smell but tastes bitter. Crystal methamphetamine usually looks like glass chunks or shiny bluish-white rocks. If crystal meth comes as more of a powder, it’ll have a bitter taste like other kinds of meth. What is crystal meth? Crystal meth is the common name for crystal methamphetamine , a strong and highly addictive drug that affects the central nervous system. There is no legal use for it. Also called “ice” or “glass,” it's a popular party drug. Usually, people who use crystal meth smoke it with a small glass pipe, but they may also swallow it, snort it, or inject it into a vein. People say they have a quick rush of euphoria shortly after using crystal meth, but it’s dangerous . It can damage your body and cause severe psychological problems. Long-term meth use can cause paranoia and aggression. (Photo credit: iStock/Getty Images) Where Does It Come From? Methamphetamine is a man-made stimulant that's been around for a long time. During World War II, soldiers took meth to stay awake . People have also taken the drug to lose weight, ease depression , and manage attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Today, the only legal meth product is a prescription pill. Rarely, it’s used to treat obesity and ADHD . Meth contains chemicals that are similar to amphetamine, a drug used to treat ADHD and narcolepsy. Find out the differences between Adderall and methamphetamines, as well as amphetamines vs. methamphetamines. Crystal meth is often made with a common cold medicine ingredient called pseudoephedrine , which helps ease congestion. Because it's used to make meth, the federal government closely regulates products with pseudoephedrine. Illegal methamphetamine may also contain chemicals found in household products such as batteries, drain cleaner, fertilizer, nail polish remover, or paint thinner. Most of the crystal meth and other meth products used in this country are made by transactional criminal organizations (TCOs) in Mexico. In addition to these Mexican “superlabs,” there are many small home labs in the U. S. Making meth is a dangerous process because of the chemicals involved. Along with being toxic, they can cause explosions. How Common Is Meth Use? Almost 2.5 million people in the U.S. aged 12 or older say they use meth every year. That’s almost 1% of the population. In general, people use it a little less often than other stimulants such as cocaine. But certain groups are more likely to use meth. Disparities in meth use In the past, middle-aged white people used this cheap drug most often. But over the past decade, rates have gone up among Black people and younger folks aged 18-23. People who commonly use meth in a risky way often face socioeconomic disadvantages, such as: Less education Low household income Less access to health insurance Unstable housing A history with the criminal justice system You may be more likely to use meth in unsafe ways if you have: HIV/AIDS Hepatitis Other sexually transmitted infections Depression Another substance use problem Meth Legality Methamphetamine hydrochloride (Desoxyn) is the only legal methamphetamine in the U.S. It’s a pill approved to treat ADHD, but doctors don’t prescribe it very often. Crystal meth and all other meth products are illegal. How long does meth stay in your system? Your body doesn’t break down meth as fast as some other stimulant drugs, such as cocaine. You may feel the effects for 8-24 hours. But it may stay in your urine or blood for around 72 hours and in your hair for up to 90 days. How long meth makes you high or stays in your system depends on several things, such as: How much you take What time of day you take it How you put it in your body (by mouth or through a vein in your arm) How healthy your kidneys and liver are Your metabolism How Do People Use Meth? There are different ways to get meth into your body. Some people swallow it in a pill form or smoke it by heating up crystals in a glass bowl or pipe and breathing in the vapors. Here’s a breakdown of some slang terms used to describe other ways people use crystal meth: Slamming. You use a needle to inject the drug right into your veins. Booty bumping. You dissolve crystal meth in water and shoot the mixture into your anus with a syringe. Some people place a crystal meth rock or meth-covered finger into their rectum. Snorting. You chop up a crystal or crush it into a powder before sniffing it. Hot railing . You heat up a glass stem until it’s very hot and place that over a meth rock or powder. Then you breathe in the vapors through your nostril. Meth Effects Drugs affect people in different ways. The way meth makes you feel depends on several things, including: Your age and body size How much you take The way you get it into your body The people around you or the place where you take it If you have other physical or mental health conditions Whether you have alcohol, medicine, or other drugs in your body How long does it take meth to kick in? You’ll usually feel a “rush” pretty quickly. But how fast meth kicks in depends on the method you use: Injecting or smoking: Within seconds Snorting: 3-5 minutes Swallowing: 15-20 minutes Meth dosage Unless you use an approved methamphetamine medication under the direction of a doctor, there’s no recommended dose for meth. The least risky (and slowest) way to use meth is to swallow it. Your odds of harmful effects go up if you put meth into your vein with a needle. But you can lessen the chances of harmful effects if you use smaller amounts of meth no matter what method you choose. Here are some typical ranges for doses: Light dose: 5-10 mg Common dose: 10-30 mg Strong dose: 30-40 mg Meth short-term effects You may feel a high similar to other stimulants, such as cocaine. Even with small amounts of meth, you may: Feel more alert and confident Have more energy Talk and move more Sleep and eat less You may get physical symptoms. Some may be uncomfortable, such as: Fast breathing Racing heart Chest pain Dry mouth Muscle tension Increase in body temperature How long does the high last? In general, you may feel the effects of meth for around 2-6 hours if you smoke it or 6-8 hours if you inject it. The high may linger a little longer if you snort or swallow the drug, lasting up to 12 hours or longer. The duration may differ for you depending on how often you use meth. Meth comedown After the high wears off, you may start to feel bad physically and emotionally. These negative feelings may equal the intensity of your high but in the opposite way. You may seek out more meth to make these feelings go away. The “meth comedown” may include physical symptoms such as: Fatigue Headache Hunger Muscle aches Shakiness You may have psychological symptoms such as: Depression Anxiety Paranoia Sadness Hopelessness Some people who use meth see or hear things that aren’t there. You may experience something called psychosis. This can cause you to think scary things that aren’t true. The odds of this happening to you are higher if you go on a multiday meth binge without sleeping. Meth long-term effects It depends on how often you use meth and your method of choice, but you could develop physical and emotional symptoms, including addiction, that negatively impact your life in big and little ways. Long-term effects of regular meth use may include: Serious weight loss because you don’t eat Constant drug-seeking Teeth problems Skin that itches so bad your scratching causes sores A feeling like you have bugs crawling under your skin Anxiety, depression, or other mood changes Confusion or trouble focusing Memory loss If you use meth often, you may also: Use poor judgment and do risky things Only feel good when they take drugs Become aggressive and violent Have extreme paranoia See or feel things that aren’t real If you use meth on a regular basis, it can change your brain’s dopamine system. This can affect how you move and think. For example, you may have problems with coordination or learning. Your chances of getting Parkinson’s disease (a movement disorder) may go up. Some of the negative effects of meth use, including hallucinations or movement issues, may go away in the weeks or months after you stop using the drug. But some changes may take years or longer to resolve or never get better. Secondhand meth smoke effects There’s ongoing research into the health effects of secondhand meth smoke. You may or may not get high around someone who uses meth. Still, you may test positive for the drug if you’re around the smoke. What Are the Signs Someone Is Using Meth? Are you worried someone you care about might be misusing meth? Consider these signs: Negative changes in how they look or care for themselves Teeth or gum damage Obsessively picking at hair or skin Loss of appetite and weight loss Dilated pupils and rapid eye movement Strange sleeping patterns -- staying up for days or even weeks at a time Jerky, erratic movements; twitching ; facial tics; animated or exaggerated mannerisms; and constant talking Borrowing money often, selling possessions, or stealing Angry outbursts or mood swings Psychotic behavior, such as paranoia and hallucinations People who use meth may also keep drug tools or paraphernalia around, including: Needles or syringes Burnt spoons Surgical tubes Meth Risks There are short- and long-term physical and emotional effects that come with frequent meth use. But there are some other risks you should be aware of, including: Drug quality Unlike medication regulated by the government, there’s no way to know what’s in drugs made in illegal labs. And meth makers commonly “cut” their products with strong chemicals or medications (such as fentanyl or other opioids) to save money. These additives may change how meth affects you or prove harmful to your health. Dangerous things found in meth products include: Lithium metal Hydrochloric acid Iodine Sulfuric acid Red phosphorus On average, illegal meth products are about 70% pure. You probably won’t be able to tell if the drug you take has dangerous stuff in it, so try to buy meth from someone you trust. Meth interactions Some people use meth with other drugs to boost the effects of one substance or another, but it’s hard to predict what’ll happen if you do this. It’s dangerous to use meth with other drugs, including: Stimulants like cocaine. This puts extra strain on your central nervous system and can lead to cardiovascular problems or drug-related psychosis. Depressants. Stimulants such as meth can cover up the effects of “downers.” That includes alcohol or other drugs such as marijuana, heroin, painkillers, or benzodiazepines. Prescription drugs. Meth doesn’t mix well with antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), amphetamines that treat ADHD, and drugs that affect your heart and blood pressure such as Viagra. Harm Reduction Strategies The only surefire way to avoid harm from drugs is to not use them. But if you choose to use meth, there are steps you can take to make your experience safer. Here are some tips to reduce harm from meth use: Lower your dose. Wait an hour or so before you try more. Use a safer method. Smoking and snorting meth is safer than using a needle. Stick with one substance. Mixing meth with alcohol or other drugs can be dangerous. Use your own drug tools. Your odds of getting viruses such as HIV/AIDS and hepatitis B and C go up if you share needles with someone who is infected. Get a naloxone kit. Ask your pharmacist or local health department for a free naloxone kit to keep at home. This drug can reverse the effects of opioids (which may be in your meth). Other safety tips include: Use meth in a safe space with people you know. Give yourself time to sleep between doses. Stay hydrated. Eat nutritious foods every day. Take care of your teeth and mouth. Take breaks from meth use. Sex and meth You may use meth to make sex more pleasurable or to lower your inhibitions. But you may not think clearly when you’re high or make the same decisions as when you’re sober. That’s why it’s a good idea to plan for how you’ll avoid impulsive or risky sex before you use drugs. Some tips for safer sex with meth include: Talk to your partner before you get high. Agree on which safer sex practices you’ll use. Have condoms and lube with you. Find out if PrEP is right for you. Make your sexual boundaries clear. Say no or stop anytime you feel uncomfortable. Meth Complications You can have serious side effects and health problems from drug use. Some can affect your physical appearance while others can be fatal. If you use meth while you’re pregnant, you may give birth early or have a baby with a low birth weight. Some meth complications include: Overamping This is a term commonly used to describe when meth speeds up your central nervous system too much. You may get physical symptoms such as: Fast or irregular heart rate Spikes in blood pressure Very high body temperature Overamping can change how you feel or think in scary ways. You may have: Serious anxiety or panic Extreme paranoia Aggressiveness or agitation Restlessness or irritability Psychosis and hallucinations Overamping can be deadly, especially if your body overheats. If that happens to you or a loved one, you should: Cool down with ice packs, water, or a fan. Drink something with electrolytes (such as a sports drink) to prevent dehydration. Call 911 if you or your loved one has a very fast heart rate, chest pain, shortness of breath, or a seizure. To manage less serious symptoms of overamping, you should: Go for a walk. Drink water or a sports drink. Try to breathe deeply. Take a cool shower or use ice packs. Go outside to get fresh air. Sleep, if you can. Meth mouth You may grind your teeth, get dry mouth, or skip good dental hygiene practices when you use meth. In addition, the drug is acidic. These things can lead to serious tooth decay or gum disease. People who frequently use meth often have teeth that break, turn black, rot, or fall out. Track marks Scars can form in your veins when you put drugs into them with needles. You may also get bruises around the injection sites or have trouble with blood flow through injured veins. Meth Addiction The powerful rush you get from using meth makes it easy to get hooked right from the start. When it's used, dopamine floods your brain to boost feelings of pleasure. You may also feel a lot more confident, social, and energetic. Meth is extremely addictive, and you may find yourself pulled toward using it more often once you feel the positive effects. You may continue to use meth because of uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms that come once the drug leaves your system. Only a doctor can diagnose you or your loved one with a substance use disorder. But signs of meth addiction include having at least two of the following symptoms over the past year: You crave meth all the time. You can’t do everyday things at home, school, or work because of drug use. You can’t stop using meth even though bad things are happening in your life. You use more meth than you plan to. You want to stop using meth and can’t. You have to use more of the drug to get the same high. You have withdrawal symptoms when you stop using meth. Some other signs of meth addiction in a loved one may include: Unpredictable or aggressive behavior Burns on fingers or lips Nosebleeds, track marks, or skin sores Big pupils Lots of extra energy Talking fast or speech that doesn’t make sense Social isolation Big behavior changes Mood swings Damaged teeth or other oral health problems Serious weight loss How common is meth addiction? A national survey on people aged 12 or older shows that 0.6% of the U.S. population, or about 1.6 million people, may have a methamphetamine use disorder. That means more than half of people who use meth go on to misuse the drug. Meth Tolerance If you continue to use meth, you can build up a tolerance. That means you’ll need bigger doses of the drug to get the same high. The more meth you take, the higher your health risks become. Get more information about how meth use affects the body. Meth Withdrawal You can have physical and psychological symptoms when you stop using meth. How you’ll feel off the drug depends largely on how often you use it and at what doses. There are two phases to the meth withdrawal timeline. Those are: Acute withdrawal. This is what happens shortly after you stop taking meth. Your withdrawal symptoms will be strongest during the first 24 hours or so and typically last about 7-10 days. But it can be a little longer for some people. Protracted withdrawal. This refers to the 2-3 weeks after the acute phase. You may have similar symptoms, but they’re usually less intense and chaotic. In general, meth withdrawal symptoms can include: Anxiety or irritability Tiredness or lack of energy Serious low mood Psychosis Strong urge to take more drugs Acute meth withdrawal symptoms may also include: Dehydration Chills Sleeping too much or too little Confusion Inability to feel pleasure In addition to the above symptoms, protracted withdrawal may include: Depression Mood swings Continued drug cravings Suicidal thoughts Increased appetite and weight gain Withdrawal can make you feel so bad that you can’t stop using meth. If you have serious psychological symptoms, you may hurt yourself or someone else. Medical detox can help you manage your withdrawal symptoms comfortably and in a safe place, lessening your chances of relapse. Meth Overdose You can have a toxic or deadly reaction when you take too much meth. And in 2021, almost 33,000 people overdosed on the drug. The risks of overdose are higher when you mix the drug with opioids or other stimulants such as cocaine, ecstasy, or amphetamines. The chances you’ll take too much meth are higher if you inject meth, but harmful or life-threatening health problems can happen no matter what method you use. A meth overdose can result in a dangerous spike in heart rate, body temperature, and blood pressure. As a result, you may get heart and blood vessel problems such as: Heart attack Irregular heart rate Stroke Organ problems Seizures Death Treatment for a meth overdose depends on what’s going wrong in your body but may include: Restoring blood flow to your brain if you’re having a stroke. Boosting blood flow to your heart if you’re having a heart attack. Treatment for any organ damage. Always call 911 or go to the hospital if you or a loved one has signs of a meth overdose. Tell emergency responders or doctors about the drug use. Health professionals aren’t there to report you to the police. Their job is to keep you safe and alive. Meth Addiction Treatment Meth addiction is one of the hardest drug addictions to treat, but it can be done. If you know someone who can’t control their drug use, ask for professional help. People who use meth often need a professional counselor or drug treatment program to help them get better. Treatment options for meth use disorders may include: Detox programs. There isn’t a drug to treat meth. But you can take medication to get through the withdrawal process. Detox usually happens at a hospital or substance use treatment center. Inpatient rehab. You’ll check into a medical facility to recover. These stays typically last about 30 days, but the timeline is different for everyone. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). This is a type of talk therapy that helps change how you think and act around drugs. Motivational rewards. This is a type of behavioral therapy. You get money or other good things to not use meth. Support groups. You may find it easier to stop using meth if you talk to people who know what you’re going through. The cost of meth addiction treatment varies. Some detox or rehab programs may cost $250 to $800 a day. Inpatient programs are typically the most expensive, costing anywhere from $5,000 to $80,000. But what you’ll pay depends on where you get treatment, how long you stay, what services you need, and your health insurance coverage. How do I pay for meth addiction treatment? By law, private insurers have to cover some of the costs of substance use treatment, and most drug rehab centers accept private and public health insurance. Your costs will depend on the type of health insurance you have and what facilities or services your provider covers. Call your health insurer to find out if you need to go to a specific doctor or place for addiction treatment. You’ll typically pay less out-of-pocket if you go to “in-network” providers. If you don’t have health insurance, search local substance use programs to find out how to get help paying for addiction treatment. To find resources in your area, use the Treatment Locator created by the Substance Abuse & Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), or call 800-662-HELP. Takeaways Methamphetamine is a highly addictive drug. You may keep taking meth to feel good or to avoid uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms once the drug leaves your body. You may have to take more of the drug to get the same high, and you can overdose on meth. Ask your doctor how to stop using it. Substance use treatment can help you recover. Crystal Meth FAQs What does crystal meth look like? It may look like tiny shards of glass or shiny ice-like rocks with a blueish-white tint. Sometimes, crystal meth may come in a sugar-like powder that’s white or brown. How does one recover from meth addiction? You can’t take medication specifically approved to treat meth. But substance use treatment with medical detox and behavioral therapies for addiction can help you recover from meth use disorder. How does meth differ from other stimulants such as cocaine? Your body quickly breaks down cocaine. If you snort it, you may feel high for only 15-30 minutes. But meth stays in your system longer. Depending on how you take it, you can feel the effects of meth for anywhere from 8-24 hours. Is crystal methamphetamine illegal? Yes. The only legal meth product is a prescription medication approved to treat ADHD. You can only get it from your doctor, but it’s not used very much. How widespread is methamphetamine consumption? In 2021, almost 1% of the U.S. population aged 12 or older said they’d used meth in the past year. That’s about 2.5 million people. In comparison, around 4.8 million people said they used cocaine in the same timeframe."
88,Scoliosis,"What Is Scoliosis? Scoliosis is a sideways curve in your backbone (or spine). Often, it shows up when you're a child or teenager. The angle of the curve may be small, large, or somewhere in between. But anything that measures more than 10 degrees on an X-ray is considered scoliosis. Doctors may use the letters ""C"" and ""S"" to describe the curve. Symptoms of Scoliosis If you have scoliosis, you might lean a little when you stand. You could also have: A visible curve in your back Shoulders, a waist, or hips that look uneven One shoulder blade that looks bigger Ribs that stick out farther on one side of your body than the other In addition to visible symptoms, scoliosis may lead to: Low back pain Back stiffness Pain and numbness in your legs (from pinched nerves) Fatigue due to muscle strain Breathing difficulty due to upper spine curve Scoliosis Diagnosis To check for scoliosis, your doctor might first ask you to bend over from the waist so they can see if your spine looks curved. Pediatricians often do this kind of exam on children. If your back looks curved, they'll likely do an X-ray to see whether it's scoliosis. Your doctor might also do an MRI to rule out things like a tumor that could cause your spine to curve. Types of Scoliosis Idiopathic scoliosis is scoliosis without a known cause. In as many as 80% of cases, doctors don’t find the exact reason for a curved spine. Congenital scoliosis begins as a baby’s back develops before birth. Problems with the tiny bones in the back, called vertebrae , can cause the spine to curve. The vertebrae may be incomplete or fail to divide properly. Doctors may spot this rare condition when the child is born. Or they may not find it until the teen years. Neuromuscular scoliosis is caused by a disorder like spina bifida, cerebral palsy, or a spinal cord injury. These conditions sometimes damage your muscles so they don’t support your spine correctly. That can cause your back to curve. Degenerative scoliosis affects adults. It usually develops in the lower back as the disks and joints of the spine begin to wear out as you age. Scoliosis Causes and Risk Factors Some kinds of scoliosis have clear causes. Doctors divide those curves into two categories -- structural and nonstructural. In nonstructural scoliosis, the spine works normally but looks curved. This happens for a number of reasons, such as having one leg that's longer than the other, muscle spasms, and inflammations like appendicitis. When these problems are treated, the scoliosis often goes away. In structural scoliosis, the curve of the spine is rigid and can’t be reversed. Causes include: Cerebral palsy Muscular dystrophy Birth defects Infections Tumors Genetic conditions like Marfan syndrome and Down syndrome For idiopathic scoliosis, family history and genetics can be risk factors. If you or one of your children has this condition, make sure your other kids are checked regularly. Scoliosis shows up most often during growth spurts, usually when kids are between 10 and 15 years old. About the same number of boys and girls are diagnosed with minor idiopathic scoliosis. But curves in girls are 10 times more likely to get worse and may need to be treated. Scoliosis diagnosed during the teen years can continue into adulthood. The more your spine is curved, the more likely it is to get worse over time. If you had scoliosis in the past, have your doctor check your back regularly. Scoliosis Treatment For mild scoliosis, you may not need treatment. Instead, your doctor might watch you and take X-rays once in a while to see if it's getting worse. Some children grow out of scoliosis. If you or your child need treatment, your doctor might suggest: Braces . In kids who are still growing, wearing a brace around your torso can stop the curve from getting worse. They're usually made of plastic. Many kids wear them 24 hours a day. You can't see them under clothes, and they don’t stop you from doing everyday activities. Spinal fusion surgery . In this operation, your doctor puts pieces of bone or a similar material between bones in your spine. They use hardware to hold the bones in place until they grow together, or fuse. The surgery can lessen the curve in your spine as well as keep it from getting worse. Spine and rib-based growing operation. This is done to correct more serious scoliosis in children who are still growing. The doctor attaches rods to your spine or ribs with hardware. As you grow, the doctor adjusts the length of the rods. Scoliosis Prevention There's no way to prevent scoliosis. So forget the rumors you may have heard, such as childhood sports injuries causing scoliosis. Likewise, if your kids are in school, you may be concerned about the weight of the textbooks they carry. While heavy backpacks may cause back, shoulder, and neck pain, they don’t lead to scoliosis. And what about poor posture ? The way a person stands or sits doesn’t affect their chances for scoliosis. But a curved spine may cause a noticeable lean. If your child isn’t able to stand upright, ask your doctor to look at their spine. Other Reasons My Back Is Crooked There are three main types of spine curvature disorders, including: Lordosis. Also called swayback, the spine of a person with lordosis curves significantly inward at the lower back. Kyphosis. This is an abnormally rounded upper back (more than 50 degrees of curvature). Scoliosis. A person with scoliosis has a sideways curve to their spine. The curve is often S-shaped or C-shaped."
89,What Is Lymphoma?,"Lymphoma is cancer that begins in infection-fighting cells of the immune system , called lymphocytes. These cells are in the lymph nodes, spleen , thymus, bone marrow, and other parts of the body. When you have lymphoma, lymphocytes change and grow out of control. There are two main types of lymphoma: Non-Hodgkin: Most people with lymphoma have this type. Hodgkin Non-Hodgkin and Hodgkin lymphoma involve different types of lymphocyte cells. Every type of lymphoma grows at a different rate and responds differently to treatment. Lymphoma is very treatable, and the outlook can vary depending on the type of lymphoma and its stage. Your doctor can help you find the right treatment for your type and stage of the illness. Lymphoma is different from leukemia . Each of these cancers starts in a different type of cell. Lymphoma starts in infection-fighting lymphocytes. Leukemia starts in blood-forming cells inside bone marrow. Lymphoma is also not the same as lymphedema , which is a collection of fluid that forms in body tissues when there is damage or blockage to the lymph system. Causes Scientists don't know what causes lymphoma in most cases. You might be more at risk if you: Are in your 60s or older for non-Hodgkin lymphoma Are between 15 and 40 or older than 55 for Hodgkin lymphoma Are male, although certain subtypes may be more common in females Have a weak immune system from HIV/AIDS, an organ transplant , or because you were born with an immune disease Have an immune system disease such as rheumatoid arthritis, Sjögren's syndrome, lupus, or celiac disease Have been infected with a virus such as Epstein-Barr, hepatitis C, or human T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (HTLV-1) Have a close relative who had lymphoma Were exposed to benzene or chemicals that kill bugs and weeds Were treated for Hodgkin or non-Hodgkin lymphoma in the past Were treated for cancer with radiation Symptoms Warning signs of lymphoma include: Swollen glands (lymph nodes), often in the neck, armpit, or groin that are painless Cough Shortness of breath Fever Night sweats Fatigue Weight loss Itching Many of these symptoms can also be warning signs of other illnesses. See your doctor to find out for sure if you have lymphoma. Getting a Diagnosis Before you have any tests, your doctor will want to know: How have you been feeling? When did you first notice changes? Do you have pain? Where? How is your appetite? Have you lost any weight? Do you feel tired or weak? What are your current medical problems and treatments? What is your past medical history including conditions and treatments? What is your family medical history? Your doctor will do a physical exam, including a check for swollen lymph nodes. This symptom doesn't mean you have cancer. Most of the time, an infection -- unrelated to cancer -- causes swollen lymph nodes. You might get a lymph node biopsy to check for cancer cells. For this test, a doctor will remove all or part of a lymph node, or use a needle to take a small amount of tissue from the affected node. You might also have one of these tests to help diagnose, stage, or manage lymphoma: Bone marrow aspiration or biopsy. Your doctor uses a needle to remove fluid or tissue from your bone marrow -- the spongy part inside bone where blood cells are made -- to look for lymphoma cells. Chest X-ray. It will be done using low doses of radiation radiation to make images of the inside of your chest. MRI . A technician will use powerful magnets and radio waves to make pictures of organs and structures inside your body. PET scan . This imaging test uses a radioactive substance to look for cancer cells in your body. Molecular test. This test is used to find changes to genes, proteins, and other substances in cancer cells to help your doctor figure out which type of lymphoma you have. Blood tests. These check the number of certain cells, levels of other substances, or evidence of infection in your blood. Questions for Your Doctor What type of lymphoma do I have? What stage is my lymphoma? Have you treated people with this kind of lymphoma before? What are my treatment options? How will the treatments make me feel? What will help me feel better during my treatment? Are there any complementary treatments I could consider along with the usual medical care? Are there any I should avoid? Treatment The treatment you get depends on what type of lymphoma you have and its stage. The main treatments for non-Hodgkin lymphoma are: Chemotherapy , which uses drugs to kill cancer cells Radiation therapy, which uses high-energy rays to destroy cancer cells Immunotherapy, which uses your body's immune system to attack cancer cells Targeted therapy that targets aspects of lymphoma cells to curb their growth The main treatments for Hodgkin lymphoma are: Chemotherapy Radiation therapy Immunotherapy If these treatments don't work, you might have a stem cell transplant. First you'll get very high doses of chemotherapy. This treatment kills cancer cells, but it also destroys stem cells in your bone marrow that make new blood cells. After chemotherapy, you will get a transplant of stem cells to replace the ones that were destroyed. Two types of stem cell transplants can be done: An autologous transplant uses your own stem cells. An allogeneic transplant uses stem cells taken from a donor. Taking Care of Yourself Lymphoma treatment can cause side effects. Talk to your medical team about ways to relieve any symptoms you have. Also ask your doctor about changes to your diet and exercise that can help you feel better during your treatment. Ask a dietitian for help if you're not sure what types of food to eat. Exercises like walking or swimming can relieve fatigue and help you feel better during treatments like chemotherapy and radiation. You might also try alternative therapies like relaxation, biofeedback , or guided imagery to help relieve pain. What to Expect Treatments have improved a lot, and many people do very well after treatment. Your doctor will talk to you about a survivorship care plan.  Your outlook depends on: The kind of lymphoma you have How far the cancer has spread Your age The type of treatment you get What other health problems you have Getting Support (Resources) You can get support from people who have gone through this kind of illness. Contact the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society or Lymphoma Research Foundation to learn more."
90,Cushing’s Syndrome,"What Is Cushing’s Syndrome? Cushing's syndrome is a hormonal disorder caused by high levels of the hormone cortisol in your body. It’s also known as hypercortisolism. Cortisol comes from your adrenal glands, which sit on top of your kidneys. It helps your body: Maintain blood pressure Regulate blood sugar Lower inflammation Turn the food you eat into energy But when you have too much cortisol, it can throw off your body's other systems. Most cases of Cushing's syndrome can be cured, though it may take some time for your symptoms to ease up. The condition is more common in women than in men. It's most often seen in people ages 25-40. Cushing’s Syndrome Causes and Risk Factors You can get Cushing's syndrome when there’s too much cortisol in your body for too long. The most common cause is related to medications called glucocorticoids , also commonly known as corticosteroids, steroids (for example, prednisone). These prescription steroids are used for conditions such as asthma , rheumatoid arthritis , lupus, or after an organ transplant . They’re powerful anti-inflammatory medications. Taking too much, for too long, can lead to Cushing's syndrome. Although rare, you can also get Cushing’s syndrome from injectable steroids, such as repeated shots for joint pain , bursitis , and back pain . Steroid skin creams, used for eczema and other skin problems , are less likely to cause Cushing’s syndrome, but it can happen. A tumor in your pituitary gland found at the base of the brain , or a tumor in the adrenal glands, can also prompt your body to make too much cortisol, which can lead to Cushing’s. ACTH is a hormone that regulates cortisol. In rare cases, an ACTH-secreting tumor causes Cushing’s syndrome. This kind of tumor can form in an organ that doesn’t naturally produce ACTH, but because of the tumor, it begins to make a lot of it. These tumors can be cancerous or noncancerous. They’re usually found in the lungs , pancreas , thyroid , or thymus gland. It's not usually a condition that's passed along in families. In some rare cases, though, people have it because a problem in their genes makes them more likely to get tumors on their glands. Cushing’s Syndrome Symptoms Your case might be different than someone else's, but when the disease is full-blown, common symptoms are: A rounded, rosy face Weight gain , especially in the upper body A fat pad in the upper back or base of the neck (You may hear this called a ""buffalo hump."") Thinning skin that is easy to bruise Acne Being very tired Weak muscles, especially when using your shoulders and hip muscles High blood pressure High blood sugar levels Depression and anxiety Osteoporosis Kidney stones Sleep problems Extra hair growth on your body and face Irregular periods Low sex drive and problems having an erection Decreased fertility Your skin could become thin, heal slowly, and bruise easily. You might get purple or pink stretch marks all over your body, especially on your belly, thighs, arms, and chest. Your bones may get weak. Everyday movements like bending, lifting, or even getting out of a chair can cause backaches or breaks in your ribs or spine . Children with Cushing's syndrome are usually very heavy, what doctors call obese , and tend to grow slowly. Cushing’s Syndrome Diagnosis It might take several appointments to settle on your diagnosis. When you go to your doctor, they'll do a physical exam and ask you questions. What symptoms have you noticed? When did you first see them? Does anything make them better? Or worse? Are you feeling more emotional? What medications are you taking? Your doctor will probably also recommend some of these tests to help screen for Cushing’s syndrome if they suspect you have it: 24-hour urinary free cortisol test. This common test collects your urine for 24 hours to measure how much cortisol is in it. Dexamethasone suppression test. You’ll take a low-dose steroid pill at 11:00 p.m. and then take a blood test in the morning to see how much cortisol your body still makes. Late-night salivary cortisol level. This test measures cortisol in your saliva . As the name suggests, these tests happen at night. If you have Cushing's syndrome, your doctor may refer you to a specialist who will do other blood tests or imaging scans to find out what's causing it. A blood test checks levels of the cortisol-regulating hormone ACTH. If levels are low, an adrenal tumor is the likely cause. If they’re normal or high, it’s probably a pituitary or ectopic tumor. A CRH stimulation test is one way to tell the difference between a pituitary and ectopic tumor. A high-dose dexamethasone suppression test is another way to tell the difference between a pituitary and ectopic tumor. Imaging tests are sometimes done to look for tumors. A test called petrosal sinus sampling takes blood samples from veins close to the pituitary and far from it. You’ll also get a shot of CRH, the hormone that causes the pituitary to release ACTH. Levels of ACTH in the blood samples help tell whether it’s a pituitary or an ectopic tumor. Questions for Your Doctor About Cushing’s Syndrome Will my symptoms change? If so, how? What are my treatment options? Which do you recommend? How will we know if they're working? Do these treatments have side effects? What can I do about them? When will I start to feel better? Does this condition put me at risk for any others? Cushing’s Syndrome Treatment The first thing your doctor will figure out is why you have too much cortisol. That will lead to how to treat your condition. If you have too much cortisol because you're taking steroid medicines, your doctor will check to see if you can slowly lower your dose while still managing your asthma , arthritis , or other condition. You may need surgery to remove a tumor. You may have radiation alongside surgery if the tumor can’t be completely removed. It can also be used instead of surgery in some cases. Medications to control cortisol production may be an option when surgery and radiation don’t work. These medications can have serious side effects. A doctor may also prescribe medications before surgery in people who are very sick with Cushing’s syndrome. In some cases, the tumor or its treatment will affect other hormones produced by the pituitary or adrenal gland, and you may need hormone replacement medication. Lifestyle changes Some lifestyle changes may help you manage your Cushing’s syndrome and stay healthier: Eating well is an important part of living with Cushing's. A healthy diet can ease some symptoms and prevent others. Protect your bones by eating foods with calcium and vitamin D . Limit how much sodium and fatty foods you eat. A nutritionist can help you make sure you're getting plenty of the right nutrients. Soothe aches and pains with hot baths, massages, and gentle exercises such as water aerobics and tai chi . Let your family and friends know what you're going through. Ask for their support, and let them know how they can help. Take time for the people and activities you enjoy. It's OK to say no and set limits, so you keep your energy up. If you're feeling overwhelmed, talk to a counselor or therapist. Your doctor may be able to give you a referral. Cushing’s Syndrome Complications Cushing’s syndrome can cause serious health problems and even death if not treated. Problems may include: A heart attack or stroke Blood clots in the legs or lungs Infections Bone loss and fractures High blood pressure High cholesterol Depression or mood changes Loss of memory or trouble concentrating Type 2 diabetes Cushing’s Syndrome Outlook Your symptoms and how long they'll last depend on: The amount of extra cortisol you have The cause of your high cortisol How long you've had the condition Your overall health Most of the time Cushing’s syndrome can be treated and cured. If your Cushing's syndrome isn't curable, you'll want to look for ways to manage your weight gain, muscle weakness, and tiredness. Partner with your doctor on that, and tell your doctor how you're feeling. If you get depressed, it's important to get treated for that. Support for Cushing’s Syndrome Look for ways to connect online and in person with people who have experience with Cushing's syndrome. You can learn more about living with the condition, and meet other people who have it, in forums on the Cushing’s Support & Research Foundation website."
91,What Is Edema?,"""Edema"" is the medical term for swelling. Body parts swell from injury or inflammation. It can affect a small area or the entire body. Medications, pregnancy, infections, and many other medical problems can cause edema. Edema happens when your small blood vessels leak fluid into nearby tissues. That extra fluid builds up, which makes the tissue swell. It can happen almost anywhere in the body. Types of Edema Peripheral edema. This usually affects the legs, feet, and ankles, but it can also happen in the arms. It could be a sign of problems with your circulatory system, lymph nodes, or kidneys. Pedal edema. This happens when fluid gathers in your feet and lower legs. It’s more common if you’re older or pregnant. It can make it harder to move around in part because you may not have as much feeling in your feet. Lymphedema . This swelling in the arms and legs is most often caused by damage to your lymph nodes, tissues that help filter germs and waste from your body. The damage may be the result of cancer treatments like surgery and radiation. The cancer itself can also block lymph nodes and lead to fluid buildup. Pulmonary edema. When fluid collects in the air sacs in your lungs, you have pulmonary edema. That makes it hard for you to breathe, and it’s worse when you lie down. You may have a fast heartbeat, feel suffocated, and cough up a foamy spittle, sometimes with blood . If it happens suddenly, call 911. Cerebral edema. This is a very serious condition in which fluid builds up in the brain. It can happen if you hit your head hard, if a blood vessel gets blocked or bursts, or you have a tumor or allergic reaction. Macular edema. This happens when fluid builds up in a part of your eye called the macula, which is in the center of the retina, the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. It happens when damaged blood vessels in the retina leak fluid into the area. Causes of Edema Things like a twisted ankle, a bee sting, or a skin infection will cause edema. In some cases, like an infection, this may be helpful. More fluid from your blood vessels puts more infection-fighting white blood cells in the swollen area. Edema can also come from other conditions or from when the balance of substances in your blood is off. For example: Low albumin. Your doctor may call this hypoalbuminemia. Albumin and other proteins in the blood act like sponges to keep fluid in your blood vessels. Low albumin may contribute to edema, but it’s not usually the only cause. Allergic reactions. Edema is a part of most allergic reactions . In response to the allergen, nearby blood vessels leak fluid into the affected area. Obstruction of flow. If drainage of fluid from a part of your body is blocked, fluid can back up. A blood clot in the deep veins of your leg can cause leg edema. A tumor blocking the flow of blood or another fluid called lymph can cause edema. Critical illness. Burns, life-threatening infections, or other critical illnesses can cause a reaction that allows fluid to leak into tissues almost everywhere. This can cause edema all over your body. Congestive heart failure. When the heart weakens and pumps blood less effectively, fluid can slowly build up, creating leg edema. If fluid builds up quickly, you can get fluid in the lungs. If your heart failure is on the right side of your heart, edema can develop in the abdomen. Liver disease. Severe liver disease, such as cirrhosis , causes you to retain fluid. Cirrhosis also leads to low levels of albumin and other proteins in your blood. Fluid leaks into the abdomen and can also cause leg edema. Kidney disease. A kidney condition called nephrotic syndrome can cause severe leg edema and sometimes whole-body edema. Pregnancy. Mild leg edema is common during pregnancy. But serious complications of pregnancy like deep vein thrombosis and preeclampsia can also cause edema. Head trauma , low blood sodium (called hyponatremia), high altitudes, brain tumors, and a block in fluid drainage in the brain (known as hydrocephalus) can cause cerebral edema. So can headaches, confusion, unconsciousness, and coma. Medications. Many medicines can cause edema, including: NSAIDs (such as ibuprofen and naproxen) Calcium channel blockers Corticosteroids (like prednisone and methylprednisolone) Pioglitazone and rosiglitazone Pramipexole When they cause swelling, usually it's mild leg edema . Symptoms of Edema Your symptoms will depend on the amount of swelling you have and where you have it. Edema in a small area from an infection or inflammation (like a mosquito bite) may cause no symptoms. On the other hand, a large allergic reaction (such as from a bee sting) may cause edema on your entire arm that can bring pain and limit your arm's movement. Food allergies and allergic reactions to medicine may cause tongue or throat edema. This can be life-threatening if it interferes with your breathing. Leg edema can make the legs feel heavy. This can affect walking. In edema and heart disease , for example, the legs may easily weigh an extra 5 or 10 pounds each. Severe leg edema can interfere with blood flow, leading to ulcers on the skin. Pulmonary edema causes shortness of breath and sometimes low oxygen levels in the blood. Some people with pulmonary edema may have a cough. There may be an indent or a “pit” that remains for a while after you push on the skin in some types of edema. This is called pitting edema. If the tissue springs back to its normal shape, it’s called non-pitting edema. It’s a symptom that may help your doctor figure out the cause of your edema. Treatment of Edema To treat edema, you often must treat its underlying cause. For example, you might take allergy medications to treat swelling from allergies. Edema from a block in fluid drainage can sometimes be treated by getting the drainage flowing again. A blood clot in the leg is treated with blood thinners. They break down the clot and get drainage back to normal. A tumor that blocks blood or lymph can sometimes be shrunk or removed with surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation. Leg edema related to congestive heart failure or liver disease can be treated with a diuretic (sometimes called a ''water pill'') like furosemide (Lasix). When you can pee more, fluid from the legs can flow back into the blood. Limiting how much sodium you eat can also help."
92,What Are Cyclic Migraines?,"As the name suggests, these are migraines that happen in cycles. They’re sometimes called cluster migraines, but that’s not correct. They’re not the same as cluster headaches , which are short, intense, and happen daily. They also differ from regular migraines in how long they last and how they’re treated. Symptoms They may happen every day or several times a week for 1 to 6 weeks, with low-grade head pain in between. On average, people who get them have about 10 attacks a month. They can last anywhere from a few hours up to 2 days during this “on” cycle. The average attack lasts about 6 hours. It’s followed by an “off” cycle that can last for weeks or months. You may feel them on one side or both sides of your head. If it starts on one side, it may move to the other side as the attack happens. Before it starts, you may see auras or notice that your vision isn’t right -- kind of like a blind spot. Other signs (called premonitory signs) that one is coming on include: Tiredness A hard time concentrating A stiff neck Depression may go along with them. It can start before or during an attack. Like the regular kind, cyclic migraines may cause nausea , vomiting, or sensitivity to light and sound. Who’s at Risk This type of headache tends to begin by the time you’re 20 years old. Most of the people who have them are female. More than half have a family history of migraines . Diagnosis There is no single test that can diagnose this condition. Your doctor will start with a review of your medical history. They’ll also try to rule out other causes with: Blood tests: These can rule out blood vessel problems and infections. MRI : Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows your brain and blood vessels. It helps doctors rule out tumors, bleeding in the brain , and other neurological issues. CT scan : A computerized tomography (CT) scan uses X-rays to show detailed images of different parts of your brain. Doctors will check for brain damage . Spinal tap : If your doctor thinks you have an infection or bleeding in the brain, they may recommend a spinal tap. This is also known as a lumbar puncture. Your doctor will use a needle to take a sample of your spinal fluid and have it tested in a lab. Your doctor will go through your migraine history in detail. They’ll ask how often they happen, how much pain they cause, what symptoms come with them, and how much they affect your daily life. Causes The exact cause isn’t completely understood. But these two things may play a role: Changes in brain chemicals , including serotonin levels, which drop when you have a migraine Hormonal changes, such as a drop in estrogen in women before or during their periods, or when pregnant or going through menopause Changes in how your brain interacts with a nerve in your head called the trigeminal nerve may be an important part of it. Imbalances in brain chemicals may also play a part. Serotonin levels drop during a migraine attack. This chemical helps to manage pain in your nervous system . Treatment and Side Effects The treatment for cyclic migraines differs from that for the regular kind. For those, your doctor may suggest a nonprescription non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), such as acetaminophen , aspirin , or ibuprofen . They may also advise caffeine . The most effective treatment for the cyclic type is lithium carbonate. This is a lithium salt that comes as a tablet. It calms the central nervous system to act as a mood stabilizer. You need a prescription to get it. The most common side effects of lithium carbonate are: Drowsiness Nausea Loss of appetite Diarrhea Dizziness Slight hand tremors A need to pee more often More thirst Your doctor also may prescribe indomethacin. This is an NSAID used to relieve pain. Most people can take this drug without side effects. But some may have an upset stomach, heartburn , indigestion , or nausea. If you have kidney or heart disease , talk with your doctor before you take this kind of drug. Management A migraine journal can help you manage your attacks. Write down when you have them and how long they last. Include any symptoms you had before it started. Keep track of the pain level and what makes it feel better. Also, make notes on what doesn’t work. When you see your doctor, you’ll have the answers to their questions in your journal. You won’t have to rely on your memory. Detailed answers will help them identify and diagnose your condition. Your journal may help you pinpoint your triggers -- the things that cause your migraines to start -- and avoid them. The most common ones include: Stress Changes in sleep patterns, whether too much or too little Changes in weather Dehydration Alcohol Some types of foods, such as chocolate , dairy products, artificial sweeteners , and caffeine Strong smells such as foods, chemicals, or perfume"
93,What Is Pudendal Neuralgia?,"Pudendal neuralgia is a condition that causes pain, discomfort, or numbness in your pelvis or genitals. It happens when a major nerve in the lower body is damaged or irritated, and it can make it hard to use the bathroom, have sex, or sit down. The pain comes and goes. It’s not clear exactly how many people have this condition, but experts believe it’s rare. The pudendal nerve runs from the back of the pelvis to near the base of your penis or vagina, where it branches off into other nerves. It sends messages to the brain from your genitals, anus, and other nearby body parts. It controls the sphincter muscles that open and close when you use the bathroom. Causes There are several things that can damage your pudendal nerve. It can happen when you’re injured, have surgery, or give birth. A tumor or an infection can squeeze or irritate it. And sometimes, certain types of exercise, like spending a lot of time on a bicycle, can cause the problem. Symptoms You usually feel pudendal neuralgia symptoms in your lower body, genitals, or perineum (the area between your genitals and anus). These may include: A sharp or burning pain More sensitivity Numbness or a pins-and-needles feeling, like when your leg falls asleep A swollen feeling These feelings might be worse when you sit down. Or you may have symptoms on both sides of your body, and they might go into your belly, buttocks, or legs. You also may have problems such as: A sudden or frequent need to go to the bathroom Trouble or pain during sex For men, problems getting an erection Diagnosis If you have pelvic pain, tell your doctor. At your appointment, you’ll answer questions about your symptoms and get a physical examination . Your doctor will put a finger into your vagina or rectum and put pressure on the nerve to check on it. You might also get an imaging test with an MRI machine. It uses powerful magnets and radio waves to take a picture of your body’s internal organs. Your doctor may also give you a pudendal nerve block . This is a shot you get in your pelvis to numb the nerve and see if your symptoms go away. Treatment Most people with pudendal neuralgia get treatment with a combination of physical therapy, lifestyle changes, and medicines. Sit up straight or stand more often to help with nerve pain. This can take pressure off the pudendal nerve. Don’t do squats or cycle. Certain exercises can make pudendal neuralgia worse. Go for physical therapy. It relaxes and stretches the muscles at the lower end of your pelvis, known as the pelvic floor. This can ease pressure that may irritate the pudendal nerve. If pudendal neuralgia makes it hard to control your bladder or bowels, physical therapy can help with that, too. Try prescription medication . Muscle relaxants may help relieve symptoms of pudendal neuralgia. Drugs used to treat other conditions, like depression or epilepsy , might also help. If these don’t work, your doctor may give you a shot of medications that numb the nerve or lower inflammation, which lessens pressure. These may take several weeks to fully take effect. In rare cases, your doctor may recommend surgery to remove anything that presses on the nerve. You may also get a small electrical device put under your skin to stimulate the nerve and interrupt the pain signals it sends to the brain."
94,What Is Brucellosis?,"Brucellosis is an infectious disease caused by a type of bacteria called Brucella . The bacteria can spread from animals to humans. There are several different strains of Brucella bacteria. Some types are seen in cows. Others occur in dogs, pigs, sheep, goats, and camels. Recently, scientists have seen new strains in the red fox and certain marine animals, including seals. Brucella in animals cannot be cured. Brucellosis is rare in the U.S. because of effective animal disease control programs. Fewer than 200 people get sick with the disease each year in the U.S. It is most often seen in the spring and summer months in: Texas California Virginia Florida Brucellosis is considered a significant health threat in other parts of the world. The disease has been reported in more than a half-million people each year in 100 countries, according to the World Health Organization. What Causes Brucellosis? Brucellosis in humans occurs when a person comes into contact with an animal or animal product infected with the Brucella bacteria. Very rarely, the bacteria may spread from person to person. Breastfeeding moms with brucellosis may pass the bacteria to their baby. Brucella may also be spread through sexual contact. The bacteria can enter your body: Through a cut or scratch in the skin When you breathe in contaminated air (rare) When you eat or drink something contaminated with the bacteria, such as unpasteurized milk or undercooked meat Four types of Brucella bacteria cause the majority of brucellosis infections in humans: B. melitensis . This type causes most cases of human brucellosis and is mainly found in sheep and goats. It is most often seen in: Spain Greece Latin America Middle East India B. suis . This infection found in wild pigs is the most common type of Brucella seen in the U.S. Brucellosis due to this strain most often occurs in the Southeast and California. It also occurs in Europe, South America, and Southeast Asia. B. canis. The infection from this type of bacteria spreads from dogs. It is most often seen in: North, Central, and South America Japan Central Europe B. abortus . This infection comes from cattle. It occurs worldwide. It has been wiped out in several European countries, Japan, Israel, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Can I Get Brucellosis From My Dog? Dogs can become infected with B. canis . Some pet owners have developed brucellosis this way but the disease is usually mild. There is at least one known case of brucellosis spreading to a human by a dog bite . But spreading brucellosis this way is uncommon. Most dogs infected with Brucella do NOT spread the bacteria to their owners. You are more likely to get brucellosis from an infected dog if you come in contact with blood or other fluids from the animal. Veterinarians have an increased risk of brucellosis. If you have a weakened immune system due to medications or certain diseases, you should not touch dogs that are infected with Brucella . What Are the Risk Factors for Brucellosis? In the U.S., brucellosis is more common in men. Men who become sick with the disease most often work or have worked around livestock. Brucellosis is uncommon in children. You are more likely to get brucellosis if you: Eat or drink unpasteurized dairy products from cows, goats, or other animals that are infected with the bacteria Eat other unpasteurized cheeses called ""village cheeses."" These come from high-risk regions, including the Mediterranean Travel to areas where Brucella is common Work in a meat-processing plant or slaughterhouse Work on a farm Brucellosis has also been reported in: Hunters in the U.S. Veterinarians who have immunized cattle with the Brucella vaccine What Are the Symptoms of Brucellosis? General symptoms of brucellosis are often vague and similar to the flu. They may include: Fever (the most common symptom, with high ""spikes"" that usually occur in the afternoon) Back pain Body-wide aches and pains Poor appetite and weight loss Headache Night sweats Weakness Abdominal pain Cough Symptoms usually appear within five to 30 days after you come in contact with the bacteria. How bad your symptoms are depends on what type of Brucella is making you sick: B. abortus usually causes mild or moderate symptoms, but they are more likely to become chronic (long-lasting). B. canis symptoms may come and go. They are similar to B. abortus infection, although people with B. canis often have vomiting and diarrhea . B. suis may cause areas of infection (called abscesses) in different organs. B. melitensis may cause sudden and severe symptoms, which may lead to disability. How Is Brucellosis Diagnosed? Your doctor will examine you. You may have: A swollen liver Swollen lymph nodes A swollen spleen Unexplained fever Joint swelling and pain A rash Blood tests will be done to diagnose the infection and determine what type of Brucella is making you sick. Proper identification of the bacteria helps pinpoint the source of the infection. How Is Brucellosis Treated? Brucellosis can be difficult to treat. If you have brucellosis, your doctor will prescribe antibiotics . Antibiotics commonly used to treat brucellosis include: doxycycline ( Acticlate , Adoxa, Doryx, Monodox , Oracea, Vibra-Tabs , Vibramycin ) streptomycin ciprofloxacin ( Cipro ) or ofloxacin rifampin ( Rifadin ) sulfamethoxazole / trimethoprim ( Bactrim ) tetracycline You will generally be given doxycycline and rifampin a in combination for 6-8 weeks. You must take the antibiotics for many weeks to prevent the disease from returning.  The rate of relapse following treatment is about 5-15% and usually occurs within the first six months after treatment. Recovery can take weeks, even months. Patients who receive treatment within one month of the start of symptoms can be cured of the disease. What Are the Complications of Brucellosis? Severe brucellosis may cause: Infection of the central nervous system Endocarditis (infection of the lining of the heart or valves) Liver abscess Brucellosis can cause long-lasting symptoms that are similar to systemic exertion intolerance disease. SEID is formerly known as Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/ Chronic Fatigue Syndrome . The symptoms can lead to disability. They may include: Fatigue Fevers that come and go Joint pain Brucellosis in a pregnant woman may lead to: Miscarriage Birth defects in the baby Death from brucellosis is uncommon. Most brucellosis-related deaths are due to endocarditis. How Can I Prevent Brucellosis? Brucellosis may be prevented with the following steps: Do not drink or eat unpasteurized dairy products. Wear rubber gloves if you work in the animal processing industry. If you have come in contact with an animal infected with Brucella , tell your health care provider -- even if you do not have symptoms. You will need to be monitored for at least six months. There is no effective human vaccine to prevent brucellosis."
95,How Do Doctors Diagnose Cystic Fibrosis?,"Doctors use many different tests to confirm that you or a loved one has cystic fibrosis (CF). These include tests that check your blood and sweat, and sometimes your stool. Your symptoms will also need to be reviewed by a doctor who specializes in this genetic disease. There are a number of ways to diagnose CF. This article examines the most common. Newborn Screening All 50 states and the District of Columbia screen babies for health conditions such as CF. This is often done with a blood test 24 hours after birth or before baby and mom leave the hospital. A nurse will draw a few drops of blood from your baby ’s heel and send the sample to a lab. There, it’s checked for a chemical made by the pancreas called immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT). The IRT-based test is just a screening test -- it’s not meant to make a diagnosis. Most babies who “fail” the IRT screen don’t have cystic fibrosis -- they just have a higher risk and need another test to confirm. If results from the second test are normal, there’s no further risk or need for more testing. Chloride Sweat Test A “sweat test” is thought to be the most reliable way to tell if someone has CF. It checks the amount of salt in your sweat. People with CF have higher levels of chloride, a compound in salt. This test can be done on people of any age. But some babies might not sweat enough and may need to be tested more than once. To do it, a doctor rubs a small area of the skin on your arm or your baby's arm with a special gel that activates the sweat glands. They’ll use a weak electrical current to push this medicine into the skin. It doesn’t hurt, but may cause a tingling, warm feeling. Sweat will collect for 30 minutes in a special sweat collection device that is attached to your arm, and then the sample will be sent to a lab. High amounts of salt will confirm CF. Carrier Testing Cystic fibrosis is caused by a faulty gene that’s passed down from both parents. You can carry this gene without having symptoms. But if you and your partner are both carriers, there’s a risk that your baby will be born with CF. If you’re thinking about starting a family , your DNA can be checked to see if you have this gene. To do this, your doctor will take a sample of your blood or swab the inside of your cheek to get a sample of cells. You may want this test if: A close family member (like a sibling or parent) has CF A close family member is known to be a carrier of the CF gene Your partner is a carrier A genetic counselor -- someone who is trained in diseases that run in families -- can explain your results to you. They can also help explain your options if your results show that you’re a carrier. Prenatal Testing “Carrier testing” is also offered to newly pregnant women and their partners. If the results show that you both have the CF gene, then you may decide to have further testing to check the health of your fetus . This can be done by: Amniocentesis: Your doctor checks the amniotic fluid (which surrounds your baby in the womb) for any signs of birth defects . This is often done between the 15 th and 20 th week of pregnancy. Chorionic villus sampling (CVS): A sample of tissue from the placenta can also be checked for the faulty CF gene. You can have this done between your 10 th and 12th week of pregnancy. Adult Testing If your doctor thinks you might have CF and you weren’t tested at birth, they may suggest that you have both a genetic test and a sweat test. Repeated bouts of pancreatitis (inflamed pancreas ), nasal polyps , frequent sinus and lung infections, and infertility are some things that may trigger your doctor’s concern."
96,Cystic Hygroma,"What Is a Cystic Hygroma? A cystic hygroma is a rare type of cyst that babies can get, usually in their head or neck, if their lymphatic system gets blocked while it’s growing. (This system helps filter out harmful things, including germs.) Doctors often find cystic hygromas before a baby is born. Only one in 8,000 babies is born with this kind of cyst . Some of them may also have certain birth defects. So if your baby has a cystic hygroma, your doctor will probably suggest tests to check for other problems. But some babies born with a cystic hygroma are healthy. Sometimes these cysts go away on their own. If not, it’s important to get surgery to remove a cystic hygroma so it doesn’t harm nearby areas of the body, become infected, or make your baby uncomfortable as they grow. Cystic Hygroma Symptoms Symptoms of a cystic hygroma depend on where and how big it is. The growth may make it hard for nearby organs and other body parts to work the way they should. In newborn babies, a cystic hygroma looks like a bulge under the skin , which may be slightly blue. Babies born with this type of cyst often have a hard time eating and may grow more slowly than those without cystic hygromas. If a cystic hygroma is near the throat, your baby may have trouble breathing . These cysts can become infected. Left untreated, the cystic hygroma can harm nearby bones and teeth . The cystic hygroma will get bigger as your baby grows, and it may grow quickly if the cyst becomes infected or there is bleeding inside it. Cystic Hygroma Causes Both a baby’s genes and their environment in the womb can cause problems with the way their lymphatic system grows. This is how cystic hygromas form. It may happen on its own or with genetic conditions such as Turner, Down, or Noonan syndromes. When adults get a cystic hygroma, it can be due to trauma or a past respiratory infection. But it’s often not clear what caused the cyst. It may even disappear during pregnancy . Cystic Hygroma Diagnosis When you’re pregnant, your doctor may find your baby’s cystic hygroma during a routine ultrasound . These cysts are usually found by the 20th week of pregnancy. You may also notice it after your baby is born or even later in your child’s life. If you find out while you’re pregnant that your baby has a cystic hygroma, the doctor will probably recommend genetic testing to see if there are other problems. These can include: CVS (chorionic villus sampling). The doctor removes some of these wispy pieces of tissue from the placenta that share your baby’s genetic makeup. Amniocentesis. The doctor tests a sample of your amniotic fluid to test for genetic conditions. You’ll also have frequent ultrasounds to watch for changes in the cyst and any complications. The doctor will likely plan for you to give birth by C-section at 38 weeks. Find a hospital where you have access to both neonatal intensive care and pediatric surgeons. The doctor can help you choose one. If your child has signs of a cystic hygroma after they’re born, they may get tests including chest X-ray, ultrasound, and an MRI or CT scan to diagnose the cyst. Cystic Hygroma Treatment Doctors use surgery to remove a cystic hygroma. If parts of it are left behind, there’s a 15% chance it will come back. Though they don’t work as well as surgery, there are other options, such as: Chemotherapy Radiation therapy Steroids Sclerotherapy (injection of a salt solution) Cystic Hygroma Complications A cystic hygroma can cause you to make too much or too little amniotic fluid, which can put your unborn baby at risk. Many times, it causes a miscarriage. A baby born with a cystic hygroma can have other complications. The mass may block your baby’s windpipe. Your baby may develop facial deformities. The cyst can lead to a skin infection called cellulitis. Surgery to remove it can cause problems including nerve damage and heavy bleeding. The cystic hygroma may grow back. As a parent, you may want to get support through groups focused on this condition, such as the nonprofit Birth Defect Research for Children and the Lymphatic Education and Research Network."
97,What Is Cystic Lung Disease?,"If your doctor tells you that you have cystic lung disease , it means you have one of a group of conditions that cause lung cysts -- sacs of tissue filled with air or fluid. Treatments can help, but your options depend on which type you have. The symptoms are similar, so your doctor may suggest you get an imaging test called high-definition computed tomography (CT) to figure out which cystic lung disease you have. If that doesn't work, you may need to get a lung biopsy . Your doctor will remove a small piece of tissue from your lung and send it to a lab for testing. Other conditions can look like cystic lung disease, such as emphysema and honeycomb lung. To confirm that you have it, your doctor will check things like how much air your lungs can hold. They'll also look at the size, wall thickness, shape, and location of your cysts. Cystic lung disease is rare. Most adults who get it have one of these four types: Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) LAM happens when muscle cells in the lung tissue grow out of control and form cysts, which eventually damage your lung tissue. It mostly affects women between ages 20 and 40. There are two types: TSC-LAM and sporadic LAM. TSC-LAM is when you have LAM and a rare disease called tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Sporadic LAM means you have LAM but not TSC. Both kinds are thought to be due to changes in the tuberous sclerosis gene. Doctors believe that estrogen plays a part in both types of LAM. The disease may get worse during menstruation and pregnancy , and after using birth control pills with estrogen. The most common symptoms of LAM are: Chest pain Tiredness Coughing a lot (may be bloody) Shortness of breath Wheezing You may also have fluid collect in the space between your lungs and chest wall, a problem called pleural effusion . It can make it hard to catch your breath. Fluid can also build up in your belly, legs, and feet . You might get a collapsed lung if a cyst tears through the lining of your lung. A collapsed lung happens when air leaks into the space between your lung and chest wall and flattens part of your lung. This is an emergency and needs treatment right away. LAM doesn't have a cure, but you can treat it with sirolimus ( Rapamune ), a medicine that can slow the disease and may even improve how well your lungs work. You could also take bronchodilators , medicines that can help open up your airways and make breathing easier. LAM can get worse over time. If it does, you may need oxygen therapy, which means you take in oxygen from a tank or machine. Pulmonary Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (PLCH) PLCH mostly shows up in young adults who are smokers or former smokers. In the early stages, you may not have any symptoms, but if you do, they might include mild shortness of breath and a cough. Later, you could have problems like: Chest pain Fever Night sweats Tiredness Weight loss PLCH begins when chemicals in cigarette smoke cause cells to grow abnormally in your lungs. As the disease gets worse, scars form and the tissue becomes stiff and thick. You may find it harder to breathe in enough air, and you'll get short of breath, even during normal activities. PLCH can cause a lung to collapse, sometimes more than once. Your doctor may suggest you get a procedure called a pleurodesis. It closes up the space between your lungs and chest wall and stops air or fluid from filling the space. It's not clear if PLCH is a cancer or an immune disorder. Either way, the first and most important treatment is to quit smoking . PLCH may stop getting worse and even get better when you quit. You may also take a steroid medicine to reduce inflammation . Some people with PLCH take a chemotherapy drug if steroids don't help. If you're very short of breath, you may need to get extra oxygen from a machine or tank. Birt-Hogg-Dubé Syndrome (BHD) BHD is caused by an abnormal gene that you inherit from a parent who has the disease. You might also get BHD if there are changes to one of your genes, called a gene mutation. Genetic tests can show whether you have it. Symptoms usually happen when you're in your 20s or 30s. Small skin bumps on your face are the most common signs of BHD. These bumps are benign tumors (not cancer) in the hair follicles. You may also have them on your neck, ears , or upper body. About 80% of people with BHD have lung cysts. The cysts usually don't cause symptoms, and your lungs work normally. Up to a third of people with BHD can have repeated lung collapses, and 15% to 30% can get kidney tumors. The tumors are usually slow growing and are diagnosed at around age 48 to 50. You should get regular CT scans of your belly to find any kidney tumors early, when treatment works best. The treatment for BHD depends on the symptoms you have. For example, your doctor may remove skin bumps with a laser. If you have frequent lung collapses, they may recommend a pleurodesis. Surgery can remove kidney tumors. Lymphoid Interstitial Pneumonia (LIP) LIP is extremely rare. Doctors believe it's both a disease and a reaction to something in the environment or to another disease. LIP may happen if you also have an autoimmune disease , especially Sjögren’s syndrome. In that condition, your immune system -- the body's defense against germs -- attacks the glands that make your tears and saliva . About twice as many women as men get LIP. It's typically diagnosed when you're between ages 52 and 56. The usual symptoms are a cough that gets worse and shortness of breath. Your doctor may suggest you treat it with steroids to lessen inflammation . If steroids aren't helpful, you may need to take medicine that tamps down the actions of your immune system."
98,Ovarian Cysts,"What Is an Ovarian Cyst? Ovarian cysts are fluid-filled or semi-solid pockets in or on one of your ovaries. They’re common, especially when you're pregnant or haven’t gone through menopause yet. Most of the time, they don't hurt or cause any problems. You might get one every month as part of your menstrual cycle and never know it. Anyone who has ovaries can get an ovarian cyst. They usually go away on their own without treatment. A cyst can be a problem when it doesn’t go away, gets bigger, causes bleeding, or starts to hurt. There’s also a chance that an ovarian cyst is cancer , but that’s rare. Types of Ovarian Cysts Most cysts are “functional.” They’re a result of your normal menstrual cycle. These most often go away on their own within 2 to 3 months. Types of functional cysts include: Follicle cyst. Your ovaries usually release one egg with each cycle. It grows inside a tiny sac called a follicle. When the egg is ready, the follicle breaks open and releases it during ovulation. If the sac doesn’t open and keeps growing, it causes a follicle cyst. Corpus luteum cyst. After an egg is released, the empty follicle usually shrinks. The follicle also starts making hormones. At this point, the follicle is called the corpus luteum. If the opening where the egg got released is blocked, fluid can collect inside to make a cyst. Other ovarian cysts aren't functional. That means they don't form as a part of your menstrual cycle. These cysts don't always mean you have a disease you need to worry about. But your doctor might watch them to make sure they don't cause you any problems. These  cysts include: Dermoid cyst. These cysts form from cells that make eggs. They start when tissues from your hair, skin, or teeth collect inside your ovary. Also called a teratoma, these cysts are almost never cancer. Cystadenoma. The cells that cover your ovary can form this type of cyst. It usually contains watery fluid or mucus and can grow larger than other types of ovarian cysts. Endometrioma. Sometimes called chocolate cysts, these complex ovarian cysts are filled with dark brown fluid. They can happen when you have endometriosis. This is a condition in which tissue similar to the lining of your uterus grows outside of it, including in your ovaries. Ovarian cancer. Rarely, an ovarian cyst may be caused by cancer. Unlike other types of ovarian cysts, these are solid masses. You can also get a condition called polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), in which your ovaries make many small cysts with immature eggs in them. When you have PCOS, you may not have monthly periods and your ovaries may not release eggs regularly. Ovarian Cyst Symptoms Most ovarian cysts are small and don’t cause any problems. Cysts more often cause trouble when they get bigger. So what does an ovarian cyst feel like? Most of the time, they don't feel like anything at all. If you do have symptoms, signs of an ovarian cyst might include:: Pelvic pain or pressure Dull ache in your back Bloating or feeling full Nausea Swelling in your belly area Pain during sex Pain during your period A frequent urge to pee or poop The ovarian cyst pain location may be on one side of your lower belly or in your back. Ovarian cyst pain may be sharp or dull, and it can come and go. Most cysts go away on their own, but you may need to see a doctor if your cyst grows large, causes symptoms, or bursts. Symptoms of a burst ovarian cyst A cyst can break open, or rupture. You'll probably feel some pain when this happens, but you might not. You may notice some discomfort a few days after your cyst bursts, too. Sometimes, when ovarian cysts rupture, you'll have discharge that looks like vaginal spotting or bleeding. Symptoms of a burst ovarian cyst may include: Sharp, sudden pain in your lower belly or back Bloating that doesn’t go away Abnormal spotting or bleeding Sometimes when an ovarian cyst bursts, it's an emergency.  Get medical help right away if you have: Sudden, serious belly pain Pain with fever and throwing up Dizziness, weakness, or feeling faint Fast breathing Call 911 or go to the hospital if you have symptoms of internal bleeding from a burst ovarian cyst, including belly pain that gets worse or signs you've lost a lot of blood like dizziness or weakness. You may need surgery to control the bleeding. Difference between ovarian cysts and ovarian cancer Less than 1% of ovarian cysts are caused by cancer. Your odds are slightly higher if you’ve gone through menopause. But no matter your age or whether you can get pregnant, it can be hard to tell the difference between ovarian cysts and ovarian cancer from your symptoms alone. Ovarian cancer and cysts both can cause symptoms like: Bloating and pressure in your belly Urges to pee often Pain in your lower belly or pelvis Pain in your lower back Fatigue Changes in how often you poop, including constipation Losing weight for no known reason But with ovarian cysts, hair on your body and face sometimes grows in unusual ways. Ovarian cancer doesn't usually cause this symptom. Your doctor can take a closer look at your ovarian cyst with an ultrasound or other type of imaging. They may also order other tests. If they think you might have cancer, they may refer you to a specialist to learn more. Ovarian Cyst Causes The most likely cause of your cyst depends on several things, including whether you still have a regular menstrual cycle. If you still get your period, some common causes of ovarian cysts include: Ovulation. Most functional cysts happen when the follicle grows like it should but doesn’t break open to release the egg. Endometriosis. People who have endometriosis, especially advanced stages of the disease, can develop endometrioma cysts. Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). You may get pus-filled cysts on or close to your ovaries if you have a pelvic infection. Abnormal cell growth. You may get dermoid or cystadenoma cysts if cells in your ovaries grow in an abnormal way. Other causes of ovarian cysts when you still have menstrual cycles include: Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) Pregnancy Noncancerous growths Cancer If you’ve gone through menopause, your ovarian cysts may be from: Noncancerous growths Fluid in the ovary Cancer Ovarian Cyst Risk Factors Things that may make you more likely to get ovarian cysts include: Age. You're most likely to get ovarian cysts when you have a menstrual cycle. Cysts are less common in those too young to have periods and after menopause. Hormonal problems. You're more likely to get ovarian cysts if you have a medical condition that affects your hormones, such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Taking fertility drugs. For instance, using clomiphene ( Clomid ) to help you ovulate can increase your risk of cysts. Pregnancy. A cyst that forms during ovulation may stay on your ovary after you get pregnant and throughout your pregnancy. Endometriosis . Anyone with endometriosis can get ovarian cysts, but it's more likely if you have a serious case. A serious pelvic infection. If this spreads to your ovaries, it can cause cysts there. A previous ovarian cyst. If you’ve had an ovarian cyst before, you’re more likely to get others. Are Ovarian Cysts Dangerous? Usually the answer is no. But some people have ovarian cyst complications. Your ovarian cyst is more likely to lead to complications or need surgery if it gets bigger than 5 to 10 centimeters (from about the size of a lime to that of a grapefruit). Ovarian torsion. If cysts grow large, they can make the ovary move and twist. This twisting, called ovarian torsion, is very painful. It also can make you feel nauseous or throw up. Rupture. Cysts can break open, causing serious pain and bleeding, especially if they're large. Sex and other vigorous activities can make a rupture more likely. A ruptured cyst sometimes heals on its own, but it can be a  medical emergency. Infected ovarian cyst. An ovarian cyst can develop from a pelvic infection, forming an abscess . If the abscess bursts, dangerous bacteria can spread through your body. This could lead to sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition. Ovarian Cyst Diagnosis Sometimes, your doctor finds a cyst during a pelvic exam. They’ll ask questions about your pain and other symptoms. A cyst can be fluid-filled, solid, or mixed. To diagnose what kind you have, your doctor may recommend one or more of these tests: Pregnancy test . A positive pregnancy test may mean you have a corpus luteum cyst. Pelvic ultrasound . This uses sound waves to make an image of your uterus and ovaries. Your doctor can confirm that you have a cyst, pinpoint its location, and figure out what kind it is. Laparoscopy. Your doctor inserts a slim instrument with a light and a camera into your belly through a small cut. They can see your ovaries and remove any ovarian cysts. Blood test. If you have a partially solid ovarian cyst, your doctor may want to test your blood for levels of a protein called CA 125 ( cancer antigen 125). It’s often higher in women who have ovarian cancer and in those who have conditions such as uterine fibroids , endometriosis , and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Ovarian Cyst Treatment Most cysts go away on their own. Your doctor may suggest: Watching and waiting. Your doctor will monitor you over time to see if your cyst goes away or changes. Medicine. There isn't any specific ovarian cyst medication. But your doctor can give you medicine if you're in pain. They might also prescribe birth control pills or other hormonal treatment . Hormone treatments won’t make the cysts go away, but they can help prevent new ones. Surgery. Some ovarian cysts need surgery. That includes those that are large, don’t go away, or cause serious symptoms. You could also need surgery if you’re near or past menopause because your cysts are more likely to be cancerous. Your surgeon may decide to take just the cyst or the entire ovary. Surgeons use two types of surgery to remove ovarian cysts: Laparoscopy .  You're most likely to have this type of surgery to remove ovarian cysts. The doctor makes tiny cuts above or below your belly button. A small tool with a camera allows your doctor to see inside, and a different tool removes the cyst. You can probably go home the same day. Laparotomy. Your surgeon will make one bigger cut in your belly, so they can get to your ovary and cyst better. You're more likely to need this kind of surgery if you have a large cyst or doctors think it may be cancerous. Takeaways Many people with ovaries get fluid-filled cysts that come and go. Usually it's nothing to worry about, but tell your doctor if you have new symptoms of pelvic pain, bloating, heavy bleeding, or bleeding outside of your period. You may need surgery or other medical treatment for ovarian cysts that get bigger, cause symptoms, or don’t go away on their own. Get help right away if you have sudden, serious belly pain along with nausea, throwing up, fever, dizziness, or other signs of a burst ovarian cyst. Ovarian Cyst FAQs What are the first symptoms of an ovarian cyst? You may not feel anything, but people often get a sharp pain or feel pressure on one side of the body. How serious is a cyst on your ovaries? Ovarian cysts usually don’t cause big problems. But tell your doctor if you think you have one. Sometimes, they can grow large and cause pain or burst open. And some ovarian cysts make it harder to get pregnant. Rarely, ovarian cysts are cancerous. What are the serious symptoms of an ovarian cyst? You may feel sick to your stomach or throw up if a cyst moves your ovary out of place (ovarian torsion) or breaks open. An ovarian cyst that bursts may cause sudden, serious, one-sided belly or back pain. You may feel lightheaded or weak if a ruptured ovarian cyst causes internal bleeding. How worried should I be about an ovarian cyst? Ovarian cysts are common in people who have monthly periods. Most go away on their own and don’t pose a serious health risk. But tell your doctor about any new or ongoing symptoms of ovarian cysts, especially if you have constant bloating, lose weight without trying, or get sudden belly pain that gets worse or makes you feel sick, dizzy, or weak."
