0,What You Should Know About Food Poisoning,"If you’ve ever had food poisoning, you probably had a good idea that’s what it was even before you talked to your doctor. It’s hard to miss the main symptoms: stomach cramps, vomiting , and diarrhea . They can hit a few hours or a day or two after you eat the food that caused the problem. Your symptoms usually pass in a few days or even in mere hours. But if your discomfort doesn’t go away, you may need to get checked and find out exactly what made you sick. You should also see a doctor if along with other symptoms you have high fever , blood in your stool, or feel dehydrated or unable to keep any food or liquid down. Your doctor may be able to tell you what caused it after running tests. But they aren’t always necessary and don’t confirm every case. Do I Have Food Poisoning? Many times, your doctor will diagnose food poisoning based simply on your symptoms. While the main symptoms are nausea , diarrhea, vomiting, and stomach cramps, you also may have a fever, headache , muscle and joint aches, or blood in your stool. You may also be dehydrated, so your mouth and throat feel dry and you don’t pee as often as you typically do. Dehydration can make you dizzy when you stand up. Rarely, food poisoning can cause blurry or double vision , tingling, or weakness. More than 250 bacteria, viruses, and parasites are known to cause food poisoning. They can exist in foods at any stage, such as when they're growing, packaged, shipped, stored, or cooked. Certain foods are more likely to harbor bad germs. These include raw eggs, unpasteurized milk and juice, soft cheeses, and raw or undercooked meat or seafood. Fresh produce is another risk. Foods made in bulk are problematic, too. A single bad egg could affect the whole batch of omelets in a buffet. You could make trouble for yourself by not washing the cutting board or your hands as you prepare different foods. Your chances of getting food poisoning are higher in the summer. In 90-degree heat, food can start to spoil within an hour. At a picnic or during a camping trip, you are more likely to eat undercooked grilled meats or to handle raw meat without access to soap and water. Bacteria can grow quickly inside tepid coolers. So if you're picnicking on a hot day, put leftovers back in with fresh ice. Common Causes In 4 out of 5 cases of food poisoning, you never find out exactly what caused it. That's OK because you most likely will get better on your own. But in cases where the culprit is found, it's usually one of the following: Norovirus , often called stomach flu , is behind more than half of the foodborne illnesses in the U.S. where the cause is known. Norovirus can sicken you not only through eating contaminated foods, but also through touching doorknobs and other surfaces or having contact with an infected person. You should wipe down the kitchen if someone in your house has it. It typically takes 12-48 hours before you feel sick. Your symptoms may last 1-3 days. Salmonella is the name of a group of bacteria. They grow in undercooked eggs and meat. But you can also get salmonella from unpasteurized milk or cheese. Some fruits and vegetables, such as melons or sprouts, can also cause it. Symptoms start within 1-3 days and can last up to a week. Clostridium perfringens are bacteria that are more likely to show up when foods are prepared in bulk, such as in cafeterias or nursing homes or for catered events. Cooking kills the bacteria but not its spores. So food left warming can grow new germs. You can get it from beef, chicken, or gravy. You may have cramps and diarrhea but no other symptoms. You get sick within 6-24 hours and are usually feeling better in a couple of days. Campylobacter comes from undercooked poultry, unpasteurized milk, and sometimes water. It may take 2-5 days to develop symptoms you can notice. But you should feel better in another 2-10 days. You can't pass it to anyone. But if it's serious, you might have bloody diarrhea. More Serious Causes Some bacteria cause fewer cases of food poisoning but can make you very sick. They can even cause death. They include: E. coli , a type of bacteria found in the intestines of animals. You can get this from undercooked ground beef, unpasteurized milk, sprouts, or any food or liquid that has had contact with animal feces or sewage. Some strains are harmless. Others can make you very sick. Listeria is an unusual bacteria that can grow in cold temperatures such as in the refrigerator. It's found in smoked fish, raw (unpasteurized) cheeses, ice cream, pates, hot dogs, and deli meats. Typically, symptoms start within 24 hours of eating the product and you have short-lived gastroenteritis with watery diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and sometimes fever. That said, it can be much more serious in older people, pregnant women, or those with weakened immune systems. The bacteria can enter the bloodstream and central nervous system and cause an infection called listeriosis. This usually happens within 10 days to a month after exposure. In addition to diarrhea and vomiting, listeria can cause unusual symptoms, including weakness, confusion, and a stiff neck. It can also be deadly. If you have any of these symptoms, call your doctor right away. Tests for Food Poisoning If your illness is severe or complicated, your doctor may run some of the following tests. Stool cultures are the most common lab test for food poisoning . Your doctor may order one if you have a fever, ntense stomach pain , or bloody diarrhea, or if there is an outbreak that is being tracked. They may also order one if you have symptoms that linger. A sample of your stool can help tell if your sickness is related to bacteria. It can even reveal the germ’s DNA “fingerprint” and which antibiotics will kill it. Viruses are more difficult to see in culture,  so if the specific virus needs to be identified, your doctor may order stool tests to look for the germ's DNA fingerprint.Microscopic exams of stool can identify parasites. Stool tests aren’t always accurate, and they can take several days to come back. Blood tests may be ordered if your doctor thinks the infection has spread into the blood. Blood tests can detect the bacteria Listeria monocytogenes and the hepatitis A virus. Specific blood tests can tell how sick you are by looking for inflammation and signs that you’re dehydrated. Stool or blood tests can check for toxins, such as for botulism, which can be deadly. Imaging tests such as MRIs and CT scans aren’t often used in food poisoning cases. But they can help rule out other causes for your symptoms. Could It Be Something Else? A host of other conditions can lead to many of the same symptoms of food poisoning . Most common is mon-foodborne gastroenteritis , which is most often caused by a virus. For instance, Norovirus causes both foodborne gastroenteritis (from contaminated food or water) and viral gastroenteritis from person to person spread. Other causes include gallbladder problems , pancreatitis , and inflammatory bowel disease . So figuring out if you have food poisoning is as much about the timing as it is about the symptoms themselves. Delayed Symptoms In most cases, food poisoning usually shows up hours or days after you’ve eaten something that made you sick.  That can make it hard to know if it's food poisoning or something else. The delay also makes it tricky to trace the illness back to the specific food or drink. But different organisms work at different speeds. For example, Staphylococcus aureus can give you cramps, diarrhea, and nausea in as little as 30 minutes after you eat or drink. This bacterium grows in meats, eggs , and cream that haven’t been refrigerated properly. Another, far less common, cause of foodborne illness is the hepatitis A virus. It can lie in wait as long as 50 days before making itself known. You can get the virus through foods and drinks that have been in contact with sewage water. You’re more likely to get the virus when traveling in developing countries. Food Poisoning Treatment Call 911 if you think the food poisoning may be from seafood or wild mushrooms, or if the person is severely dehydrated. First, control n ausea and vomiting : Avoid solid foods until vomiting ends. Then eat light, bland foods, such as saltine crackers, bananas, rice, or bread. Sipping liquids may help avoid vomiting. Don’t eat fried, greasy, spicy, or sweet foods. Don’t take anti-nausea or anti- diarrhea medication without asking your doctor. They have side effects and may make some kinds of diarrhea worse. Your doctor may give you anti-nausea medication if you are at risk of being dehydrated. It’s important to prevent dehydration : Drink clear fluids, starting with small sips and gradually drinking more. If vomiting and diarrhea last more than 24 hours, drink an oral rehydration solution. Call a doctor right away if symptoms last more than 3 days or you have: Severe belly pain Fever Bloody diarrhea or dark stools Vomiting that is prolonged or bloody Signs of dehydration , such as dry mouth , decreased urination, dizziness , fatigue , or increased heart rate or breathing rate Food Poisoning Prevention Food safety for high-risk groups Food poisoning is more common and riskier for people with weakened immune systems, infants and young children, pregnant women, and the elderly. If you fall into one of these groups, try to avoid: Sushi and other raw seafoods and partly cooked shellfish like mussels, clams, and scallops. Refrigerated smoked seafood. These usually have labels that say “Nova-style,” “lox,” “kippered,” “jerky,” or “smoked.” Smoked seafood should be safe if you cook it well or if it has been canned or stored on a shelf. Unpasteurized juice and cider, including fresh-squeezed. These drinks can be safe if you boil them for 1 minute. Soft cheeses (Brie and Camembert), blue-veined cheeses (Roquefort) and Mexican-style cheeses (queso blanco, queso fresco, Panela). These are often made from unpasteurized milk, especially when they’re sold at farmer’s markets. Feta is also often made with raw milk. Stick with hard cheeses like cheddar or Swiss. Raw or partly cooked eggs. That means staying away from cookie and cake batter (not even a lick of the spoon). Same for homemade eggnog, tiramisu, Caesar dressing, hollandaise sauce, and ice cream . If you buy one of these products at the store, check the label to make sure it doesn’t contain raw eggs. At home, cook eggs until the yolk is hard. Raw or undercooked sprouts such as alfalfa, clover, mung beans, and radishes. Premade salads from the deli that contain meat or seafood. Canned versions are safe. Pâtés or meat spreads that have been refrigerated (they may be unpasteurized). Hot dogs, cold cuts, and luncheon and deli meats, even if they’re labeled cooked. Eat them only after you’ve reheated them steaming hot. Make sure no juices from these products end up on your hands or on plates, utensils, or counters. Food safety in the grocery store Before you load items into the shopping cart: Check the ingredients for unpasteurized milk or raw eggs. Make sure the “sell by” date hasn’t passed. Don’t buy food in dented or bulging cans or in damaged packaging. Pick up meat, poultry, and seafood just before you check out to limit the time they go unrefrigerated. Wrap meats in separate plastic bags so they don’t touch other items. Go directly home after you buy your food, and put away refrigerated items right away. Food safety in the kitchen These tips will help make your home-cooked meals safe: Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Also wash hands during cooking and preparations if you switch from one food to another. Keep countertops clean. Rinse all fruits and vegetables , even if you’re not going to eat the skin. Don’t let raw meat, poultry, seafood, and eggs come into contact with other foods on cutting boards, countertops, utensils, and other surfaces. Don’t touch any foods if you have symptoms of food poisoning . Wash cutting boards and knives with antibacterial soap and warm to hot water after handling raw meat, poultry, seafood, or eggs. Wooden cutting boards are not recommended because they can be harder to clean. Do not thaw foods at room temperature. Thaw foods in the refrigerator, and use them promptly. Do not refreeze foods if they have been thawed all the way. Don’t set out eggs, meats, poultry, seafood, or milk at room temperature for long. Cooking kills bacteria. Use a thermometer to make sure meats are cooked to safe temperatures. For beef and pork, it’s 145 F. For poultry, it’s 165 F. Keep your fridge temperature below 40 F and your freezer at 0 F. Food safety while eating out You have more control over the safety of  foods cooked at home than in a restaurant. But you can still take some safe steps when eating out: Choose where you eat carefully. If the restaurant looks dirty to you, it could be a sign that it isn’t handling or serving food properly. People who eat often at fast-food restaurants are more likely to report stomach issues than those who don’t visit as often. Check with your local health department’s restaurant inspection reports. Some states and cities require restaurants to post their health ratings in a visible spot. Always ask for your hamburger or other ground meat well done. For whole steak, roast, or a chop, medium rare (145 F) can be safe. Raw-meat dishes like steak tartare are risky. Make sure there are no raw or undercooked eggs in anything you order. If you take home food, put it in the fridge within 2 hours of leaving the restaurant. If it’s above 90 F outside, make that 1 hour. Food safety while traveling Who doesn’t love a vacation? But you need to be careful when you travel, especially to developing countries. Eat packaged or dry foods. Many of the bugs that cause food poisoning prefer moisture. Dry foods such as bread or chips or factory-sealed foods such as tuna are usually a safe bet. Go for bottled, canned, or hot drinks. Carbonated drinks are a good choice, because the bubbles will tell you it’s been sealed properly. You should be good with coffee or tea if it arrives steaming hot. Avoid raw food, local wild game, and tap water and ice in developing countries. Other safety tips Breastfeed your baby if possible. Mother's milk is the safest food for young infants. Breastfeeding may prevent many foodborne illnesses and other health problems. Wash your hands with soap after handling reptiles, turtles, birds, or after contact with human or pet feces. If you have diarrhea or vomiting , do not prepare food for others, especially people in high-risk groups. Always wash your hands before preparing food or eating. Always wash your hands after using the toilet, changing diapers , or coughing or sneezing ."
1,Annual Physical Examinations,"Annual Physical Exam: The Basics The physical exam is an essential part of any doctor's visit. Surprisingly, though, there are no absolutes in a routine physical. A good doctor may be thorough or brief, but they will spend time listening to your concerns and providing counseling for your particular complaints and risk factors. Annual exams usually check your: History. This is your chance to mention any complaints or concerns about your health. Your doctor will also likely quiz you about lifestyle behaviors like smoking, excessive alcohol use, sexual health, diet, and exercise. The doctor will also check on your vaccination status and update your personal and family medical history. Vital Signs. These are some vital signs checked by your doctor: Blood pressure : Less than 120 over less than 80 is a normal blood pressure. Doctors define high blood pressure ( hypertension ) as 130 over 80 or higher. Heart rate: Values between 60 and 100 are considered normal. Many healthy people have heart rates slower than 60, however. Respiration rate: From 12 to 16 breaths per minute is normal for a healthy adult. Breathing more than 20 times per minute can suggest heart or lung problems. Temperature: 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit is the average, but healthy people can have resting temperatures slightly higher or lower. General Appearance. Your doctor gathers a large amount of information about you and your health just by watching and talking to you. How is your memory and mental quickness? Does your skin appear healthy? Can you easily stand and walk? Heart Exam. Listening to your heart with a stethoscope, a doctor might detect an irregular heartbeat , a heart murmur , or other clues to heart disease. Lung Exam. Using a stethoscope, a doctor listens for crackles, wheezes, or decreased breath sounds. These and other sounds are clues to the presence of heart or lung disease . Head and Neck Exam. Opening up and saying ""ah"" shows off your throat and tonsils . The quality of your teeth and gums also provides information about your overall health. Ears, nose, sinuses , eyes , lymph nodes, thyroid , and carotid arteries may also be examined. Abdominal Exam. Your doctor can use a range of examination techniques including tapping your abdomen to detect liver size and presence of abdominal fluid, listening for bowel sounds with a stethoscope, and palpating for tenderness. Neurological Exam. Nerves, muscle strength, reflexes, balance, and mental state may be assessed. Dermatological Exam. Skin and nail findings could indicate a dermatological problem or disease somewhere else in the body. Extremities Exam. Your doctor will look for physical and sensory changes. Pulses can be checked in your arms and legs. Examining joints can assess for abnormalities. Male Physical Exam An annual physical exam for men might also include: Testicular exam: A doctor can check each testicle for lumps, tenderness, or changes in size. Most men with testicular cancer notice a growth before seeing a doctor. Hernia exam: The famous ""turn your head and cough "" checks for a weakness in the abdominal wall between the intestines and scrotum. Penis exam: A doctor might notice evidence of sexually transmitted infections such as warts or ulcers on the penis . Prostate exam : Inserting a finger in the rectum lets a doctor feel the prostate for its size and any suspicious areas. Female Physical Exam A woman's annual exam might include: Breast exam. Feeling for abnormal lumps may detect breast cancer or benign breast conditions. The doctor will also check the lymph nodes in the underarm area and look for visual abnormalities of the breasts and nipples. Pelvic exam: The pelvic exam allows examination of the vulva, vagina , cervix , uterus and ovaries. Routine checks for sexually transmitted infections are often done. A Pap test and HPV test can screen for cervical cancer and help assess risk. Laboratory Tests There are no standard laboratory tests during an annual physical. However, some doctors will order certain tests routinely: Complete blood count Chemistry panel Urinalysis (UA) Unless symptoms already suggest a problem, however, these tests are unlikely to provide useful information. A screening lipid panel ( cholesterol test) is recommended every 4 to 6 years, according to the American Heart Association. Your doctor might check more frequently if you have risk factors for heart disease . Abnormal cholesterol levels increase the risk for heart attacks and strokes. If you are overweight or have any risk factors for diabetes, your blood sugar will likely be checked. The American Diabetes Association recommends that all adults, beginning at age 45, should be tested for diabetes -- regardless of weight. The CDC recommends that everyone over the age of 18 get screened at some point for hepatitis C. This may happen during one of your physicals. Physicals Should Emphasize Prevention The annual physical exam is a great opportunity to refocus your attention on prevention and screening: At age 45, it's time to begin regular screening for colorectal cancer. People with immediate family members with colorectal cancer or other risk factors may need to be screened before age 45. For some women, age 40 marks the time to begin annual mammogram screening for breast cancer . The American Cancer Society recommends that women ages 40 to 44 should have the choice to start mammograms if they wish to do so. Women age 45 to 54 should get mammograms every year while women 55 and older should switch to mammograms every 2 years, or can continue yearly screening. Women should talk to their doctor or other health care professional about when to start and how often to get a mammogram. There are different guidelines for breast cancer screening depending on your personal risk for getting breast cancer and whose guidelines you chose to follow. Women should weigh the benefits and risks of screening tests when deciding whether to begin getting mammograms at age 40. Healthy behaviors work far better than medicine at preventing illness, and don't require a prescription: Do 30 minutes of brisk walking or other exercise most days of the week (or about 150 minutes a week). And add in some strength training at least twice a week. Your risk for cardiovascular disease, diabetes , and some types of cancer will fall dramatically. Eat a mostly plant-based diet, low in animal fats. Above all, don't smoke. Do You Even Need An Annual Physical Exam? The annual physical exam is beloved by many people and their doctors. But studies show that the actual exam isn't very helpful in discovering problems and may lead to unnecessary tests. Leading doctors and medical groups have called the annual physical exam ""not necessary"" in generally healthy people. Exercising, keeping a healthy weight, and not smoking are enough to keep most of us in good health, with or without an annual exam. Still, no one can argue with keeping up a good relationship with your doctor through regular visits. As long as you and your doctor are paying attention to prevention and your overall health, the details are up to you."
2,Mental Health and Pica,"Pica is the persistent eating of substances such as dirt or paint that have no nutritional value. The Handbook of Clinical Child Psychology currently estimates that prevalence rates of pica range from 4%-26% among institutionalized populations. Research among non-institutionalized populations takes the form of individual case studies, making prevalence rates difficult to estimate. How Is Pica Diagnosed? If pica is suspected, a medical evaluation is important to assess for possible anemia , intestinal blockages, or potential toxicity from ingested substances. If symptoms are present, the doctor will begin an evaluation by performing a complete medical history and physical exam . The doctor may use certain tests -- such as X-rays and blood tests -- to check for anemia and look for toxins and other substances in the blood , and to check for blockages in the intestinal tract . The doctor also may test for possible infections caused by eating items contaminated with bacteria or other organisms. A review of the person's eating habits may be conducted. Before making a diagnosis of pica, the doctor will evaluate the presence of other disorders -- such as intellectual disabilities, developmental disabilities, or obsessive-compulsive disorder -- as the cause of the odd eating behavior. This pattern of behavior must last at least one month for a diagnosis of pica to be made. How Is Pica Treated? Given the risk of medical complications (such as lead poisoning) associated with pica, close medical monitoring is necessary throughout the treatment of the eating behavior. Additionally, close collaboration with a mental health team skilled in treating pica is ideal for optimal treatment of these complex cases. The Handbook for Clinical Child Psychology currently supports general behavioral strategies as the most effective treatment approach for pica, with training in which foods are edible and which foods cannot be eaten through the use of positive reinforcement. What Complications Are Associated With Pica? There are many potential complications of pica, such as: Certain items, such as paint chips, may contain lead or other toxic substances and eating them can lead to poisoning, increasing the child's risk of complications including learning disabilities and brain damage . This is the most concerning and potentially lethal side effect of pica Eating non-food objects can interfere with eating healthy food, which can lead to nutritional deficiencies. Eating objects that cannot be digested, such as stones, can cause constipation or blockages in the digestive tract, including the intestines and bowels. Also, hard or sharp objects (such as paperclips or metal scraps) can cause tears in the lining of the esophagus or intestines. Bacteria or parasites from dirt or other objects can cause serious infections. Some infections can damage the kidneys or liver . Co-existing developmental disabilities can make treatment difficult. What Is the Outlook for People With Pica? Pica usually begins in childhood and typically lasts for just a few months. However, it is likely to be more difficult to manage in children who are developmentally disabled. Can Pica Be Prevented? There is no specific way to prevent pica. However, careful attention to eating habits and close supervision of children known to put things in their mouths may help catch the disorder before complications can occur."
3,Understanding Myasthenia Gravis -- the Basics,"What Is Myasthenia Gravis? Myasthenia gravis is a chronic condition that causes muscles to tire and weaken easily. For example, if you have myasthenia gravis, you may notice that during a meal, your jaw muscles become tired and weak, interfering with your ability to chew food. After you have rested for a little while, the muscles may become strong again, allowing you to resume eating. This waxing-and-waning weakness of muscles, worsening with use and improving with rest, is a hallmark of this disease. There typically are periods when you may notice more symptoms (called an exacerbation), interspersed with periods when symptoms decrease or disappear (remission). Myasthenia gravis affecting multiple muscle groups throughout the body is called generalized myasthenia gravis. Other common muscle groups that are affected may make it difficult for you to chew, swallow, smile, shrug, lift your arm up, grip, rise to a stand, or walk up stairs. When the muscles needed for breathing are affected, a patient is said to be in myasthenic crisis. This is a life-threatening situation. Though anyone can get myasthenia gravis, those most likely to do so are women between ages 20 and 40 or men between ages 50 and 70. If a woman with myasthenia gravis gives birth, the baby may have some temporary, and potentially life-threatening, muscle weakness (neonatal myasthenia) because of antibodies that have transferred from the mother's bloodstream. Typically, during the baby's first weeks of life, the antibodies are cleared from the baby's circulation and the baby develops normal muscle tone and strength. Myasthenia Gravis Symptoms The disease most commonly affects muscles that control eye and eyelid movement, so the first symptoms you notice may be eyelid drooping and/or blurred or doubled vision. The majority will go on to have weakness in other muscle groups in 1 or 2 years. General symptoms of myasthenia gravis include: Weakness in your eye muscles Drooping eyelids Double vision Blurred vision Change in your facial expression Trouble swallowing Shortness of breath Problems speaking Problems walking and lifting things Trouble holding up your head If the muscles you use to breathe get weak enough that you can’t control them, it’s called a myasthenic crisis. This is a medical emergency that may require a ventilator to help you breathe. Around 15% to 20% of people with myasthenia gravis have at least one myasthenic crisis. They can be caused by an infection, stress, surgery, or a reaction to medication. Myasthenia Gravis Causes Under normal conditions, nerves direct your muscles to work by sending a message through an area called a receptor. The chemical that delivers the message is called acetylcholine. When acetylcholine binds to a nerve receptor, your muscle knows to contract. In myasthenia gravis, your body attacks its acetylcholine receptors. Myasthenia gravis is considered to be an autoimmune disorder. In an autoimmune disease, some of the body's antibodies (special proteins in your body that are supposed to be programmed to fight foreign invaders such as bacteria, viruses, or fungi) mistake a part of your own body as foreign, resulting in its destruction. In the case of myasthenia gravis, antibodies block, attack or destroy the acetylcholine receptors needed for muscle contraction. No one knows exactly what causes the body to begin producing the antibodies that destroy acetylcholine receptors. In some cases, the process seems to be related to the thymus gland, which helps produce antibodies. About 15% of all myasthenia gravis patients are found to have a thymoma, a tumor of the thymus. Although most thymomas are benign (not cancerous), the thymus is usually removed (thymectomy) to prevent the potential spread of cancer. In fact, thymectomy seems to improve symptoms of myasthenia gravis in some patients, even if no tumor is present. Myasthenia Gravis Diagnosis To see if you have myasthenia gravis, your doctor will start with a neurological exam. This includes a test of your: Reflexes Muscle strength Muscle tone Touch Sight Coordination Balance Fatigability (how soon your muscles weaken) Then you’ll have tests to help look more closely at symptoms of myasthenia gravis. These include: Edrophonium test. Your doctor injects you with a chemical called edrophonium chloride to see if it improves your muscle strength. If it does, that’s a sign you might have myasthenia gravis. Ice pack test. If you have a drooping eyelid, your doctor may put an ice pack on it for 2 minutes to see if the low temperature has an effect on it. Blood test. Your doctor will draw some of your blood and send it to a lab to check for certain antibodies that affect muscle nerve receptors. Repetitive nerve stimulation. This test uses electrodes on your muscles to send small electrical pulses to see if your nerves react to the signals. Single-fiber electromyography (EMG). Your doctor puts a thin wire electrode through your skin and into a muscle. It can test the electrical activity between your brain and your muscles. Imaging. Your doctor may suggest a CT scan or MRI to look more closely for a tumor on your thymus that could be causing symptoms. Pulmonary functioning tests. Your doctor tests your breathing to see if your lungs are affected by myasthenia gravis. Myasthenia Gravis Treatment and Home Remedies Your treatment will depend on your age, how severe your symptoms are, and how fast the condition is progressing. You might need one or several treatments together. Your doctor may recommend a medication such as: Cholinesterase inhibitors. These medications boost the communication between your nerves and your muscles. They can help strengthen muscles. Corticosteroids. Corticosteroids such as prednisone mute your immune system and slow the release of antibodies that could be helping block your nerve receptors. Immunosuppressants. Your doctor may add immunosuppressants to your corticosteroids to help reduce your immune system response. Neonatal Fc receptor blocker. It works by blocking the autoantibodies that cause myasthenia gravis and helps ease the symptoms. If you’re dealing with a sudden worsening of symptoms or will soon have surgery or other therapies, your doctor may recommend intravenous (IV) therapy. Choices for this include: Plasmapheresis. This procedure is like dialysis, because it filters your blood. Your blood goes through a machine that removes certain antibodies. The effects are faster than other treatments but they are not long lasting (about a month). This procedure is usually used in a crisis. Intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIg ). This therapy injects new antibodies into your bloodstream. These antibodies alter your immune system response to help with symptoms. Results typically last about 3-6 weeks. Monoclonal antibodies. Your doctor will likely recommend this option only if other treatments haven’t worked. They can have serious side effects. If your myasthenia gravis is due to a tumor on your thymus gland, you may need surgery to remove the whole gland (thymectomy). Even if you don’t have a tumor, taking your thymus out may help ease your symptoms. It may take years to see benefits from a thymectomy. You may need open surgery to remove your thymus . A surgeon opens your breastbone to get to your thymus and take it out. Another option that may work is minimally invasive surgery. There are two options: Video-assisted thymectomy. Surgeons make small cuts in your neck or chest and use a long, thin camera called an endoscope along with instruments to take out your thymus. Robot-assisted thymectomy. Surgeons make the same small cuts as video-assisted thymectomy and then use a robot with a camera and mechanical arms to remove your thymus. In addition to medical treatments, you can make lifestyle changes to help manage your myasthenia gravis symptoms, including: Save energy when you eat. If chewing is a struggle, eat at times when you have the most strength. You might find it easier to eat several small meals a day instead of longer, larger ones less often. Stick to soft foods, and take breaks between bites. Install safety aids. Put handrails anywhere you might need a helpful handle, like next to the toilet or near tables. Remove any tripping risks such as rugs or floor clutter. Let machines do the work. Switch to an electric toothbrush and can opener, or any other device that can save you strength. Wear an eye patch. It can help with double vision. Use one when you watch TV or read, and switch eyes from time to time. Plan ahead. Be smart with your strength. Do chores or errands when you feel best during the day."
4,What Is Epidermolysis Bullosa?,"Epidermolysis bullosa is a rare genetic condition that makes skin so fragile that it can tear or blister at the slightest touch. Children born with it are often called “Butterfly Children” because their skin seems as fragile as a butterfly wing. Mild forms may get better with time. But severe cases can be painful, trigger other serious health issues, and can be life-threatening. If you have this condition, you need special treatment to keep your delicate skin as healthy as possible. Types There are five major types of epidermolysis bullosa. The kind you have depends on where your blisters tend to form. Epidermolysis Bullosa Simplex: The most common type, it first shows up in newborns. It mainly affects the palms of the hands and soles of the feet . Junctional epidermolysis bullosa : While it also first appears in babies, this is a more severe form that causes blistering in deep layers of the skin. Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa: If you have this type, your skin doesn’t have collagen to hold it together, or the collagen you do have doesn’t work well. This means the layers of your skin don’t seal together like they should. Sometimes this type doesn’t show up until early childhood. Kindler syndrome: This is a mixed condition since blisters appear across different skin layers. It can also cause patchy changes in your skin coloring when it’s exposed to the sun. Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita: This form causes blisters on your hands and feet as well as in mucous membranes like the mouth . Causes Almost all types of epidermolysis bullosa run in families. If you inherited certain gene glitches from your parents, you will have it. There’s one exception. Epidermolysis bullosa aquisita is the only type that’s not inherited. It happens because of a problem in your immune system . Symptoms Usually, signs of epidermolysis bullosa first appear in babies or toddlers . Painful skin blisters are the main symptom. They can form anywhere on the skin. Sometimes they also form on the eyes , or in parts of the throat, stomach , or bladder . If these blisters become infected or scar the skin, they cause more problems. Diagnosis To confirm the condition, your doctor may take a small sample of skin and send it to a lab where experts will use a microscope to look at it. Treatment There’s no cure for epidermolysis bullosa. But there are treatments for it. If you have a severe case, you’ll care for your skin much like someone who has a burn does. You’ll need to learn how to perform daily wound treatment and how to bandage and protect affected areas. Your doctor can also prescribe a medicine to help with pain relief. In some cases, you might need surgery. If you have blisters that have fused your fingers and toes together, your doctor can separate them. Or if your esophagus , the tube connecting your mouth to your stomach , becomes too scarred, you can get surgery to widen it to help you eat. Some people with epidermolysis bullosa still find eating too painful. In that case, your doctor may suggest a feeding tube so food goes right into your stomach. Tips for At-Home Care To help prevent blisters, you have to take special care of your skin. Reduce friction. Use lotion to keep your skin moist and reduce friction. If you cover wounds, use only dressings that aren’t sticky, then loosely wrap again with rolled gauze. Wear loose-fitting clothes without tags, tight sleeves, or seams. Drain blisters. If left untreated, these can fill with fluid and become infected. Your doctor can show you the best way to drain them. Keep cool. Keep your bath water no warmer than room temperature. Stay in air conditioning as much as you can and avoid heat and humidity. Know the signs of infection. Your skin may get red or feel hot to the touch if it is becoming infected. You could also notice pus or a yellow discharge crusting at the site, a red streak under the skin, or have fever or chills. If you see any of these signs, call your doctor right away. You may need antibiotics . Check your diet . Many people with epidermolysis bullosa have low levels of iron, selenium , or vitamin D . Your doctor may suggest that you see a nutritionist about eating more foods that are rich in these vitamins and minerals. Get support. Talk to your doctor or someone you trust. You might also find it helpful to talk about your feelings to a therapist or at a support group in your area."
5,What Is Rapp-Hodgkin Syndrome? Is It the Same as AEC?,"Rapp-Hodgkin syndrome is a rare disease that can affect your hair , nails, skin , sweat glands, and teeth . It’s caused by a problem with your genes, and it’s part of a larger group of conditions that doctors call “ectodermal dysplasia.” Rapp-Hodgkin syndrome has signs and symptoms that overlap extensively with those of ankyloblepharon-ectodermal defects-cleft lip/palate (AEC) syndrome, also called Hay-Wells syndrome. These two syndromes were classified as separate disorders until it was discovered that they both result from mutations in the same part of the same gene, TP63. Most researchers now consider Rapp-Hodgkin syndrome and AEC syndrome separate disorders that are part of the same disease spectrum. If you have it, it’s a lifelong condition. Although you can’t prevent or cure it, doctors can treat it. Causes Each of your cells has two copies of every gene. One comes from your mother and one from your father. AEC is caused by a glitch in one of your genes, the TP63 gene. If either copy of your TP63 gene has the glitch, you’ll have AEC. Sometimes, you get AEC from your parents. But more often, it’s something you’re randomly born with. A parent with the glitch has a 50% chance of passing on the gene to a child. Symptoms These can differ quite a bit from person to person. It even varies for people in the same family who have AEC. Common symptoms include: Cleft lip . This is when the upper lip doesn’t fully form and has an opening in it. Cleft palate. With this, there’s an opening in the roof of the mouth . Fewer sweat glands or none at all . People with this symptom can’t sweat as much and may easily feel overheated. Fused eyelids. This means they are joined partly or totally together. There may also be problems with the tear ducts, which can lead to dry eyes and pinkeye . Growth problems. Weight gain issues, too. Hearing loss . This can lead to delays in learning to talk . Missing or unusually shaped nails . Skin erosion . This is loss of skin in some areas. It can be life-threatening in infants. Teeth problems. These can include missing teeth, wide gaps between teeth, cone-shaped teeth, and thin enamel (the hard outer covering of the teeth). Urethra problem in men . The opening of the tube that carries pee outside the body may be on the underside of the penis . Very little hair -- on both head and face -- and dry or brittle hair. Diagnosis Usually, your doctor can tell you have AEC based on your symptoms, health history, and a physical exam . You may also get a genetic test to check on the TP63 gene, but not all labs can do this test. Parents with a risk of having a baby with AEC may be able to have their baby tested before birth. Treatment Doctors can treat many of the symptoms of AEC. You’ll work with a team that may include surgeons, skin doctors, dentists, eye doctors, and others. You and your family may also want to seek counseling to work through the emotional challenges of having a rare disease. Treatments for AEC symptoms may include: Dental implants for older kids and adults . These are anchors that go into the jaw bone to hold replacement teeth. Younger kids may get dentures, which are replacement teeth that you can easily take out. Ear tubes . This is done if fluid buildup causes hearing loss and ear infections . Eye drops for dry eyes . Gentle wound care for skin erosions. You may also need to clean erosions with a weak bleach solution, such as Dakins solution, to kill germs. Speech therapy. Surgery for cleft lip and cleft palate. Surgery to separate fused eyelids . If the eyelids are joined only in a few small sections, they may come apart on their own without surgery. Wigs to hide hair loss ."
6,Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS),"What Is Stevens-Johnson Syndrome? Stevens-Johnson syndrome, also called SJS , is a rare but serious problem. Most often, it's a severe reaction to a medicine you've taken. It causes your skin to blister and peel off. It affects your mucous membranes, too. Blisters form inside your body, making it hard to eat, swallow, even pee. Getting treated right away helps protect your skin and other organs from lasting damage. SJS vs. TEN Stevens-Johnson syndrome is similar to a condition called toxic epidermal necrolysis, or TEN. TEN also causes your skin to slough off, and it's often a reaction of your immune system to a medication. It also can be caused by an infection, tumor, or vaccine. The main difference between SJS and TEN is scale. SJS usually affects 10% or less of your body's surface. TEN affects 30% or more. TEN is a life-threatening illness. About 25% of cases are fatal. SJS is much less lethal. The fatality rate is between 1% and 5%. Symptoms of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome Stevens-Johnson syndrome may feel like the flu at first. Then you'll get a rash that blisters, and your skin will peel. It can also affect your eyes and the inside of your mouth. (Photo Credit: Dr P. Marazzi/Science Source) SJS usually starts with a fever and feeling like you have the flu. A few days later, other symptoms appear, including: Painful red or purple skin that looks burned and peels off Blisters on your skin, mouth , nose, and genitals Red, painful, watery eyes The SJS rash is sometimes described as looking like a target: concentric circles that are lighter around the edges and darker in the center. SJS is dangerous. If you have these symptoms, go to the emergency room. Stevens-Johnson Syndrome Causes More than 100 drugs can cause SJS. Some of the most common are: Medicines for gout , a painful form of arthritis – especially allopurinol ( Aloprim , Zyloprim ) Pain relievers such as acetaminophen , ibuprofen , and naproxen sodium Sulfa antibiotics , a kind of drug that fights infections (including Bactrim and Septra ) Medicines that treat seizures or mental illness The medicines most likely to cause problems in kids are sulfa antibiotics , Tylenol, and drugs that treat seizures, especially carbamazepine ( Carbatrol , Tegretol ). If you're going to get SJS, it will most likely happen in the first 2 months you're taking a drug. An infection, like pneumonia or the herpes virus that causes cold sores , can also trigger SJS. This happens more often with kids than adults. Graft-versus-host disease, which you can get after a stem cell transplant, also can lead to SJS. You're more likely to get SJS if you have: HIV or other problems with your immune system, such as lupus Had SJS before Certain genes you inherit from your parents, especially a variation of a gene called human leukocyte antigen-B Radiation treatments Had a bone marrow transplant Sometimes, doctors can't pinpoint any specific cause for Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Stevens-Johnson Syndrome Diagnosis To figure out whether you have Stevens-Johnson syndrome, your health care provider will start by asking questions about your medical history, including any medications you've recently started or stopped taking. They'll also take a look at your rash. You may need more tests. They include: Skin biopsy, which involves removing a small sample of your skin. It will go to a lab to be tested. Culture, which involves removing skin, tissue, or fluid to send for testing. This can rule out infections that could be causing your condition. Imaging of your lungs to check for pneumonia, if your symptoms suggest it's causing your SJS Blood test, which involves taking a sample of your blood. It then goes to a lab to check for signs of infection. Your health care team also will look at your pain level, how fast the rash has spread, and how much of your skin is affected. Stevens-Johnson Syndrome Treatment You'll be treated for SJS in the hospital by a special team of doctors and nurses. Some people are treated in a burn center or intensive care unit. The first thing doctors will do is to stop the medication or treat the infection that made you sick. They'll also try to relieve your symptoms, prevent infections, and support your healing. Replace fluids and nutrients Your body needs to stay hydrated, and your skin needs protein to rebuild. You'll probably get fluids from an IV at first, then be fed through a tube that goes into your stomach through your nose. Wound care Hospital staff will keep your skin clean. They'll gently remove dead skin and cover bare patches with a special dressing. Eye care Your care team will clean your eyes and use special drops and creams to keep them from drying out. You could be in the hospital from 2 to 4 weeks. It takes time to recover from SJS, and most people do. Sometimes, SJS has effects that will show up years after you heal, including: Scars where your skin peeled Infections in your gums or mouth Lung problems such as bronchitis , which causes a bad cough and trouble breathing Stevens-Johnson Syndrome Complications Complications of SJS can include: Eye problems, including dry eyes, sensitivity to light, and long-term issues with your vision Pneumonia Shock Sepsis, which occurs when your entire body has an inflammatory reaction to an infection Multiple organ failure, in which more than one of your vital organs stop working properly. Those organs include your liver, kidneys, heart, brain, lungs, and small intestine. In the most serious cases, Stevens-Johnson syndrome can be fatal, but that's a relatively rare outcome. Other issues can crop up after you've recovered from SJS. Those longer-term problems might include: Sweating more than normal Dry or itchy skin Hair loss Losing your nails, or nails that are misshapen Changes to your sense of taste Dry mucous membranes that make it hard to pee Chronic fatigue Lung problems such as asthma or COPD Stevens-Johnson Syndrome Recovery Unless you get an infection, your skin will begin to heal in 2 to 3 weeks. You'll probably feel tired after you leave the hospital, and it might be weeks or months before you're feeling back to normal. If a medicine caused your SJS, you can't take it ever again. Stevens-Johnson Syndrome Prevention There's often no way to know how you'll react to certain medicines – even ones your doctor prescribes. If you're of Asian descent, you may have a gene that raises your risk of SJS. Talk to your doctor about getting tested for this gene before you take carbamazepine. If you've already had SJS, you can take steps to avoid getting it again: Tell your doctors you've had SJS. Wear a medical alert bracelet. Know the name of the medicine that caused your SJS. Avoid taking it or any drugs like it. Takeaways Stevens-Johnson syndrome starts out feeling like flu symptoms. Then you get a rash that blisters, turns into sores, and causes your skin to peel. It can affect your mucous membranes, too. It's usually a severe reaction to a medication. SJS is a dangerous disease that can have serious complications; it can be fatal. If you have it, you'll spend time in the hospital. Most people recover, although some have long-term complications. Stevens-Johnson Syndrome FAQs How serious is Stevens-Johnson syndrome? Stevens-Johnson syndrome is rarely fatal. But it's a serious disease that has to be treated in a hospital. You may need to be in intensive care or a burn unit. Almost everyone recovers from SJS, but some people have long-term complications that affect their skin, eyes, and lungs. How fast does Stevens-Johnson syndrome progress? SJS starts with a flu-like illness. Your eyes may burn, too. Then, in 1 to 3 days, a rash will appear on your skin and on your mucous membranes. With treatment, your skin will heal in 2 to 3 weeks. SJS can start up to 2 weeks after you've stopped taking the medication that triggered it. What can be mistaken for Stevens-Johnson syndrome? Some autoimmune diseases can cause your skin to blister, and that condition can look like SJS. It might also be confused with something called erythema multiforme major, another type of allergic reaction to medicine or infection."
7,What Is Ectopia Cordis?,"Ectopia cordis is an extremely rare condition in which babies are born with their hearts partially or fully outside their bodies. It tends to go hand-in-hand with other birth defects in the heart or belly area. Only eight of 1 million babies have ectopia cordis. And while most of them are either stillborn or die within 3 days after birth, there is reason for some hope. Health care teams that include doctors, nurses, occupational and physical therapists, and other specialists have helped some babies with ectopia cordis to live for weeks or even years. Causes Experts don’t know exactly what causes ectopia cordis. But they have several theories. One is that as the baby develops during pregnancy , physical changes happen that limit its normal growth. For example, fibrous bands can appear on and restrict the amniotic sac, which surrounds the baby in the womb. Or the baby ’s chest itself develops in an unusual way that stops the heart from moving down into its normal place, causing both ectopia cordis and other cardiac problems. Ectopia cordis is also commonly linked to defects in the sternum (breastbone), pericardium (membrane that covers the heart), and abdominal wall as well as to chromosomal conditions such as trisomy 18 and Turner syndrome. One recent theory is that some embryos lack a certain gene called BMP2, and that makes it harder for the heart to form and the front of the baby ’s chest to develop. Symptoms Ectopia cordis is defined by its main symptom: the heart being outside the body. Babies who have this condition often also have other “midline defects” (problems along the line going up and down in the center of the body, from the head to the groin), including: Cranial cleft (a split in the baby’s face shape) Cleft lip /palate (a split in the baby’s upper mouth ) Lungs that are not fully developed Scoliosis (curved spine) Abnormal hole in the diaphragm (the muscle between the chest and abdomen ) Diagnosis If your baby has ectopia cordis, you might find out after a routine ultrasound as early as in your pregnancy’s first trimester or the beginning of your second trimester . You might need to have another round of ultrasound to help with diagnosis. These results are key in helping you decide how to proceed. If you decide to continue with the pregnancy, your doctor will closely follow your baby’s development using a combination of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and echocardiography, a test that uses sound waves to create pictures of the heart. Your doctor may refer to where the heart is located: Thoracic: above the abdomen near the ribs and breastbone (64% of ectopia cordis cases) Thoracoabdominal: lower down in the chest toward the abdomen (18% of ectopia cordis cases). Abdominal: in the lower half of the body (15% of ectopia cases). Cervical: back toward the spine (3% of ectopia cordis cases). A diagnosis of ectopia cordis can be very stressful for families. For support and resources, try connecting with the nonprofit Birth Defect Research for Children and the Feingold Center for Children. Treatment To help protect the baby, you’ll need to give birth by a C-section. Your baby may need extra help to breathe . Doctors may insert a flexible plastic tube into their windpipe to keep air flowing, and they also may give the baby a special liquid through that tube that coats the lungs, making sure they can take in oxygen well. To treat ectopia cordis itself, the main goal of surgery is to close the open chest wall. The surgeon and health care team will also place the heart within the thorax and repair any other cardiac defects. Whether or not these surgeries can happen depends on the kind of ectopia cordis. Also, if the baby has intestines or abdominal organs outside of their body, the surgical team will insert these into the abdomen. Surgeries are often done in several steps. The first challenge is to fit the heart into a smaller-than-normal chest cavity. After your baby’s doctor does this, they will fix the sternum. Heart transplants aren’t usually an option. Other key things that affect treatment and outcomes are whether the heart is totally uncovered or if it’s covered by a serous membrane (the tissue that lines body cavities) or ordinary skin . Comfort Care Your doctor may also offer “comfort care.” This special type of care aims to prevent and relieve suffering. It enables the baby to feel soothed and comfortable through the end of life.

8,Ectopic Pregnancy: What to Know,"What Is Ectopic Pregnancy? Ectopic pregnancy happens when a fertilized egg implants itself outside of the womb, such as in a fallopian tube. A look at the symptoms of the condition and how doctors treat it. (Photo Credit: Science Photo Library/Getty Images) Usually, a fertilized egg attaches itself to the lining in your uterus. But with an ectopic pregnancy (also called extrauterine pregnancy), the fertilized egg grows outside your uterus. This can include other areas like a fallopian tube, the ovaries, in your belly, or the lower part of your cervix, which is above the vagina. In more than 90% of cases, the egg attaches itself in a fallopian tube. This is called a tubal pregnancy. How common are ectopic pregnancies? Rates are hard to determine, but one study suggests that about 1 in 50 pregnancies in the U.S. are ectopic. As the fertilized egg grows, it can burst (rupture) and can cause life-threatening bleeding. If this happens, you will need medical care right away. If you don't treat it, it can be deadly. In fact, ectopic pregnancies are the leading cause of pregnancy-related deaths in the first trimester . Can a baby survive an ectopic pregnancy? No. It's important to note that the fertilized egg in an ectopic pregnancy is not ""viable."" That means it's impossible for the egg to survive and grow into a baby that can survive in or outside your body. It will always result in a pregnancy loss. That's because the egg can't get the blood supply and support it needs to grow outside of the uterus. Ectopic pregnancy vs. miscarriage A miscarriage is when you abruptly lose a pregnancy before the 20th week. So while an ectopic pregnancy ends in a miscarriage, miscarriages can happen for other reasons like extra or missing chromosomes. Ectopic Pregnancy Symptoms At first, you may not have any symptoms of an early ectopic pregnancy. They may seem very similar to those of a normal pregnancy. You might miss your period and have discomfort in your belly and tenderness in your breasts . Only about half of women with an ectopic pregnancy will have all three of the main signs: a missed period, vaginal bleeding, and belly pain. Early signs of an ectopic pregnancy include: Upset stomach and vomiting Sharp belly cramps Pain on one side of your body Dizziness or weakness Pain in your shoulder, neck, or rectum Signs of a ruptured ectopic pregnancy An ectopic pregnancy can cause your fallopian tube to burst, or rupture. Emergency symptoms include major pain, with or without severe bleeding. Call your doctor right away if you have heavy vaginal bleeding with lightheadedness, fainting , or shoulder pain, or if you have severe belly pain, especially on one side. You might need to call 911 or head to the nearest hospital to have it treated right away. When Do Ectopic Pregnancy Symptoms Start? Symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy usually develop fairly early in the pregnancy: between the 4th and 12th weeks. Ectopic Pregnancy Locations While most ectopic pregnancies happen in a fallopian tube, an egg can also attach itself to other areas outside of your uterus. Other types of ectopic pregnancy include: Ovarian ectopic pregnancy (OEP) When a fertilized egg implants on the outside of your ovary, it causes this type of ectopic pregnancy. OEP could happen because of problems with how your body releases eggs during your menstrual cycle. It's possible that an egg is fertilized while it's still in the follicle (a structure in the ovary), and OEP may happen as the egg moves from your fallopian tube to your ovary. Abdominal ectopic pregnancy In rare cases, a pregnancy happens in the space between your abdominal wall and spine (abdominal cavity). With this type of ectopic pregnancy, the movement of fluid in the abdomen may transport an egg behind the uterus where a sperm fertilizes it. Or an embryo might move from the reproductive tract to the abdominal cavity by traveling through lymphatic channels. Cervical ectopic pregnancy This type of ectopic pregnancy happens when an egg implants in the cervical canal, and may happen because of damage to the space inside your uterus (uterine cavity). Cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy (CSEP) CSEP is when a fertilized egg attaches to scar tissue from a C-section. Since scar tissue is weaker than the lining of your uterus, it can tear and cause heavy bleeding. Symptoms of these ectopic pregnancies, like bleeding from your vagina and lower belly pain, are similar to the kind that happen in your fallopian tube. Ectopic Pregnancy Causes You may never know why you have an ectopic pregnancy. One cause could be a damaged fallopian tube. It could keep the fertilized egg from getting into your uterus. Ectopic Pregnancy Risk Factors You're more likely to have an ectopic pregnancy if you: Smoke cigarettes Are older than 35 Have a sexually transmitted infection Have scarring from pelvic surgery Had a previous ectopic pregnancy Tried to have tubal ligation (tubes tied) or tubal ligation reversal Had fertility treatments such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) It could also happen if you become pregnant while you have an intrauterine device (IUD) for birth control . Ectopic Pregnancy and Endometriosis Endometriosis is a painful condition where tissue like the kind found lining your uterus grows outside of the uterus. It usually forms on the ovaries, fallopian tubes, and tissue lining the pelvis. Scarring from the condition may stop a fertilized egg from reaching the uterus, causing an ectopic pregnancy. Ectopic Pregnancy Complications During an ectopic pregnancy, the fertilized egg is wrapped in a structure that can grow for several weeks outside your uterus. But the structure usually bursts between 6 and 16 weeks. A ruptured ectopic pregnancy can cause severe bleeding. If the bleeding isn't stopped, your body might start to shut down due to the blood loss (hemorrhagic shock), and the odds of dying from it increase. If it's treated before it bursts, it rarely results in death. If the structure does burst, it may damage the fallopian tube it was attached to. Your doctor might remove the fallopian tube during the surgery. But you have two fallopian tubes. If your other fallopian tube is healthy, you should still be able to get pregnant. But if your other fallopian tube is damaged or not there, you may have fertility issues. In this case, talk to your doctor about other ways to get pregnant , like IVF (in vitro fertilization). Ectopic Pregnancy Diagnosis Your doctor will probably do tests that include a pregnancy test and a pelvic exam. They might give you an ultrasound to look at your uterus and fallopian tubes. An ultrasound for ectopic pregnancy is a noninvasive test that uses sound waves to create images of the inside of the uterus. The test is performed by a sonographer and may be done transvaginally or transabdominally. During the ultrasound, the doctor will look for the presence of a gestational sac, the location of the gestational sac, and whether there is a fetal heartbeat. The test is painless and usually takes around 15 to 20 minutes. An abdominal ultrasound test, which is performed by moving a wand over the abdomen, may be used to confirm pregnancy or check for internal bleeding. Ectopic Pregnancy Treatment Because a fertilized egg can't survive outside a uterus, your doctor will need to take it out, so you don't have serious health problems. They'll use one of two methods: medication or surgery. Methotrexate for ectopic pregnancy If your fallopian tube hasn't ruptured and your pregnancy isn't far along, your doctor can give you a shot of methotrexate (Trexall). You only need one dose of the injection. It stops the fertilized egg from growing. Your body will absorb the egg in about 4-6 weeks. With this treatment, there's no need to remove the fallopian tube. Before you can take methotrexate, your doctor will need to run a few blood tests to measure your levels of hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin). It's the hormone your body makes when it detects a pregnancy. You won't be able to take methotrexate if you're breastfeeding or have certain health problems. Once you get the shot, the doctor will check your hCG levels during follow-up appointments. If your levels don't drop after the first dose, you might need a second dose of the same medication. You'll need to follow up until your blood no longer has hCG. It's important to note that taking methotrexate is not the same as having a medical abortion, as you could get if you had a ""viable"" pregnancy in which the fertilized egg attaches inside the uterus. For a medical abortion, you need a combination of two prescription drugs: mifepristone and misoprostol. The methotrexate that you take during an ectopic pregnancy before the egg bursts is medically necessary. It can lower your risk of dying or other serious complications. Surgery for ectopic pregnancy In other cases, you'll need surgery. The most common is laparoscopy . Your doctor will make very small cuts in your lower belly and insert a thin, flexible tube called a laparoscope to remove the ectopic pregnancy. If your fallopian tube is damaged, they may have to remove it as well. If you're bleeding a lot or your doctor suspects that your fallopian tube is ruptured, you might need emergency surgery with a larger cut. This is called a laparotomy. Surgery side effects can include: Pain Bleeding Infection Whether you take methotrexate or have surgery, you may feel tired for a few weeks and have some discomfort in your belly. You may continue to have pregnancy-like symptoms for a bit. It might take a few period cycles before you feel back to normal. After an Ectopic Pregnancy It might be hard for you to have a typical pregnancy afterward. Consider talking to a fertility specialist, especially if you had a fallopian tube removed. And talk to your doctor about how long to wait before trying again. Some experts suggest giving yourself at least 3 months so your body has time to heal. An ectopic pregnancy raises your risk of having another one. If you think you're having another pregnancy, be mindful of the changes in your body. Check with your doctor, and they can confirm it and take the necessary steps. An ectopic pregnancy can take a toll on your mental health , too. Don't hesitate to reach out to mental health experts like a licensed counselor or therapist. How to Avoid an Ectopic Pregnancy There's no way to prevent an ectopic pregnancy. But you can lower your odds with certain lifestyle choices. You can: Use a condom when you have sex. This can lower your risk for pelvic inflammatory disease and sexually transmitted infections. Avoid using a vaginal douche. Studies show that using a douche can increase the risk of ectopic pregnancy."
9,What Is Ptosis?,"When you look in the mirror, do you see sleepy-looking eyes ? Maybe your upper eyelids sag a little or cover your pupil. It could be ptosis , which is a fancy way to say ""drooping."" What Are the Symptoms? The main sign: One or both eyelids droop. It isn’t painful, but it can block your sight. You may have to tip your head back and lift your chin to see better. Or you might have to arch your eyebrows to lift your lids. Over time, these moves may affect your head and neck. If your child has it, they could also develop amblyopia , or ""lazy eye."" That's poor sight in an eye that didn't develop normally during childhood. This might happen if the lid droops so much it blocks vision or makes things look blurry. Treat it early in childhood so it doesn't cause long-term vision loss . What Causes It? You can get it several ways. Sometimes, babies are born with it. You could get ptosis as an adult when the nerves that control your eyelid muscles are damaged. It might follow an injury or disease that weakens the muscles and ligaments that raise your eyelids. Sometimes, it comes with age. The skin and muscles around your eyes get weaker. Surgery -- like LASIK or cataract surgery -- can stretch your eyelid. An eye tumor can cause ptosis, too. How Is It Treated? If it doesn’t affect your vision, your doctor may decide not to treat it. Often, doctors won’t treat children with ptosis. They will check their eyes regularly. And they'll probably treat amblyopia with drops, patches, or glasses. The doctor will also watch the eye to see if your child needs surgery as they get older. For adults, treatment usually does mean surgery. Your doctor may remove extra skin and tuck the muscle that lifts the lid. Or the doctor may reattach and strengthen that muscle. You may also be able to wear glasses with a special crutch built in. It lifts your eyelids so you can see better. That helps you avoid surgery. How Do I Manage It? Ptosis can cause problems when you drive, read, or even walk up and down stairs. If that happens, go to your doctor. Treat any other eye issues that could cause more problems. Think about surgery if your doctor suggests it for vision loss or constriction of your vision field caused by ptosis. For teens , surgery can improve not just vision, but self-esteem. Children with ptosis should see an eye doctor regularly."
10,"Eczema: Symptoms, Causes, Treatment","What Is Eczema? Eczema is a common skin condition that causes itchiness, rashes, dry patches, and infection. It's a type of dermatitis, which is a group of conditions that can inflame or irritate your skin. The most common type is atopic dermatitis or atopic eczema. “Atopic” means that you're more likely to get allergic conditions such as asthma and hay fever. Most people can manage their symptoms by getting treatment and by avoiding irritants, things that can affect your skin when you come into contact with them. Extreme itchiness is the No. 1 overall symptom of eczema, and scratching that itch only makes it worse. Over 31 million Americans have eczema. The periods of time when symptoms are at their worst are called ""flare-ups."" These can last for days or even weeks. Eczema Symptoms Eczema looks different for everyone. And your flare-ups won’t always happen in the same area. No matter which part of your skin eczema affects, it's almost always itchy . The itching sometimes starts before the rash. Your skin may also be: Red Dry Cracked Leathery Symptoms in infants In infants, the itchy rash can lead to an oozing, crusting condition, mainly on the face and scalp. It can also happen on their arms, legs, back, and chest. Newborn babies can show symptoms within the first few weeks or months after birth. Symptoms in children Children and teens usually have a rash in the bends of their elbows, behind their knees, on their neck, or on their wrists or ankles. The rash turns scaly and dry. Symptoms in adults The rash usually happens on your face, the backs of your knees, wrists, hands, or feet. Your skin will probably be very dry, thick, or scaly. In fair-skinned people, these areas may start out reddish and then turn brown. In darker-skinned people, eczema can affect skin pigments, making the affected area lighter or darker. Flare-ups can sometimes last for several days or weeks. When to see your doctor Contact your doctor right away if you've been taking steps to manage your symptoms and notice any of the following: Signs of an infection, such as a fever, redness, warmth, pus, or blisters Your eczema suddenly changes or gets worse Treatments aren’t working Learn more about eczema symptoms Types of Eczema Eczema includes conditions such as: Atopic dermatitis . This is what people usually mean when they say “eczema.” This is the most common form, and it affects more than 7% of American adults. Other allergic disorders, like asthma and hay fever, can trigger it. It often starts in childhood. Contact dermatitis . Nearly everyone gets this at some point in their lives. It happens when your skin comes into contact with something that causes a rash. The trigger can cause irritation or an allergic reaction. Triggers are unique to each person and vary by the two types of contact dermatitis: Irritant dermatitis is the more common kind and is more closely linked to people with atopic dermatitis. Triggers may include skin care products, soaps and detergents, jewelry made with nickel, and industrial chemicals like solvents and cement. Allergic dermatitis flares when your skin comes into contact with something you’re allergic to. Common allergens include poison ivy, nickel and other metals, fragrances and beauty products with fragrances, rubber, latex, and the preservative thimerosal. For some people, it takes sunlight to cause a reaction. Dyshidrotic eczema . This is a less common but more challenging form of eczema. It causes outbreaks of tiny blisters on the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, and sides of the fingers. Sweat or irritants like metals may trigger it. Neurodermatitis. This type of eczema tends to cause just one or two intensely itchy patches, often on the back of the neck, an arm, or a leg. Risk factors include having another form of eczema, like atopic or contact dermatitis, or just very dry skin. Some mental health issues like anxiety disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) can also trigger it. Women between the ages of 30 and 50 have a higher chance of getting it than other people. Nummular eczema . This coin-shaped eczema often appears after a skin injury like a burn or insect bite. You’re more likely to get nummular eczema if you or your family members have atopic dermatitis, allergies, or asthma. Seborrheic dermatitis . This happens in areas of your body with lots of oil glands. When it’s on your scalp, it’s called dandruff. It shares a common link with some other skin conditions, like psoriasis, acne, and rosacea, as well as a variety of other diseases. Stasis dermatitis. This type happens in people who have poor blood flow, usually in the lower legs. Unlike some other types of eczema, these plaques don't mean you have abnormal genes. Some lifestyle habits raise the risk too, like being overweight or not getting enough activity. Read more about the different types of eczema Eczema Causes Experts aren’t sure what exactly causes eczema. Things that may make it more likely include: An immune system response to something irritating Problems in your skin’s barrier that let moisture out and germs in A family history of other allergies or asthma Is eczema contagious? No. You can’t catch eczema from someone or pass it on to others. Eczema Risk Factors Stress and genes are among the most common risk factors for getting eczema. But there are more, including: Having very dry skin Using hair care or skin products with certain allergens Food allergies Living in cold, damp areas or swampy, hot areas Who gets eczema? You're more likely to get eczema if someone in your family has it. It's not entirely genetic, but genes increase the chances. Eczema shows up most before you turn 5, and most children will outgrow eczema. If you get eczema as an adult, you're more likely to get it either in your 20s or over age 50. Atopic dermatitis is more common in children, while forms like nummular eczema are more typical in adults. Eczema Triggers Some people have flare-ups of the itchy rash in response to things like: Rough or coarse fabric or clothing Feeling too hot or cold Household products like soap or detergent Dander from animal hair or fur Infections or colds Stress Sweat Eczema Diagnosis No one test can spot eczema. Your doctor will probably diagnose it by looking at your skin and asking a few questions. Because many people with eczema also have allergies, your doctor may order some allergy tests to look for irritants or triggers. Children with eczema are especially likely to have allergy tests . If your doctor diagnoses you with eczema, you might want to ask them: What’s the best way to add moisture to my skin? Can I use over-the-counter products, or do you need to prescribe something? Do I need to buy special soaps, lotions, and laundry detergent? Do fragrance-free or sensitive-skin products help? Are there foods that I should avoid to keep flares at bay? Are there fabrics that I shouldn't wear? What about fabrics should I wear? Do pets make symptoms worse? If sweating makes things worse, can I still exercise? What’s next if my symptoms don’t improve or I get an infection from scratching my skin? Does stress lead to flare-ups? Are long periods of time without symptoms common? Are there ways I can treat my skin to reduce my chances of another flare-up? Know more about how eczema is diagnosed Eczema Treatment The aim of eczema treatment is easing and preventing itching, which can lead to infection. Medications Your doctor may also prescribe creams and ointments with corticosteroids to ease inflammation. If the area becomes infected, you’ll probably need antibiotics. Other options include tar treatments (chemicals that reduce itching), phototherapy (using ultraviolet light), and the drug cyclosporine. The FDA has approved two medications called topical immunomodulators (TIMs) for mild to moderate eczema. Elidel cream and Protopic ointment work by changing your immune system response to prevent flare-ups. They can reduce inflammation and itching. The FDA has warned doctors to use caution with Elidel and Protopic because of concerns over a cancer risk . The two products also carry the FDA's ""black box"" warning on their packaging to alert doctors and patients to these potential risks. The warning advises doctors to prescribe Elidel and Protopic for only a short time after other eczema treatments have failed in adults and children over the age of 2. It should not be used in kids under age 2. A biologic drug called dupilumab (Dupixent) has FDA approval for moderate to severe eczema. Biologics block certain proteins from binding to receptors on your cells. This eases or prevents inflammation by keeping your immune system from overreacting. Tralokinumab (Adbry) is another injectable biologic drug. Other medication options for eczema include: Azathioprine (Azasan) Methotrexate Mycophenolate mofetil (CellCept) Phosphodiesterase inhibitors (Eucrisa ointment) Ruxolitinib (Opzelura cream) Upadacitinib (Rinvoq) Home remedies Some things you can do at home may help ease symptoms. Moisturizers. Because your skin is dry and itchy, your doctor will recommend lotions and creams to keep it moist. Creams and ointments ease inflammation and put water back in your skin to help it heal. Put them on several times a day, including right after you take a bath or shower. Petroleum jelly and mineral oil work well because they form a thick barrier over your skin. Products with glycerin, lactic acid, and urea may also help because they help pull water into your skin. You’ll use these when your skin is damp, such as after bathing, to help hold in moisture. Hydrocortisone creams and antihistamines . Over-the-counter products like hydrocortisone cream and antihistamines can also help. Hydrocortisone is a steroid that helps keep redness, itching, and swelling at bay. You can buy low-strength creams and lotions at the store. If those don’t help, your doctor may prescribe something stronger. It’s safe to put hydrocortisone on most body parts as many as four times a day for up to 7 days, as long as you’re not pregnant or breastfeeding. Keep it away from your eyes and private parts. Some people have a severe reaction to hydrocortisone. If you have trouble breathing or swallowing, or notice a skin rash after you use it, call 911. Over-the-counter allergy meds may not work well for itchy skin caused by eczema. But antihistamines that are known to cause drowsiness can help you sleep if you take them before bed. Colloidal oatmeal. Add this finely ground oatmeal to a lukewarm bath. It contains starches that seal in moisture to keep your skin hydrated and help to block irritants. Wet wraps. When your eczema is flaring, soak some gauze, bandages, or pieces of soft clothing in cool water and put them on your skin. The coolness will relieve itching, and the moisture will help creams or lotions work even better. Carefully cover the area with a dry layer (such as pajamas) and leave in place for several hours or overnight. Talk to your doctor to find out how often you can use wet wrap therapy. If you do it too much, it can cause an infection in your skin. Coal tar. People have used this product for more than 2,000 years to treat eczema and other skin problems . Although it’s messy and many people don’t like the strong smell, it may help soothe your skin. Calamine lotion can be put in the refrigerator and helps relieve itching quickly. Relaxation techniques. There’s a strong link between stress and your skin. Plus, you’re likely to scratch more when your emotions are running high. Alternative treatments Self-hypnosis, meditation, and biofeedback therapy have all been shown to ease eczema symptoms. You may also want to see a therapist. They can help you change habits or negative thought patterns that may be adding to your skin problems. Find out more about the best treatments for eczema Eczema Health Disparities Research shows that 1 in 10 Americans will get eczema during their lifetime. But adult women are more likely to get it than men. In the U.S., boys and girls are equally likely to have eczema, or about 11% of each gender. The condition is more common among non-Hispanic Black children than with any other race. For example, 2021 data from the CDC reports around 14% of Black kids under 17 had eczema, compared to 9% for non-Hispanic Asian children. Among adults, multiracial and White people have the highest incidence. One reason may be that they’re more likely than people of other races to see a doctor for a diagnosis. At the same time, Black children and adults are more likely to have a more serious and persistent form of eczema. That may be due to lack of insurance , reliable transportation, and other barriers to seeking care. Physical differences also may explain some of the disparities. For example, researchers believe that Black people tend to have drier skin, compared to Asians. And people with eczema lose their skin moisture more quickly. Eczema Complications Eczema can lead to skin infections from scratching or cracking. That can break down your skin’s barrier against bacteria and other germs. Complications with eczema can include some or all of the following: Asthma or hay fever. Either of these can happen before or after diagnosis. Food allergies. These can cause hives. Darker or lighter skin areas. This is more common in people with a darker skin color. Skin infections. If you get a skin infection, it can be life-threatening, so watch out for these and tell your doctor right away. Sleep problems. Eczema can cause these because of the itchiness. Living with Eczema Eczema can lead to many complications . But there are ways to manage your daily life and routine if you have the condition. These tips may help you avoid flare-ups and reduce costs. Eczema diet Since eczema is linked to allergens in food, there's no one specific diet you should stick to if you have eczema. With that said, it's good to focus on anti-inflammatory foods that are less likely to lead to an allergic reaction. Foods that can often be inflammatory include: Red meat Processed meats (lunch meats, hot dogs, bacon) Fried foods Foods and drinks with added sugar Trans fats Refined carbs (white bread, pastries) Snack foods such as cookies, chips, and crackers It's also important to keep in mind that allergies are highly individual. I t may take time to learn your specific allergy triggers. Some foods, like dairy, can cause inflammation even if you're not allergic and can eat them without troublesome symptoms. In time, you can find the right diet for you, whether it's paleo, Mediterranean, gluten-free, or something else. It's also important to drink plenty of water . Water helps keep your skin from drying out, which can cause flare-ups. Managing eczema There are several things you can do to ease itchiness, the main symptom of eczema: Use a cold compress at the itch site. Softly pat the itchy skin. Don't scratch it. Take an apple cider vinegar bath. Make sure your clothing is soft and breathable. Try to avoid sitting on rough things, like grass or carpet. Moisturize during the day with a product containing ceramides. Eczema and mental health There’s a strong link between eczema and emotion. While stress, anxiety, and depression don’t cause eczema, they can set off a physical reaction that includes inflammation. This can make flare-ups worse. It works the other way as well. Having eczema can make it more likely that you’ll have issues with mental health. One study found that more than 30% of adults with eczema also have a diagnosis of depression, anxiety, or both. Kids who have the condition are 2 to 6 times more likely to also have anxiety, depression, or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) than those who don’t. If they have other atopic conditions such as asthma , their risk goes up. There are many things you can do to help yourself manage your mental health when you have eczema. Meditation, spending time outside, and exercise are some things that can help you handle stress and feel calmer. If you have symptoms of depression for 2 weeks or more, talk to your doctor right away. They may suggest that you join a support group or start therapy with a mental health professional. Signs of depression to watch for include: Feeling sad, empty, or hopeless Being unable to concentrate Low energy Loss of interest in hobbies or activities you usually enjoy Thoughts of suicide Eczema costs The average out-of-pocket cost for living with eczema is about $600 per year, but it can be as high as around $5,000 per year, depending on how much care you need and how serious your condition is. Eczema Prognosis Because experts are unsure of the exact causes of eczema, it's best to treat the symptoms and reduce triggers for flare-ups. Speak with your doctor or dermatologist about what the root of your eczema might be and how to best manage it. Treatments tend to include a mixture of medications and home remedies. Can eczema be cured? There is currently no cure for eczema. But with the right treatments, like meds, ointments, over-the-counter drugs, and home remedies, you can control and manage the symptoms. What to expect with eczema Almost 50% of children will outgrow their eczema as they get older and reach puberty. For others, it could last a lifetime. If you have eczema, there are ways to treat it, but it may take some time to find the right treatment for you. There will be times when flare-ups only last days and other times where they last weeks. There may also be long periods of time when you don't have any flare-ups. Just keep in mind that this doesn't mean the eczema has gone away. Stay away from inflammatory foods and triggers such as stress. Eczema Flare-Up Prevention A few tips can help you prevent outbreaks or keep them from getting worse: Moisturize your skin often. Avoid sudden changes in temperature or humidity. Try not to sweat or get too hot. Keeping cool and keeping your home comfortable can reduce itching. Manage stress, and take time for yourself to relax. Get regular exercise . It can help to control stress and increase circulation. Avoid scratchy materials such as wool. Don’t use harsh soaps, detergents, or solvents. Pay attention to foods that might trigger symptoms, and try to avoid them. Use a humidifier in rooms where you spend the most time. If your baby is more likely to have eczema because of a family history, it’s best to breastfeed them exclusively for the first 3 months of life, or longer if possible. Doctors advise continuing breast milk for at least up to 6 months (preferably 1 year) as you introduce your baby to solid food. Babies should also be protected from such potential allergens as pet hair, mites, and molds. Takeaways You can manage your eczema by living a healthy and well-balanced lifestyle . Avoid triggers like stress, harsh soaps, and rough or scratchy clothing. Keep your skin well-moisturized. This can help you prevent flare-ups and cut down on itchiness.  If you feel your eczema is getting worse, let your doctor or dermatologist know right away."
11,What Is Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome?,"Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is a disease that weakens the connective tissues of your body. These are things like tendons and ligaments that hold parts of your body together. EDS can make your joints loose and your skin thin and easily bruised. It also can weaken blood vessels and organs. There's no cure for EDS, but the symptoms can often be treated and managed. Types of EDS There are several types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, but they all make your joints loose and weak and your skin unusually stretchy. The most common form of EDS makes your joints bend farther than they should. That makes them more likely to be dislocated or sprained . Up to 1 person in 10,000 may have this form of the illness called the hypermobility type. In the classical type of EDS, your skin is smooth, extremely stretchy, and fragile. People with this type often have scars on the skin over their knees and elbows and bruise easily. They also are likely to have sprains, dislocations, or conditions like flat feet as well as problems with a heart valve or an artery . This form of EDS happens in about 1 of every 20,000 to 40,000 people. However, some people may have a mild form of the disease and not know it. About 1 person in 250,000 is born with the vascular type of EDS. This type weakens blood vessels and makes your organs more likely to have a tear. Some of the rare types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome are : Less than 50,000 people in the US have kyphoscoliotic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. This is when babies are born with weak muscles and bones. They often have unusually long limbs or fingers and a curved spine that gets worse as they grow. They also often have eye problems , like shortsightedness or glaucoma , which is related to too much pressure inside your eye . With the arthrochalasia form of EDS, babies are born with their hip joints out of place. Their joints are extremely loose, and they have the same kind of curved spine as those with the kyphoscoliosis type. This disease affects less than 1 in a million people. Fewer than 1,000 people in the US have this type of EDS. People with this have extremely soft, doughy skin that is easily bruised and scarred. They also are more likely to have hernias. Causes EDS happens when your body doesn't make a protein called collagen in the right way. Collagen helps form the connections that hold your body's bones, skin, and organs together. If there's a problem with it, those structures can be weak and more likely to have problems. EDS is a genetic disorder. That means it's something you get from your parents. If one of your parents has this condition, you're likely to have it, too. Diagnosis Your doctor will likely start with a physical exam : They'll test how far your knees, elbows, fingers, and waist can bend. Can your thumb touch your forearm? Can you bend your pinkie more than 90 degrees? They'll pull at your skin to see how far it stretches and look for any scars the illness might have caused. They'll ask about your medical history and if you or anyone in your family had symptoms like this in the past. If your doctor thinks you might have problems with your heart or blood vessels, your exam might include an echocardiogram, which uses sound waves to make an image of your heart. You might get other imaging tests as well. For instance, the doctor might ask for a computerized tomography (CT) scan, which takes X-rays from different angles and puts them together to make a more complete picture. Or they might ask for a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. This uses powerful magnets and radio waves to make a detailed image. Your doctor might also take a biopsy . For that, they'll take a small sample of skin to look for signs of abnormal collagen under a microscope. They might also run chemical tests on the sample to try to find out which type of EDS you may have. Other kinds of tests can show which genes might be causing the problem. Treatment Once your doctor knows which form of EDS you have, you can talk about how to manage your symptoms. You might need to see several kinds of doctors, including: An orthopedist, who specializes in joint and skeletal problems A dermatologist, who treats skin conditions A rheumatologist , who deals with diseases that affect connective tissues Some treatment options include: Physical therapy and exercise to build muscle tone and help coordination. Stronger muscles can make you less likely to dislocate a joint. Helpful exercises can include walking, low-impact aerobics, swimming , or bicycling. Physical therapy is especially important for children with EDS. Braces or other assistive devices , like a wheelchair or scooter, to make getting around easier. Calcium and vitamin D supplements to help strengthen your bones. Over-the-counter drugs to help with joint pain. If those don't help, you may need a prescription medication. Women with EDS may need special care if they're pregnant because of possible issues with pain. Living With EDS Some things can help make day-to-day life easier: Use soft-bristled brushes to brush your teeth . Thick pens or pencils can help ease strain on your fingers. Wear protective clothing or pads over your knees and elbows to prevent bruising or cuts. Avoid contact sports and high-impact exercises like running or skiing Also, a therapist, counselor, or support group might help you deal better with the changes in your life."
12,What Is Edema?,"""Edema"" is the medical term for swelling. Body parts swell from injury or inflammation. It can affect a small area or the entire body. Medications, pregnancy, infections, and many other medical problems can cause edema. Edema happens when your small blood vessels leak fluid into nearby tissues. That extra fluid builds up, which makes the tissue swell. It can happen almost anywhere in the body. Types of Edema Peripheral edema. This usually affects the legs, feet, and ankles, but it can also happen in the arms. It could be a sign of problems with your circulatory system, lymph nodes, or kidneys. Pedal edema. This happens when fluid gathers in your feet and lower legs. It’s more common if you’re older or pregnant. It can make it harder to move around in part because you may not have as much feeling in your feet. Lymphedema . This swelling in the arms and legs is most often caused by damage to your lymph nodes, tissues that help filter germs and waste from your body. The damage may be the result of cancer treatments like surgery and radiation. The cancer itself can also block lymph nodes and lead to fluid buildup. Pulmonary edema. When fluid collects in the air sacs in your lungs, you have pulmonary edema. That makes it hard for you to breathe, and it’s worse when you lie down. You may have a fast heartbeat, feel suffocated, and cough up a foamy spittle, sometimes with blood . If it happens suddenly, call 911. Cerebral edema. This is a very serious condition in which fluid builds up in the brain. It can happen if you hit your head hard, if a blood vessel gets blocked or bursts, or you have a tumor or allergic reaction. Macular edema. This happens when fluid builds up in a part of your eye called the macula, which is in the center of the retina, the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. It happens when damaged blood vessels in the retina leak fluid into the area. Causes of Edema Things like a twisted ankle, a bee sting, or a skin infection will cause edema. In some cases, like an infection, this may be helpful. More fluid from your blood vessels puts more infection-fighting white blood cells in the swollen area. Edema can also come from other conditions or from when the balance of substances in your blood is off. For example: Low albumin. Your doctor may call this hypoalbuminemia. Albumin and other proteins in the blood act like sponges to keep fluid in your blood vessels. Low albumin may contribute to edema, but it’s not usually the only cause. Allergic reactions. Edema is a part of most allergic reactions . In response to the allergen, nearby blood vessels leak fluid into the affected area. Obstruction of flow. If drainage of fluid from a part of your body is blocked, fluid can back up. A blood clot in the deep veins of your leg can cause leg edema. A tumor blocking the flow of blood or another fluid called lymph can cause edema. Critical illness. Burns, life-threatening infections, or other critical illnesses can cause a reaction that allows fluid to leak into tissues almost everywhere. This can cause edema all over your body. Congestive heart failure. When the heart weakens and pumps blood less effectively, fluid can slowly build up, creating leg edema. If fluid builds up quickly, you can get fluid in the lungs. If your heart failure is on the right side of your heart, edema can develop in the abdomen. Liver disease. Severe liver disease, such as cirrhosis , causes you to retain fluid. Cirrhosis also leads to low levels of albumin and other proteins in your blood. Fluid leaks into the abdomen and can also cause leg edema. Kidney disease. A kidney condition called nephrotic syndrome can cause severe leg edema and sometimes whole-body edema. Pregnancy. Mild leg edema is common during pregnancy. But serious complications of pregnancy like deep vein thrombosis and preeclampsia can also cause edema. Head trauma , low blood sodium (called hyponatremia), high altitudes, brain tumors, and a block in fluid drainage in the brain (known as hydrocephalus) can cause cerebral edema. So can headaches, confusion, unconsciousness, and coma. Medications. Many medicines can cause edema, including: NSAIDs (such as ibuprofen and naproxen) Calcium channel blockers Corticosteroids (like prednisone and methylprednisolone) Pioglitazone and rosiglitazone Pramipexole When they cause swelling, usually it's mild leg edema . Symptoms of Edema Your symptoms will depend on the amount of swelling you have and where you have it. Edema in a small area from an infection or inflammation (like a mosquito bite) may cause no symptoms. On the other hand, a large allergic reaction (such as from a bee sting) may cause edema on your entire arm that can bring pain and limit your arm's movement. Food allergies and allergic reactions to medicine may cause tongue or throat edema. This can be life-threatening if it interferes with your breathing. Leg edema can make the legs feel heavy. This can affect walking. In edema and heart disease , for example, the legs may easily weigh an extra 5 or 10 pounds each. Severe leg edema can interfere with blood flow, leading to ulcers on the skin. Pulmonary edema causes shortness of breath and sometimes low oxygen levels in the blood. Some people with pulmonary edema may have a cough. There may be an indent or a “pit” that remains for a while after you push on the skin in some types of edema. This is called pitting edema. If the tissue springs back to its normal shape, it’s called non-pitting edema. It’s a symptom that may help your doctor figure out the cause of your edema. Treatment of Edema To treat edema, you often must treat its underlying cause. For example, you might take allergy medications to treat swelling from allergies. Edema from a block in fluid drainage can sometimes be treated by getting the drainage flowing again. A blood clot in the leg is treated with blood thinners. They break down the clot and get drainage back to normal. A tumor that blocks blood or lymph can sometimes be shrunk or removed with surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation. Leg edema related to congestive heart failure or liver disease can be treated with a diuretic (sometimes called a ''water pill'') like furosemide (Lasix). When you can pee more, fluid from the legs can flow back into the blood. Limiting how much sodium you eat can also help."
13,Muscular Dystrophy,"What Is Muscular Dystrophy? Muscular dystrophy (MD) is a group of inherited diseases in which the muscles that control movement (called voluntary muscles) progressively weaken. In some forms of this disease, the heart and other organs are also affected. There are nine major forms of muscular dystrophy: Myotonic Duchenne Becker Limb-girdle Facioscapulohumeral Congenital Oculopharyngeal Distal Emery-Dreifuss Muscular dystrophy can appear in infancy up to middle age or later, and its form and severity are determined in part by the age at which it occurs. Some types of muscular dystrophy typicallyaffect only males; some people with MD enjoy a normal life span with mild symptoms that progress very slowly; others experience swift and severe muscle weakness and wasting, dying in their late teens to early 20s. The various types of MD affect more than 50,000 Americans. Through advances in medical care, children with muscular dystrophy are living longer than ever before. Muscular Dystrophy Symptoms by Type Myotonic (also called MMD or Steinert's disease). The most common form of muscular dystrophy in adults, myotonic muscular dystrophy affects both men and women, and it usually appears any time from early childhood to adulthood. In rare cases, it appears in newborns (congenital MMD). The name refers to a symptom, myotonia -- prolonged spasm or stiffening of muscles after use. This symptom is usually worse in cold temperatures. The disease causes muscle weakness and also affects the central nervous system , heart , gastrointestinal tract, eyes , and hormone-producing glands. In most cases, daily living isn't restricted for many years. Those with myotonic MD have a decreased life expectancy. Duchenne. The most common form of muscular dystrophy in children, Duchenne muscular dystrophy typically affects only males. It appears between the ages of 2 and 6. The muscles decrease in size and grow weaker over time yet may appear larger. Disease progression varies, but many people with Duchenne (1 in 3,500 boys) need a wheelchair by the age of 12. In most cases, the arms, legs, and spine become progressively deformed, and there may be some cognitive impairment. Severe breathing and heart problems mark the later stages of the disease. Those with Duchenne MD usually die in their late teens or early 20s. Becker. This form is similar to Duchenne muscular dystrophy, but the disease is much milder: symptoms appear later and progress more slowly. It usually appears between the ages of 2 and 16 but can appear as late as age 25. Like Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Becker muscular dystrophy typically affects only males (1 in 30,000) and causes heart problems. Disease severity varies. Those with Becker can usually walk into their 30s and live further into adulthood. Limb-girdle. This appears in the teens to early adulthood and affects males and females. In its most common form, Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy causes progressive weakness that begins in the hips and moves to the shoulders, arms, and legs and the heart may be affected. Within 20 years, walking becomes difficult or impossible. Sufferers typically live to middle age to late adulthood. Facioscapulohumeral. Facioscapulohumeral refers to the muscles that move the face, shoulder blade, and upper arm bone . This form of muscular dystrophy appears in the teens to early adulthood and affects males and females. It progresses slowly, with short periods of rapid muscle deterioration and weakness. Severity ranges from very mild to completely disabling. Walking, chewing, swallowing, and speaking problems can occur. About 50% of those with facioscapulohumeral MD can walk throughout their lives, and most live a normal life span. It may also bee associated with seizures, mental health problems, and can involve the heart Congenital. Congenital means present at birth. Congenital muscular dystrophies progress slowly and affect males and females. The two forms that have been identified -- Fukuyama and congenital muscular dystrophy with myosin deficiency -- cause muscle weakness at birth or in the first few months of life, along with severe and early contractures (shortening or shrinking of muscles that causes joint problems). Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy causes abnormalities in the brain and often seizures . Oculopharyngeal. Oculopharyngeal means eye and throat. This form of muscular dystrophy appears in men and women in their 40s, 50s, and 60s. It progresses slowly, causing weakness in the eye and face muscles, which may lead to difficulty swallowing. Weakness in pelvic and shoulder muscles may occur later. Choking and recurrent pneumonia may occur. Distal. This group of rare diseases affects adult men and women. It causes weakness and wasting of the distal muscles (those farthest from the center) of the forearms, hands, lower legs, and feet . It is generally less severe, progresses more slowly, and affects fewer muscles than other forms of muscular dystrophy. Emery-Dreifuss. This rare form of muscular dystrophy appears from childhood to the early teens and affects mainly males. In very rare cases, females can be affected. For that to happen, both of a girls X chromosomes (the one they get from their mother and the one from their father) would have to have the defective gene. It causes muscle weakness and wasting in the shoulders, upper arms, and lower legs. Life-threatening heart problems are common and can also affect carriers -- those who have the genetic information for the disease but do not develop the full-blown version (including mothers and sisters of those with Emery-Dreifuss MD). Muscle shortening (contractures) occurs early in the disease. Weakness can spread to chest and pelvic muscles. The disease progresses slowly and causes less severe muscle weakness than some other forms of muscular dystrophy. Muscular Dystrophy Causes and Risk Factors Muscular dystrophy is caused by defects in certain genes, with type determined by the abnormal gene. In 1986, researchers discovered the gene that, when defective or flawed, causes Duchenne muscular dystrophy. In 1987, the muscle protein associated with this gene was named dystrophin. Duchenne muscular dystrophy occurs when that gene fails to make dystrophin. Becker muscular dystrophy occurs when a different mutation in the same gene results in some dystrophin, but it's either not enough or it's poor in quality. Scientists have discovered and continue to search for the genetic defects that cause other forms of muscular dystrophy. Most of the muscular dystrophies are a form of inherited disease called X-linked disorders or genetic diseases that mothers can transmit to their sons even though the mothers themselves are unaffected by the disease. Men carry one X chromosome and one Y chromosome. Females carry two X chromosomes. Thus, in order for a girl to become affected by muscular dystrophy, both their X chromosomes would have to carry the defective gene -- an extremely rare occurrence, since their mother would have to be a carrier (one defective X chromosome) and their father would have to have muscular dystrophy (since men carry just one X chromosome, the other is a Y chromosome). A female who carries the defective X chromosome can pass the disease to their son (whose other chromosome is a Y, from the father). A few muscular dystrophies aren't inherited at all and occur because of a new gene abnormality or mutation. Muscular Dystrophy Diagnosis To start, your doctor will examine your child and ask questions about medical and family health history. Muscular dystrophy is diagnosed using several different tests. These may include: Muscle biopsy . A small piece of muscle tissue is removed and examined to confirm the diagnosis or rule out another muscle disease. Genetic ( DNA ) testing. Genes passed down through families can cause some forms of muscular dystrophy. A blood test can determine if you or your child has the gene. Neurological tests. Various tests are done to check nervous system function, reflexes, and coordination. One example is a nerve conduction study, also called a nerve function test, or electromyography (EMG). Enzyme tests. These are blood tests that check for proteins, or enzymes, linked to muscle weakness. People with muscular dystrophy have high levels of the enzyme creatine kinase. It’s made when muscles are damaged. They also have higher levels of serum aldolase, which is made when your body breaks down sugar into energy. Heart monitoring. An electrocardiogram may be done to check for an abnormal heartbeat . Some types of muscular dystrophy cause irregular heartbeats. MRI or ultrasound . These imaging tests give the doctor a look at muscle quality and can reveal if fat is replacing muscle tissue. Muscular Dystrophy Treatment There is no cure for muscular dystrophy, but treatments can help manage symptoms and improve quality of life. Medications Prescription drugs are available to control muscular dystrophy symptoms or slow their progression. Medications for muscular dystrophy include: Steroids . Corticosteroids, such as prednisone and deflazacort (Emflaza), are the standard of care for muscular dystrophy. They help improve muscle strength and breathing and decrease weakness. Side effects include high blood pressure and weight gain . People who use steroids for a long time are at risk for brittle bones. Medicines targeting gene mutations. Eteplirsen (Exondys 51) and golodirsen (Vyondys 53) increase the level of the gene dystrophin. They’re approved to specifically treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Anticonvulsants. Often used to treat epilepsy , these antiseizure drugs may also help reduce muscle spasms . Immunosuppressants. These powerful medicines are often used to treat lupus and other autoimmune diseases . When given to people with muscular dystrophy, they may help prevent some muscle cell damage. Antibiotics. The doctor may prescribe an antibiotic to treat a lung infection, which is common in people with muscular dystrophy. Physical therapy Physical therapy helps keep joints and muscles flexible. It’s an important part of a muscular dystrophy treatment plan. The goal of physical therapy is to improve strength in the large muscle groups and prevent scoliosis and contractures. Physical therapy for muscular dystrophy may involve: Range of motion exercises Stretching Low-impact workouts, such as swimming or water exercise (aquatic therapy) Respiratory care Muscle weakness can affect the lungs, making breathing difficult. A respiratory therapist can teach you and your child how to properly use a mask, nose device, or mouthpiece. Mobility and positioning aids Braces, walkers, or wheelchairs help provide mobility and independence to people with muscular dystrophy. Standing with a walker, even for just a little bit each day, boosts blood flow and helps build better bones. Speech therapy Muscle weakness in the face and throat can make speaking difficult. Learning how to properly pace breathing and talking can be helpful. A speech therapist can also show you how to use speech communication devices. Surgery Surgery may be recommended to manage or correct complications of muscular dystrophy. For example, cataract surgery may be done to replace a cloudy eye lens. Or a person with muscular dystrophy may need spinal fusion surgery to treat scoliosis, or heart surgery to implant a pacemaker . Muscular Dystrophy Complications The complications of muscular dystrophy depend on the type. Some types are mild, while others are serious and get worse very fast. Worsening muscle weakness can affect the ability to walk, breathe, swallow, and speak. Complications of muscular dystrophy can include: Breathing problems . Progressive weakness in the breathing muscles (diaphragm) makes it hard to take a breath. That raises the risk for lung infections such as pneumonia. Curving of the spine (scoliosis). Weakness in the muscles supporting the backbone causes the spine to become curved. Most people with Duchenne muscular dystrophy need scoliosis surgery. Heart problems. Some types of muscular dystrophy cause abnormal and dangerous changes in the heartbeat. You need a pacemaker to regulate it. Muscular dystrophy can also cause the heart muscle to become weak ( cardiomyopathy ). That leads to heart failure . Swallowing difficulty. Weakness affects the muscles in the esophagus , and causes problems with chewing and swallowing. This can lead to choking. Some people with muscular dystrophy will need a feeding tube . Shortening of the tendons or muscles around the joints (contractures). Bracing and tendon release surgery can help prevent some contractures. Vision problems. Some types of muscular dystrophy cause clouding of the eye lens ( cataracts ). Need for a wheelchair. Weakness in the large muscles of the legs makes it difficult to walk, stand, kneel, or climb. Some people with muscular dystrophy eventually need to use a wheelchair."
14,What Is Trisomy 18?,"Trisomy 18 Explained Trisomy 18 is a condition caused by a problem in your chromosomes. It's also called Edwards syndrome, after the doctor who first described it. Chromosomes are the threadlike structures in cells that hold genes. Genes carry the instructions needed to make every part of a baby's body. Trisomy 18 is a condition where you have three copies of chromosome 18 in your body's cells instead of two. (Photo Credit: KATERYNA KON/Science Source) When an egg and sperm join and form an embryo, their chromosomes combine. Each baby gets 23 chromosomes from the mother's egg and 23 chromosomes from the father's sperm – 46 in total. Sometimes the mother's egg or the father's sperm contains the wrong number of chromosomes. As the egg and sperm combine, this mistake is passed on to the baby. A ""trisomy"" means that the baby has an extra chromosome in some or all of the body's cells. In the case of trisomy 18, the baby has three copies of chromosome 18. This causes many of the baby's organs to develop in an abnormal way. Types of trisomy 18 There are three types of trisomy 18: Full trisomy 18. The extra chromosome is in every cell in the baby's body. This is by far the most common type of trisomy 18. Partial trisomy 18. The child has only part of an extra chromosome 18. That extra part may be attached to another chromosome in the egg or sperm (called a translocation). This type of trisomy 18 is very rare. Mosaic trisomy 18. The extra chromosome 18 is only in some of the baby's cells. This form of trisomy 18 is also rare. How Common Is Trisomy 18? Trisomy 18 is the second-most common type of trisomy syndrome, after trisomy 21 (Down syndrome). About 1 in every 5,000 babies are born with trisomy 18, and most are female. The condition is even more common than that, but many babies with trisomy 18 don't survive past the second or third trimester of pregnancy . Symptoms of Trisomy 18 Babies with trisomy 18 are often born very small and frail. They typically have many serious health problems and physical defects, including: Cleft palate Clenched fists with overlapping fingers that are hard to straighten Defects of the lungs , kidneys , and stomach / intestines Deformed feet (called ""rocker-bottom feet"" because they're shaped like the bottom of a rocking chair) Feeding problems Heart defects, including a hole between the heart 's upper (atrial septal defect) or lower (ventricular septal defect) chambers Low-set ears Severe developmental delays and mental disabilities Chest deformity Slowed growth Small head ( microcephaly ) Small jaw (micrognathia) Weak cry Risk Factors for Trisomy 18 The risk of having a child with trisomy 18 increases with the age of the mother, though women of any age can have a child with trisomy 18. There isn't anything you can do to lessen your chances of having a child with the condition as it's due to a chromosome disorder. If you've had one baby with trisomy 18, the risk of having another with it is 0.5% to 1%. If you or your partner is a carrier of a chromosome disorder that leads to partial trisomy 18, the risk of having another child with this condition could be as high as 20%. Trisomy 18 Diagnosis The doctor usually will do a screening test using some of the mother's blood. The test can't say for sure if your baby will have trisomy 18, but it can tell if your baby is at risk for it – and for other diseases that come from chromosome errors. To diagnose trisomy 18, your doctor will take cells from the amniotic fluid ( amniocentesis ) or placenta (chorionic villus sampling) and analyze their chromosomes. These tests are done after the screening test because they carry a small risk of miscarriage or early labor. Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) is done in the first trimester, and amniocentesis is done in the second or third trimester. Trisomy 18 ultrasound Around 12 weeks of pregnancy or later, your doctor can do an ultrasound, which will give them a picture of what your fetus looks like. It may tell them if your baby has trisomy 18, but it's usually confirmed by the CVS or amniocentesis. Some of the things a doctor may see on an ultrasound if your baby has trisomy 18 include a smaller size, problems with the intestines, and problems with the limbs, like clenched fists. After birth, the doctor may suspect trisomy 18 based on your child's face and body. A blood sample can be taken to look for the chromosome disorder. The chromosome blood test can also help determine how likely you are to have another baby with trisomy 18. If you're concerned that your baby may be at risk for trisomy 18 because of a past pregnancy, you may want to see a genetic counselor. Treatment for Trisomy 18 There is no cure for trisomy 18. Treatment for trisomy 18 consists of supportive medical care to provide the child with the best quality of life possible. This might include: Surgeries, especially for heart defects Medicines Feeding tubes Breathing tubes Providing comfort care (as opposed to treatments) At one time, babies born with trisomy 18 were not resuscitated at birth because their long-term chances of survival were so low. Now, guidelines have changed, and reviving infants with trisomy 18 is more likely to be done. The Textbook of Neonatal Resuscitation has removed trisomy 18 from the list of diagnoses that it considers ethical to not resuscitate at birth. Trisomy 18 Life Expectancy Because trisomy 18 causes such serious physical defects, many babies with the condition don't survive to birth. About half of babies who are carried full-term are stillborn. Boys with trisomy 18 are more likely to be stillborn than girls. Of those babies who do survive, half die within the first week of life. Fewer than 10% live to reach their first birthday. Children who do live past that milestone often have severe health problems that require a large amount of care. Only a very small number of people with this condition live into their 20s or 30s. Having a child with trisomy 18 can sometimes be emotionally overwhelming, and it's important for parents to get support during this difficult time. Organizations such as the Chromosome 18 Registry & Research Society and the Trisomy 18 Foundation can help. Trisomy 18 and 13 Trisomy 13 is another chromosomal condition. It's sometimes called Patau syndrome, after the doctor who first described it. In this condition, the person has three copies of chromosome 13, instead of two. Most of the time, all the cells in the body have three copies of chromosome 13, but as with trisomy 18, there are rarer types where an extra chromosome 13 gets attached to another chromosome (translocation) or only some of the body cells have the extra copy of chromosome 13 (mosaic trisomy 13). Babies with trisomy 13 generally have severe medical issues and birth defects, including: Heart defects Spinal cord and brain disorders Low-set ears Cleft lip and/or cleft palate Very small or poorly developed eyes ( microphthalmia ) Extra fingers and toes Weak muscle tone (hypotonia) Some organs in the belly bulging through an opening near the umbilical cord Serious mental retardation Trisomy 13 affects 1 in 16,000 babies, though most fetuses with this condition don't survive to the third trimester of pregnancy. Most babies born with this condition die within the first few days or weeks of life, as they have so many medical complications. Just 5% to 10% make it past their first year. Like trisomy 18, no one knows why some babies get this condition. It's known that the chance increases with the mother's age, though women of any age can have a child with trisomy 13. About 80% of babies with trisomy 18 or 13 are born to mothers under 35. The condition can be diagnosed before birth with the same tests used to identify trisomy 18, or after birth by a physical examination. Takeaways Trisomy 18 is a condition where you have three copies of each chromosome 18 in your body's cells instead of two. This can lead to serious physical and mental disabilities. There is no cure, though treatment can include surgeries, medicines, breathing tubes, and feeding tubes. Some parents opt just for comfort care. Life expectancy is usually a year or less. Trisomy 18 FAQs How old is the oldest living person with trisomy 18? The oldest people were reported to be in their early 40s a few years ago. But it's unclear if they are alive today. Are babies with trisomy 18 less active in the womb? Yes, they are often less active."
15,Caring for Your Teeth and Gums,"With proper care, your teeth and gums can stay healthy throughout your life. The healthier your teeth and gums are, the less risk you have for tooth decay and gum disease . How Should I Care for My Teeth and Gums? There are five basic steps to caring for teeth and gums: Brushing Flossing Rinsing Eating right Visiting the dentist To keep your teeth and gums healthy, it's important to have regular check-ups and professional cleanings. You should also see your dentist if you have pain in your teeth, pain in your mouth, or bleeding, swollen gums. Tips for Brushing Teeth Brush at least twice a day. If you can, brush after every meal. Ideally wait 30 minutes after eating; this will allow any enamel that softened from acid during eating to re-harden and not get brushed away. Brushing removes plaque , a film of bacteria that clings to teeth. When bacteria in plaque come into contact with food, they produce acids. These acids lead to cavities . To brush: Place a pea-sized dab of fluoride toothpaste on the head of the toothbrush . (Use a soft toothbrush.) Place the toothbrush against the teeth at a 45-degree angle up to the gum line. Move the brush across the teeth using a small circular motion. Continue with this motion cleaning one tooth at a time. Keep the tips of the bristles against the gum line. Avoid pressing so hard that the bristles lie flat against the teeth. (Only the tips of the toothbrush clean the teeth.) Let the bristles reach into spaces between teeth. Brush across the top of the chewing surfaces of the teeth. Make sure the bristles get into the grooves and crevices. Use the same small circular motion to clean the backside of the upper and lower teeth – the side that faces the tongue . To clean the inside of the bottom front teeth, angle the head in an up-and-down position toward the bottom inside of the mouth and move the toothbrush in a small circle. For the inside of the top front teeth, angle the brush in an up-and-down position with the tip of the head pointing toward the roof of the mouth . Move the toothbrush in a small circle. Give your tongue a few gentle brush strokes, brushing from the back of your tongue forward. Do not scrub. This helps remove bacteria and freshens your breath. After brushing your teeth for 2 to 3 minutes, rinse your mouth with water. Replace your toothbrush with a new one every 3 to 4 months. You can wear down your enamel if you brush too fast and hard. Hold a brush with a soft bristle at about a 45-degree angle to your gums. Then move it back and forth in short, gentle strokes, about the distance of one tooth. Wait for up to an hour after eating sweets or citrus fruits before you brush your teeth. Acidic foods can soften enamel and may make it easier for you to damage it. Tips for Flossing Your Teeth Floss teeth at least once a day. Flossing gets rid of food and plaque between the teeth, where your toothbrush cannot reach. If plaque stays between teeth, it can harden into tartar , which must be removed by a dentist or hygienist. To floss: Remove about an 18-inch strip of floss from the dispenser. Wind the floss around the middle fingers of each hand, leaving a 1-inch section open for flossing. Floss the top teeth first, then the bottom. Place the floss in your mouth and use your index fingers to push the floss between the teeth. Be careful not to push too hard and injure the gums. Move the floss up and down against the tooth and up and around the gum line. The floss should form a C-shape around the tooth as you floss. Floss between each tooth as well as behind the back teeth. Use a clean section of floss as needed, and take up used floss by winding it around the fingers. Tips for Rinsing Your Mouth Mouthwashes do more than just freshen your breath. Rinse with an antiseptic mouthwash at least once a day to kill bacteria that cause plaque and early gum disease . A fluoride rinse can help prevent tooth decay and cavities. Some rinses can do both. It doesn't matter if you rinse before or after you brush. Swish the mouthwash in your mouth for 30 to 60 seconds. Eating Right for Dental Health For good dental health, eat a variety of foods, but minimize those that contain sugars and starches. These foods produce the most acids in the mouth, and the longer they stay in the mouth, the more they can damage the teeth. Hard ""sucking candies"" are especially harmful because they stay in the mouth a long time. Snacking on sugary foods can lead to tooth decay, because most people don't brush after snacks. Starchy snack foods, like potato chips, stick to the teeth. Avoid snacking on: Candies, cookies, cakes, and pie Sugary gum Crackers, breadsticks, and chips Dried fruits and raisins Calcium in food counters acids in your mouth that cause decay. It also helps keep your bones and teeth strong. Milk, cheese, and other dairy products help protect and strengthen enamel. Choose low-fat or fat-free items to help keep calories down. If you don't eat dairy, look for foods with calcium added. Visit Your Dentist Regularly Visit your dentist at least once every 6 months. To keep your teeth and gums healthy, it's important to have regular check-ups and professional cleanings. You should also see your dentist if you have pain in your teeth, pain in your mouth, or bleeding, swollen gums . You can also ask your dentist about dental sealants . A sealant is a material used to coat the top, chewing surfaces of the teeth. This coating protects the tooth from decay and usually lasts a long time, but can only be placed on a tooth without decay. It is usually placed on children’s teeth as they get their permanent teeth. If you have severe heartburn, stomach acids may escape and eventually reach your mouth, where they can erode (damage) enamel. The eating disorder bulimia, in which people vomit food after they eat, is another threat to your enamel. If you have either condition, talk to your doctor about treatment. Beware of Chlorinated Pools When swimming pools aren't chlorinated properly, the water may become too acidic. When that happens, the water can damage teeth that get wet. Check with the recreation center or gym where you swim to make sure the pool's chlorine levels are checked regularly. While swimming , keep your mouth closed so your teeth don’t get wet. Watch Out for Dry Mouth Saliva helps wash away food and bacteria that can lead to cavities. It also fights the effects of acidic foods. Drink water often to keep your mouth clean and moist. If you exercise hard, be sure to rehydrate during and after your workout . Chewing sugarless gum or sucking on sugarless hard candy can also help keep saliva flowing in your mouth. Some medical conditions and medications can cause dry mouth . Talk to your doctor about treatments. Avoid Grinding Your Teeth Some people grind their upper and lower teeth together, especially at night. Over time, it can wear down the enamel. Talk to your dentist if you've got the grinding habit. They may suggest a custom-fitted mouth guard that can protect your teeth."
16,Food Allergies and Your Skin,"A food allergy happens when your immune system responds defensively to a specific food protein that, in reality, is not harmful to the body. The first time you eat the offending food, the immune system responds by creating specific disease-fighting antibodies (called immunoglobulin E or IgE). When you eat the food again, the IgE antibodies spring into action, releasing large amounts of histamine in an effort to expel the ""foreign invader"" from the body. Histamine is a powerful chemical that can affect the respiratory system , gastrointestinal tract, skin , or cardiovascular system. What Are the Symptoms of a Food Allergy? Symptoms of a food allergy may appear almost immediately, or up to two hours after you've eaten the food. Symptoms can include : A tingling sensation of the mouth Swelling of the tongue and throat Hives Skin rash Vomiting , diarrhea, or abdominal cramps Trouble breathing A drop in blood pressure Loss of consciousness Severe reactions -- called anaphylaxis -- can be deadly. Which Foods Most Often Cause Allergic Reactions? There are eight foods that cause over 90% of food allergies in children -- cow's milk, eggs, peanuts, wheat, soy, fish, shellfish, and tree nuts (such as walnuts, pecans, and almonds). In adults, 90% of food allergies are caused by peanuts, tree nuts, fish, and shellfish. How Are Food Allergies Diagnosed? Your doctor may do a radioallergosorbent blood test (RAST) to check the number of antibodies produced by your immune system. Elevated levels of certain types of antibodies can help your doctor identify specific food allergies. The doctor may also perform an allergy skin test, also called a scratch test, to identify the substances that are causing your allergy symptoms . By having you keep  a food diary , your doctor will have a much better starting point to determine the foods that could trigger your allergies . You may be asked to eliminate all potentially allergenic foods and then add them back to your diet one at a time to see if they prompt any reaction. This is called an elimination and challenge diet . How Are Food Allergies Treated? The best way to cope with a food allergy is to strictly avoid the foods that cause a reaction. Mild reactions often will go away without treatment. For rashes , antihistamines may help reduce itching and may also relieve congestion and other symptoms. For more serious reactions, corticosteroids, such as prednisone , will help to reduce swelling. In life-threatening situations, an epinephrine injection can immediately begin to reverse symptoms and is the only effective treatment option. If a doctor has prescribed an auto-injector for you, carry two at all times. How Can I Be Prepared for Food Allergies? Once you and your doctor have determined which foods you should avoid, stay away from them. However, it's important to maintain a healthy, nutritious diet. Ask your doctor to recommend foods that will provide the necessary nutrients . You should also be aware of the ingredients in processed foods. Be sure to read labels. A registered dietitian can help you learn how to read food labels to discover hidden sources of food allergens. Some lotions, hair care products, soaps, and medications can also have food products -- like nuts or milk -- that might trigger allergies. When eating out, call ahead to find out if the staff is trained to deal with food allergies. Be clear with your server about what you need and ask to speak with the manager or chef if you don’t get a good feeling. Order simply-prepared dishes and avoid salad bars or buffets. If you’re prone to allergic reactions, ask your doctor to prescribe an epinephrine injection kit and carry two with you at all times. Let family members and co-workers know what you’re allergic to and how to help if you have a reaction.  If your child is allergic, make an emergency plan with their school and teachers. It can be tricky if you live in a family or roommate situation where one person has an allergy and the others continue to eat the problem food. Here are some tips: Clearly mark food packages and containers with “safe” or “unsafe.” Consider separate shelves in the refrigerator or pantry. Prepare food for the person with allergies first. If possible, have separate sets of utensils and cookware for preparing foods with and without the allergy trigger. Otherwise wash them right away. In between fixing safe and problem foods, thoroughly clean counters and other surfaces where you prepare meals. For some things, like peanuts, you may need to use a spray cleaner or sanitizing wipe as well as dishwashing liquid. Some people with allergies can get a reaction from food proteins released into the air in vapor or steam during cooking. These are rare and usually mild. Make sure a sensitive person stays away from the kitchen during cooking and for 30 minutes after. Wash your hands often while cooking, and before and after you eat. Scrub the table and kitchen counters after your meal."
17,What Is Biliary Atresia?,"Biliary atresia is a rare disease of the bile ducts that affects only infants. Bile ducts are pathways that carry a digestive fluid called bile from the liver to the small intestine. Once there, it breaks down fats and absorbs vitamins. It then filters waste out of the body. With biliary atresia, these ducts swell and become blocked. Bile is trapped in the liver , where it starts to destroy cells. Over time, the liver can be scarred -- a condition called cirrhosis . Once this happens, it can't filter out toxins the way it should. Some babies get it in the womb. But most often, symptoms appear between 2 and 4 weeks after birth. Causes Doctors believe a number of things may trigger biliary atresia, including: Change in a gene Problem with the immune system Problem with the way the liver or bile ducts develop in the womb Toxic substances Viral or bacterial infection after birth It isn't passed down from one family member to another, and babies can't catch it from someone else. Girls who are born prematurely are most at risk. So are Asian and African-American babies. Symptoms If your baby has biliary atresia, one of the first things you'll notice is that their skin and the whites of their eyes look yellow. This is called jaundice . Jaundice is very common among infants, especially in those born before 38 weeks, but it usually goes away in 2 to 3 weeks. Jaundice caused by biliary atresia lasts longer than that. Their abdomen also may swell, they'll have gray or white stools, and their pee will be dark. This happens because their liver can't process bilirubin -- a reddish-brown substance that's made when red blood cells break down. It's what gives poop its brown color. Some babies also might have frequent nosebleeds or intense itching . Diagnosis Many liver conditions have the same symptoms as biliary atresia. To make sure they find the right cause, your child's doctor may test their blood for high levels of bilirubin. They may also do some or all of the following: X-rays: A small amount of radiation creates a picture that's recorded on film or a computer. This checks for an enlarged liver and spleen . Ultrasound : High-frequency sound waves show detailed images of their organs. Liver scans: Special X-rays use chemicals to create an image of their liver and bile ducts. This can show if and where the flow of bile is blocked. Liver biopsy : Their doctor will take a small sample of tissue so it can be looked at under a microscope. This can show if it's likely they have biliary atresia and help rule out other liver problems such as hepatitis . Diagnostic surgery: They'll be given medicine to make them sleep , and their doctor will make a small cut in their stomach area so they can look at their liver and bile ducts. Treatment The most common treatment is the Kasai procedure. It's done if the blocked bile ducts are outside the baby 's liver. During the operation, your baby 's surgeon will replace the blocked bile ducts with part of their intestine. This lets bile drain from their liver through the new ""duct"" and into their intestine. If it's done before your baby is 3 months old, the surgery has about an 80% success rate. If it's not successful, babies usually need a liver transplant within 1 to 2 years. If the blocked bile ducts are inside the liver, medication may help get rid of bile, and vitamin A , D, and E supplements may be prescribed. But a liver transplant probably will be needed. Outlook If a baby has a successful Kasai procedure, they may recover and have a full, active life. But in most cases, they'll need specialized medical care for the rest of their life. Eventually, they may also need a liver transplant."
18,What Is Eisenmenger Syndrome?,"Eisenmenger syndrome occurs as the result of a birth defect you are born with. This particular birth defect is also called a congenital heart abnormality. This birth defect changes the way blood flows through the heart . It means the body doesn’t get enough oxygen. People with this condition have a high risk of heart failure , stroke , and premature death. It’s named for Dr. Victor Eisenmenger, who first identified the condition in 1897. How It Happens Your heart has four chambers -- a left and right atrium and a left and right ventricle. As your heart beats, blood travels from the body into the right atrium, which sends it to the right ventricle. The right ventricle pumps the blood to the lungs , where it picks up oxygen. When that oxygen-carrying blood goes back to the heart, the left atrium takes it in and passes it to the left ventricle, which sends it out to your body. But in people with Eisenmenger syndrome, there’s often a hole between chambers – usually between the left and right ventricle. When that happens: Oxygen-rich blood gets sent back to the lungs instead of flowing out to your body. This raises the blood pressure in your lungs. High blood pressure in the lungs causes blood to back up in the heart and pass through the hole into the left ventricle. The left ventricle sends the backed-up blood (which hasn’t picked up oxygen) out to your body. If that defect isn’t found and corrected early, it can result in more problems, like high blood pressure in your lungs ( pulmonary hypertension ) and heart failure . Of all the people who are born with a heart defect, about 1 in 12 will develop Eisenmenger syndrome. But that rate may be dropping, because doctors are more able to discover and repair those defects early in life. Symptoms In most cases, the symptoms show up before puberty . Sometimes, they can be spotted during infancy or early childhood. These symptoms are easiest to spot: A bluish color to the skin because of lack of oxygen (cyanosis) Wide fingertips and toes ( clubbing ) Shortness of breath Fluid buildup in parts of the body ( edema ) An abnormal heart rhythm Dizziness or headaches Chest pains Swelling in the joints ( gout ) The condition can also affect the body’s production of red blood cells (they carry oxygen), cause blood clotting or excessive bleeding. Diagnosis If your child’s doctor suspects Eisenmenger syndrome, they might refer them to a specialist who deals with heart problems in children and young adults. That specialist will look for: Blue skin Signs of an improper opening between two heart chambers (cardiac shunt) High blood pressure in the lungs that won’t respond to drugs Your doctor will also want to do: Imaging tests like an X-rays, CT scan , or an echocardiogram An electrocardiogram ( EKG or ECG) or a walking test (to measure your heart rate and blood flow) Blood tests (to look for abnormally high or abnormally low red blood cell counts) Cardiac catheterization (for detailed information about the heart) Lung function tests (to measure how much oxygen is getting to your bloodstream) Treatment If those tests point to Eisenmenger syndrome, your doctor will talk with you about a treatment plan. The focus will be on lowering blood pressure in the artery that carries blood to the lungs and getting more oxygen to the body. This can be done in a variety of ways, ranging from drugs to major surgery. The plan might involve taking medicines that: Relax the arteries to improve blood flow Keep your heart beating at a regular rhythm Prevent infections ( antibiotics ) Prevent blood clots ( blood thinners ) Your doctor may also want you to take iron supplements . You might also have blood removed from your body to reduce the number of red blood cells, if you’re overproducing them. You’ll be given fluids to make up for the lost blood. In severe cases, doctors might perform a heart-lung transplant. This is done when the heart and lungs are failing. Obviously, this is a major step that requires a sophisticated hospital and experienced surgeons. Living With Eisenmenger Syndrome People with this disease don’t live as long as others, and there’s a high risk of sudden death. Most people with Eisenmenger syndrome die between their 20s and 50s. But with careful management, people with this condition may live into their 60s. If you have Eisenmenger syndrome, you should make sure you’re following your treatment plan. In addition, doctors recommend several steps: Avoid high altitudes and dehydration . Strenuous sports are out, but exercising may be OK. Ask your doctor. Eat a low-salt diet, and don’t smoke. Ask your doctor about which over-the-counter medicines are safe for you. Get your vaccines and take care of cuts to avoid infections. Avoid hot tubs or saunas. They can cause your blood pressure to drop suddenly. If you’re having surgery or getting dental work done, you’ll want to talk to your doctor about whether you should take antibiotics beforehand. This reduces the risk of an infection that can attack the heart. If you’re a woman with this disease, getting pregnant can put your life and your unborn baby’s life at risk. Doctors will most likely recommend against it. This is a life-changing condition, and facing up to its challenges and emotional toll can be hard. You should talk with your doctor about support groups and other resources that may be available to you and your loved ones."
19,What Is Brittle Bone Disease?,"Brittle bone disease is a lifelong genetic disorder that causes your bones to break very easily, usually without any type of injury, as from a fall. Your doctor may also call it osteogenesis imperfecta. It affects both sexes and all races equally. There is no cure for brittle bone disease, but your doctor can treat it. Causes Brittle bone disease is passed down through families, or inherited. It’s caused by a defect in a gene that is supposed to make a substance called collagen . Collagen is a protein in your body that forms and strengthens bones. If you don’t have enough of it, your bones become very weak and will break easily. Most children with brittle bone disease get this gene from only one parent, but it’s possible to get it from both. Sometimes a child doesn’t inherit the gene from either parent, but the gene mutation develops on its own. Symptoms The main symptom of brittle bone disease is broken bones. They break very easily. Your child may have a bone break during a diaper change, or even when being burped. Someone with the condition may have only a few broken bones in a lifetime, or may have hundreds of them. Sometimes, babies are born with fractures or get them while growing in their mother’s womb. Other times, symptoms don’t appear until the teen years or later. General symptoms of brittle bone disease may be mild or very severe. They include: Broken bones (fractures) Bleeding and easy bruising (frequent nosebleeds or heavy bleeding after an injury) Blue color in the white part of the eyes Bowing of the legs Breathing problems Brittle, discolored teeth Curved spine , called scoliosis Feeling very tired Skin that is easily hurt Hearing loss that starts in early adulthood Can’t stand warm temperatures Loose joints Short height Weak muscles and tissues Doctors group brittle bone disease into types, based on symptoms and number of fractures.The most common types of brittle bone disease are: Mild Few signs of the condition Little to no bone deformity Number of broken bones from a few to many Height not usually affected May have premature hearing loss Broken bones decrease after puberty Average life expectancy Moderate to severe Increased number and frequency of broken bones Babies can be born with many broken bones, an unstable neck, or soft skull Problems with long bones slowly get worse Short height Abnormally shaped spine and rib cage May have a dozen to several hundred broken bones in a lifetime May not be able to move and may need a motorized wheelchair Severe breathing problems can lead to early death Lethal Babies usually die in the womb or soon after birth Severe fractures and breathing problems cause death soon after birth Diagnosis If your baby is born with broken bones, the doctor can diagnose the condition with a physical exam . Your doctor will examine your child and ask questions about your family and medical history. Blood and urine tests will rule out other health conditions that can cause weak bones, such as rickets . Genetic testing can confirm brittle bone disease. Genetic tests can also tell if you or your family members carry the gene. Treatment There is no cure for brittle bone disease, but treatment can relieve symptoms, prevent breakage of bones, and maximize movement. Severe forms of the disease can affect the shape of the rib cage and spine, which can lead to life-threatening breathing problems. Some people may need to be on oxygen. But in many other cases, people with this condition live a healthy, productive life with monitoring on a regular basis and the right treatment. That treatment may include: Splints and casts for broken bones Braces for weak legs, ankles , knees, and wrists Physical therapy to strengthen the body and improve movement Medicine to make the bones stronger Surgery to implant rods in the arms or legs Special dental work, such as crowns, for brittle teeth Other things that could be helpful: Try to maintain a healthy weight . Too much weight adds stress to the bones. Talk to the doctor or physical therapist about a safe exercise routine. Eat a diet rich in vitamin D and calcium . But high doses of these supplements are not recommended. Avoid alcohol , or drink it only occasionally. Cut back on caffeine . Discuss the use of any steroid medications with your doctor. These drugs reduce bone density. Do not smoke. Avoid secondhand smoke ."
20,Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP): An Overview,"What Is a Comprehensive Metabolic Panel? A comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) is a series of 14 blood tests. It gives your doctor a snapshot of how your liver and kidneys are working, your blood sugar (glucose) level, and your electrolyte and fluid balance. A CMP is a standard blood test that measures your blood sugar levels, how your kidneys and liver function, and your electrolyte and fluid levels. (Photo Credits: iStock/Getty Images) The 14 tests include alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), bilirubin, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, sodium, potassium, carbon dioxide, chloride, albumin, total protein, glucose, and calcium . It’s also called a metabolic panel, chem 14, chemistry panel, or chemistry screen. Comprehensive metabolic panel vs. basic metabolic panel The doctor may test you with a basic metabolic panel (BMP) instead of a CMP based on your health history and your needs. A BMP can help your doctor understand how your body is using your food and how the chemicals in your body are balanced. It includes eight of the same tests as a CMP: BUN, creatinine, carbon dioxide, chloride, potassium, sodium, glucose, and calcium. Your doctor may order this instead of a CMP: As part of your regular checkup When you go to the ER When you have some long-term conditions, such as high blood pressure or kidney disease It's also called a chem 7 or electrolyte panel. Why Are Comprehensive Metabolic Panels Done? You may get a CMP as part of your yearly checkup, or you may get it to check for kidney or liver diseases. The doctor might also want one to check you for any medical problems, keep track of any chronic conditions you have, or make sure certain medications aren’t hurting your liver or kidneys . The CMP can tell your doctor: How your kidneys and liver are working How much protein is in your blood Your electrolyte levels The balance of acid and base in your blood Your blood sugar levels Comprehensive Metabolic Panel Tests Most labs do the same tests, but this may vary slightly depending on the lab or what your doctor has asked them to test. Most CMPs include the following 14 tests: CMP liver and protein tests Albumin. It's made in your liver and is the main protein in your blood and carries hormones, vitamins, and enzymes throughout your body. Low levels may be a sign of liver or kidney disease or another medical condition. High levels may be a sign of dehydration. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP). It's a protein made in your liver, bones, kidneys, and digestive system. Abnormal levels of ALP may be a sign of health conditions, such as liver disease, bone disorders, and chronic kidney disease. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT). It's a protein made mostly in the liver. Damaged liver cells release ALT into your blood. High levels in your blood may be a sign of liver injury or disease. You may have high ALT levels in your blood before you have any symptoms, so an ALT test can give your doctor a way of catching some liver diseases early. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST). This protein is made mostly in your liver, but also in some muscles and other organs. Your doctor may use this test to help diagnose or monitor liver damage or disease. Total protein. It refers to the total amount of protein in your blood, which includes albumin and globulin. Globulins are proteins that help fight infections and carry nutrients in your body. Some globulins are made in the liver and others are made by the immune system. Low total protein levels can be a sign of a serious health problem. Bilirubin. It's a yellow chemical your body makes when it breaks down old red blood cells. Your liver usually filters most of the bilirubin out of your blood. If your liver is damaged, bilirubin can leak out. If you have too much bilirubin in your blood, you may get jaundice, when your skin and eyes turn yellow. This test can help your doctor check on how well your liver is working. CMP kidney tests Blood urea nitrogen (BUN). Urea nitrogen is a waste product that your kidneys filter out of your blood. High BUN levels may be a sign that your kidneys aren't working well. You may have high BUN levels in your blood before you have any symptoms of kidney disease, so this test can give your doctor a way of catching some kidney problems early. This test may also be called a urea nitrogen test or serum BUN. Creatinine. It's a normal breakdown product in your body. Your muscles make it when you work them hard. Your kidneys usually filter creatinine out of your blood. High levels of creatinine may be a sign of kidney disease, dehydration, muscle disorders, body injury, muscular dystrophy, or intense exercise. This test may also be called serum creatinine, kidney function, or renal function. The lab often uses this result to calculate an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and also compares it to your BUN. These calculations can help your doctor figure out if you have a serious kidney problem and possibly why you're having it. CMP electrolyte tests Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a breakdown product your body makes when you digest food. You breathe it out of your lungs when you exhale. Most of the CO2 in your blood is bicarbonate, which is an electrolyte. Electrolytes are electrically charged minerals that help you control the amount of fluid in your body as well as your pH balance (balance of acids and bases). High or low levels can be a sign you have an electrolyte imbalance. Diseases that can cause an electrolyte imbalance include high blood pressure and kidney, lung, or liver conditions. Chloride is a type of electrolyte, and abnormal levels can be a sign you have an electrolyte imbalance. High levels may be a sign of dehydration, kidney disease, or acidosis (having too much acid in your blood). Low levels may be a sign of heart failure, lung disease, Addison disease (a condition where your adrenal glands don't make enough of certain hormones), or alkalosis (having too much base in your blood). You may also have abnormal levels of chloride if you are overhydrated, dehydrated, or if you've taken antacids. Potassium is necessary for your cells, nerves, heart, and muscles to work well. High levels may be a sign of kidney disease, Addison disease, or type 1 diabetes. High levels may also be from injury, burns, surgery, or certain medicines, such as diuretics or antibiotics. Low levels may be a sign of adrenal gland disorders (such as Cushing's syndrome and aldosteronism), kidney disease, or alcohol use disorder. It can also be from diuretics, dehydration, or laxatives. Sodium is necessary for your nerves and muscles to work well. High levels may be a sign of dehydration, adrenal gland disorders, kidney problems, and diabetes insipidus (a disorder of your kidneys or pituitary gland that makes you very thirsty so that you drink and pee a lot). Low levels may be a sign of dehydration, kidney diseases, cirrhosis of the liver, heart failure, Addison disease, some brain and lung diseases, and some types of cancer. It can also be from over-the-counter pain medicine or antidepressants. CMP glucose test Glucose is a type of sugar and your body's main source of energy. High levels may be a sign of diabetes or other disorders of your pancreas, hyperthyroidism, or stress from surgery, trauma, or other serious illnesses. If you have diabetes, low levels may be due to too much diabetes medicine, not eating enough, or exercising more than you usually do. If you don't have diabetes, low levels may be a sign of liver or kidney disease, alcohol use disorder, hypothyroidism, or an underactive adrenal or pituitary gland. CMP calcium test Calcium is one of the most important minerals in your body. You need the right amount of calcium in your blood for your nerves, muscles, and heart to work well. Low levels of calcium may be a sign of bone disease, thyroid disease, parathyroid disorders, kidney disease, or other conditions. Comprehensive Metabolic Panel Procedure A health care professional will use a small needle to take a blood sample from a vein in your arm. They’ll collect the blood in test tubes or vials. You may feel a little sting when they put the needle in or pull it out. The whole process usually takes less than 5 minutes. Afterward, you may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle went in, but most symptoms go away quickly. If you’re in the hospital, the doctor may do daily tests. If you aren’t in the hospital, but you have a condition such as diabetes or kidney disease, you may go to the doctor’s office or a clinic every few months for tests. Who performs a comprehensive metabolic panel? Any health care professional who is trained in drawing blood can perform a CMP, but it's usually done by a phlebotomist. Phlebotomists are health care professionals who specialize in drawing blood from adults and children. They collect and prepare your blood so it can be tested in a medical lab. After they draw your blood, they will send it to a lab, where medical lab scientists prepare the samples and use specialized machines to analyze them. Comprehensive metabolic panel fasting You will usually need to fast (avoid eating or drinking) before your test. If so, it's usually for at least 8-12 hours. This is so that any food you have eaten won't interfere with your glucose levels. Your doctor will usually let you know if you need to fast and how long you should fast before your test. Don't exercise before your test because this can affect your results, especially your ALT and AST levels. Also, be ready to tell your doctor about any medicines (including prescription, over-the-counter, and illegal drugs), herbs, vitamins, and supplements you take. Comprehensive Metabolic Panel Results Reference ranges depend on the lab that analyzes your blood tests because different labs use their own equipment. They also have different ways of analyzing your blood. Your doctor will look at all your test results together to see if there are patterns that suggest a medical condition. They will also consider your health history, any medicines you take, and any other factors that may affect your results. Ask your doctor to help you understand what your results mean. Normal comprehensive metabolic panel results General ranges for normal results are as follows: Albumin: 3.4-5.4 grams/deciliter (34 to 54 grams/liter) ALP: 20-130 units/liter ALT: 4-36 units/liter AST: 8-33 units/liter Total protein: 6.0-8.3 grams/deciliter (60 to 83 grams/liter) Bilirubin: 0.1-1.2 milligrams/deciliter (2 to 21 micromoles/liter) BUN: 6-20 milligrams/deciliter (2.14 to 7.14 millimoles/liter) Creatinine: 0.6-1.3 milligrams/deciliter (53 to 114.9 micromoles/liter) CO2 (carbon dioxide): 23-29 milliequivalents/liter (23 to 29 millimoles/liter) Chloride: 96-106 milliequivalents/liter (96 to 106 millimoles/liter) Potassium: 3.7-5.2 milliequivalents/liter (3.70 to 5.20 millimoles/liter) Sodium: 135-145 milliequivalents/liter (135 to 145 millimoles/liter) Glucose: 70-100 milligrams/deciliters (3.9 to 5.6 millimoles/liter) Calcium: 8.5-10.2 milligrams/deciliter (2.13 to 2.55 millimoles/liter) But always go by the ranges that are on your report because that’s what your doctor will use. Abnormal comprehensive metabolic panel results If any of your results are not what they should be, your doctor might ask you to come back for more tests. This will help your doctor figure out if there’s a true problem. A lot of things can affect your CMP results, such as: Medications you take, such as steroids , insulin , and hormones Eating or drinking before the test Exercising before the test Blood cell damage that may happen while your blood is collected or when the sample is prepared for analysis Ask your doctor about any abnormal results because they can help you understand what your results mean. Takeaways A comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) is a test that measures 14 different chemicals in a sample of your blood. It gives your doctor an idea of how well your liver and kidneys are working, how much protein and electrolytes you have, your acid-base balance, and your blood sugar levels. Many people get a CMP during their routine checkup, but your doctor may also use it to keep track of how well your medicines are working or to check for kidney or liver diseases. You usually need to fast for the test, but your doctor will let you know if you do. Abnormal results don't always mean you have a medical condition because lots of things can affect your results. Ask your doctor to go through your results with you so you can understand what your results mean for your body."
21,Elephantiasis: What to Know,"Elephantiasis , also known as lymphatic filariasis , is a very rare condition that’s spread by mosquitoes . The common name is often used because if you have it, your arms and legs can swell and become much bigger than they should be. Your sex organs and breasts may also swell up. The affected skin can thicken and harden to look something like an elephant’s skin. It’s more common in tropical or subtropical areas. If you have it, there are medicines and treatments to help with the swelling and discomfort. Causes Usually, to get elephantiasis, you would have to be bitten by a lot of mosquitoes over a long time, in a country where certain types of roundworms are known to exist. It starts when mosquitoes infected with the roundworm larvae bite you. The tiny larvae survive in your bloodstream and grow. They finish maturing in your lymph system . They can live there for years and cause a lot of damage to your lymph system. This is what causes the swelling. Symptoms You may not know you have elephantiasis until you notice the swelling. Not only will those body parts begin to look bulky and lumpy with stiff, tough skin, there is also pain in the swollen area. You may also have chills, fever, and just feel bad all over. Diagnosis Your doctor can find out if you have elephantiasis by giving you a physical exam . They will ask about your medical history, and whether you’ve traveled to a place where you were more likely to have gotten elephantiasis. They also will have blood tests done to see if roundworms are in your bloodstream. These tests need to be done at night, because that’s when these parasites are active. Treatment There are medicines to treat elephantiasis. Your doctor may give you one called diethylcarbamazine (DEC). You’ll take it once a year. It will kill the microscopic worms in your bloodstream. Another way to treat elephantiasis is to use DEC in combination with a medicine called ivermectin . This is also taken once a year, and the combination has shown better long-term results. If you have elephantiasis symptoms, there are some things you can do on your own to ease them: Wash and dry the swollen areas daily. Use moisturizers. Check for wounds and use medicated cream on any sore spots. Exercise , and walk when possible. If your arms or legs are swollen, keep them elevated when you’re lying down or seated. You may also be able to wrap the affected areas tightly to prevent them from getting worse, but you should check with your doctor before doing this. Sometimes, surgery may be needed to relieve pressure in very swollen areas, like the scrotum. Living With Elephantiasis Elephantiasis can be disabling. Sometimes it’s hard to move the affected body parts, which means it could be difficult to work. It might even be hard to get around in your home. You might also worry about how your condition looks to other people. This can cause anxiety and depression . If you have elephantiasis and want information about support groups, ask your doctor. You can also go online to find resources that might help."
22,What Is a Pulmonary Embolism?,"Your blood goes from your heart to your lungs through your pulmonary artery . In the lungs, the blood is supplied with oxygen, and then it goes back to the heart, which pumps the oxygen-rich blood to the rest of your body. When a blood clot gets caught in one of the arteries that go from the heart to the lungs, it’s called a pulmonary embolism (PE). The clot blocks the normal flow of blood. This blockage can cause serious problems, like damage to your lungs and low oxygen levels in your blood. The lack of oxygen can harm other organs in your body, too. If the clot is big or the artery is clogged by many smaller clots, a pulmonary embolism can be deadly. Pulmonary embolisms usually travel to the lungs from a deep vein in the legs. Doctors call this deep vein thrombosis (DVT). These clots develop when the blood can’t flow freely through the legs because your body is still for a long time, say during a long flight or drive. It might also happen if you’re on bed rest after surgery or illness. What Else Could Raise My Chances of Having a PE? The risk factors are the same as those for DVT . Doctors refer to these as Virchow’s triad. They are: Not moving for a long time or having changes in normal blood flow. This often happens if you’ve been in the hospital or on bed rest for a long period of time. It could also happen during a long flight or vehicle ride. Blood that’s more likely to clot. Doctors call this hypercoagulability. It could be caused by medications , like birth control pills . Smoking , cancer , recent surgery, or pregnancy can also put you at risk. Damage to a blood vessel wall. Injury to your lower leg can lead to this. In rare cases, an artery in the lung can be blocked by something other than a clot, like an air bubble or part of a tumor. If you break a big bone , fat from the bone marrow can sometimes come through the blood and cause blockage. How Can I Prevent a Pulmonary Embolism? The best way to prevent a PE is to try to stop blood clots from forming deep in your veins. This can be challenging if you’ve been on bed rest after a surgery or illness, or if you just took a long flight. If you’re at risk, here are a few things that may help lower your chances of getting these dangerous blood clots: Blood thinners Doctors call these anticoagulants . They keep your blood from forming clots. Your doctor may prescribe them to you while you’re in the hospital for surgery. They might also suggest that you keep taking them for some time after you go home. Your doctor might also recommend blood thinners if you’ve been hospitalized after a stroke or heart attack , or if you have complications from cancer. Compression stockings These are long socks that squeeze your legs. The extra pressure helps blood move through your veins and leg muscles. Your doctor may recommend that you wear them for a while after surgery. Exercise Get out of bed and walk when you’re getting over a long stay in the hospital or an illness that’s kept you in bed for too long. It’ll keep the blood in your legs flowing so it doesn’t have a chance to pool. Stretching during trips If you’re on a long flight, try to walk around every few hours. If you can’t stand up, flex your ankles by pulling your toes toward you. Here’s another stretch you can try to do while seated: Pull your leg up toward your chest with one hand . Hold the bottom of that leg with the other hand. Keep this pose for 15 seconds, and then try it with the other leg. Do this up to 10 times per hour. If you’re driving a long distance, stop every hour and stretch your legs. Also, be sure to drink extra fluids to help you stay hydrated. Lifestyle changes Other steps you can take include: Maintain a healthy weight . If you plan to take hormones, like birth control or replacement therapy, talk to your doctor about your risk for blood clots. If you have other health issues, like diabetes or heart failure , take your meds, watch what you eat, and talk to your doctor about any changes. Also talk to your doctor if you have a history of kidney disease or certain autoimmune diseases , or a family history of blood clots If you smoke, quit. In life-threatening cases of pulmonary embolism, your doctor may decide to give you drugs called thrombolytics to break up the clot. It may even need to be taken out or broken up with surgery, though this is rare."
23,Hands-Only CPR for Adults,"Call 911 if a person: Collapses Becomes unresponsive 1. Check Responsiveness Tap the person's shoulder and shout, ""Are you OK?"" Look for normal breathing. Call 911 if there is no response. Start Hands-Only CPR. Hands-Only CPR should not be used for adults whose cardiac arrest is due to drug overdose, near-drowning, or an unwitnessed cardiac arrest. In these cases, do a conventional CPR combination of chest compressions and rescue breathing. Note: For hands-only CPR instructions, watch this video from the American Heart Association. 2. Do Chest Compressions Place the heel of your hand on the center of the person's chest. Place the heel of your other hand on top of your first hand, lacing fingers together. Keep arms straight and your shoulders directly over your hands. Push hard and fast, compressing chest at least 2 inches. Let chest rise completely before pushing down again. Compress at least 100 times per minute. 3. Stop Only if: The person starts breathing normally. A trained responder or emergency help takes over. You are too exhausted to continue. There is an automated external defibrillator (AED) to use. 4. Use an AED as Soon as One Is Available Turn on the AED. It will give you step-by-step instructions. Wipe chest dry. Attach the pads. Plug in connector, if needed. Make sure no one is touching the person. Say ""Clear"" so that people know to stay back and not touch the person. Push the ""Analyze"" button if necessary. If a shock is advised, push the ""Shock"" button. Resume compressions and follow AED prompts."
24,COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease),"What Is COPD? Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a long-term lung condition that makes it hard for you to breathe. Types of COPD COPD is an umbrella term used when you have one or more of these conditions: Emphysema. This results from damage to your lungs’ air sacs (alveoli) that destroys the walls inside them and causes them to merge into one giant air sac. It can’t absorb oxygen as well, so you get less oxygen in your blood. Damaged alveoli can make your lungs stretch out and lose their springiness. Air gets trapped in your lungs and you can’t breathe it out, so you feel short of breath. Chronic bronchitis. If you have coughing, shortness of breath, and mucus that lingers at least 3 months for 2 years in a row, you have chronic bronchitis. Hair-like fibers called cilia line your bronchial tubes and help move mucus out. When you have chronic bronchitis, you lose your cilia. This makes it harder to get rid of mucus, which makes you cough more, which creates more mucus. Refractory asthma. This type may also be called nonreversible. It doesn’t respond to normal asthma medications. COPD Causes and Risk Factors Long-term exposure to things that irritate your lungs is the most common cause. In the U.S., that’s cigarette, pipe, or other types of tobacco smoke. If you hang around other smokers and breathe in a lot of secondhand smoke , that can play a role, too. Your odds also go up if you smoke and have asthma. If you smoke and have COPD, it tends to get worse faster. You might also develop this condition if you’ve been exposed to things like dust, air pollution, or certain chemicals for long periods of time. Your age can make COPD more likely. It develops slowly over the years, so most people are at least 40 when symptoms begin. It’s rare, but your genes could put you at risk for COPD. If you lack a protein called alpha 1 antitrypsin (AAT), you may be more likely to get it. What Are the Symptoms? At first, you might not have any symptoms. But as the disease gets worse, you might notice these common signs of COPD: A cough that doesn't go away Coughing up lots of mucus Shortness of breath, especially when you’re physically active Wheezing or squeaking when you breathe Tightness in your chest Frequent colds or flu Blue fingernails Low energy Losing weight without trying (in later stages) Swollen ankles, feet, or legs COPD Diagnosis and Tests Your doctor will ask about your symptoms, your medical history, and whether you smoke or have been exposed to chemicals, dust, or smoke at work. They’ll also do a physical exam and breathing tests. Let them know if you have an ongoing cough. The most common test is called spirometry. You’ll breathe into a large, flexible tube that’s connected to a machine called a spirometer. It’ll measure how much air your lungs can hold and how fast you can blow air out of them. Your doctor may order other tests to rule out other lung problems, such as asthma or heart failure. These might include: More lung function tests Chest X-rays that can help rule out emphysema, other lung problems, or heart failure CT scan, which uses several X-rays to create a detailed picture of your lungs and can tell the doctor if you need surgery or if you have lung cancer Arterial blood gas test, which measures how well your lungs are bringing in oxygen and taking out carbon dioxide Laboratory tests to determine the cause of your symptoms or rule out other conditions, like the genetic disorder alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency What Are the Treatments for COPD? There’s no cure, so the goal of treatment is to ease your symptoms and slow the disease. Your doctor will also want to prevent or treat any complications and improve your overall quality of life. One of the best things you can do to stop your COPD from getting worse is to stop smoking . Talk to your doctor about different things you can try. Medical treatment Your plan may include: Bronchodilators. You inhale these medicines. They help open your airways. Corticosteroids. These drugs reduce airway inflammation. You could inhale them or take them as pills. Combination inhalers. These inhalers pair steroids with one or more bronchodilators. Antibiotics. Your doctor might prescribe these to fight bacterial infections. Roflumilast (Daliresp). This drug stops an enzyme called PDE4. It prevents flare-ups in people whose COPD is linked to chronic bronchitis. Flu or pneumonia vaccines. These vaccines lower your risk for respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19. Pulmonary rehabilitation. This program includes exercise, disease management, and counseling to help you stay as healthy and active as possible. Oxygen therapy . You may need this to reduce shortness of breath, protect your organs, and enhance your quality of life. Surgery In severe cases of COPD, your doctor may suggest: Bullectomy. Removes bullae, large air spaces that form when air sacs collapse Lung volume reduction surgery. Removes diseased lung tissue Lung transplant. Replaces a diseased lung with a healthy one Complications of COPD COPD can cause many other health problems, like: Respiratory infections. COPD can raise your chances of getting colds, the flu, and pneumonia. They make it harder for you to breathe and could cause more lung damage. A yearly flu shot and vaccinations against pneumonia can help. Heart problems. Doctors aren’t sure why, but COPD can raise your risk of heart disease, including heart attack. Quitting smoking may lower the odds. Lung cancer. People with COPD are more likely to get lung cancer. Quitting smoking can help. High blood pressure in lung arteries. COPD may raise blood pressure in the arteries that bring blood to your lungs. Your doctor will call this pulmonary hypertension . Depression. Trouble breathing can stop you from doing things you like. And living with a chronic illness can lead to depression. Your doctor can help if you feel sad, helpless, or think that you may be depressed. Living With COPD Though there’s no cure, there are things you can do to stay healthy and ease your symptoms. Try taking these steps to enhance your quality of life: If you smoke, stop. Avoid smoke, fumes, dust, and air pollution as much as you can. Take your medications as directed. Get regular checkups. Do breathing exercises. Walk or do other light exercise several times a week. Eat a healthy diet . Try controlled coughing, lots of water, and using a humidifier to help clear your lungs. Get emotional support through counseling or a support group. Control Your Flares There may be times when your symptoms get worse for days or weeks. You might notice you’re coughing more with more mucus, or you have more trouble breathing . Your doctor will call this an acute exacerbation. If you don’t treat it, it could lead to lung failure. Medications, like antibiotics or steroids, can help, and so can oxygen treatments. You might need to go to the hospital. When you’re better, your doctor will tell you how to prevent flares: Quit smoking. Take inhaled steroids , long-acting bronchodilators, or other medications. Get yearly flu and pneumonia vaccines. Avoid air pollution when you can. Track Your COPD Diet and Treatments You can improve life with COPD by taking part in the management of your condition. One way to help your doctor is to monitor your COPD symptoms, diet, and exercise daily. Keeping a daily written log may help you recognize a COPD exacerbation when it begins. With a log, you’re more likely to notice when COPD symptoms suddenly get worse. This may allow you to seek medical treatment early, when it’s most effective, and might keep you from having to go to the hospital. It is also important to follow a healthy, balanced diet to prevent being overweight , which can make shortness of breath worse, or underweight, which is linked to a poorer outcome. Your doctor or a nutritionist can suggest healthy food choices for you. Use your log to track these things each day: Symptoms, such as cough, shortness of breath, increases in mucus, and fatigue Medications and dosages Diet Exercise and other physical activity When Should I Call 911? Get medical help right away if any of these things happen: You have severe shortness of breath. You can't walk or talk. Your heart beats very fast or has an uneven beat. Your lips or fingernails turn blue. You breathe fast and hard, even when taking medicines."
25,What Is Empty Sella Syndrome?,"Within your skull, there’s a small, bony nook at the base of your brain that holds and protects your pituitary gland (which controls how hormones work in your body). This tiny structure is called the sella turcica. In a small number of people, the sella turcica is shaped in such a way that spinal fluid can leak into it. The buildup of spinal fluid squashes the pituitary gland flat, so it looks like your sella turcica is empty. This condition is known as primary empty sella syndrome (ESS) and can also be seen in pseudotumor cerebrii . Your pituitary gland also can be flattened or small because you’ve had surgery or radiation for a tumor or a serious head injury . This is called secondary ESS . Neither type affects your overall health, and both are rare. Doctors usually only find ESS when they’re looking for the cause of other problems. Women are more likely to have ESS than men. It’s also more common among people who are obese or have high blood pressure . Symptoms Most people who have ESS don’t have any signs of it. Some doctors think that fewer than 1% of people who have it have symptoms or problems because of it. When people do have symptoms, these are the most common: Headaches High blood pressure Fatigue Impotence (in men) Low sex drive No menstrual periods or irregular ones (in women) Infertility Less common ones can include: A feeling of pressure inside your skull Spinal fluid leaking from your nose Swelling in your eyes Blurry vision Diagnosis If you have symptoms of ESS, your doctor will ask about your medical history and recommend an imaging test of your brain to see if your sella turcica looks empty. These scans might include: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan: This uses powerful magnets and radio waves to make detailed pictures of the inside of your brain . Computerized tomography (CT) scan: Your doctor will take X-rays of your head from several angles and put them together to make a more complete picture. Treatment If you have ESS but it’s not causing any issues for you, you probably won’t need treatment. If you do have symptoms, your doctor may offer: Medicine. If your pituitary gland isn’t putting out the right amounts of hormones, your doctor may give you drugs to help fix that. Surgery. If spinal fluid is leaking from your nose, a doctor may do surgery to keep that from happening."
26,Understanding Encephalitis: The Basics,"What Is Encephalitis? Encephalitis (pronounced en-sef-uh- lie -tis) is inflammation of your brain tissue. It can be very serious and may cause personality changes, seizures , weakness, and other symptoms, depending on the part of your brain affected. Encephalitis is an inflammation in your brain. Most cases are caused by infection with a virus, such as the herpes simplex virus. (Photo Credit: Science Photo Library/Getty Images) Encephalitis is rare, affecting about 10-15 in 100,000 people each year in the U.S. Young children, older adults, and those with a weak immune system are most vulnerable. It's usually caused by an infection with viruses, bacteria, fungi, or parasites, although it can be caused by an autoimmune condition or some medicines as well. Most people who have mild encephalitis fully recover. Your treatment and chance of recovery depend on the cause and severity of your inflammation. In acute encephalitis, the infection directly affects your brain cells. In parainfectious encephalitis, your brain and spinal cord become inflamed within 1-2 weeks of contracting an infection (usually viral or bacterial) . Encephalitis vs. meningitis Encephalitis and meningitis are both diseases that cause inflammation in your brain. However, while encephalitis is an inflammation of your brain tissue, meningitis is an inflammation of the membranes that cover your brain and spinal cord (called meninges). Like encephalitis, meningitis is often caused by a viral or bacterial infection, but it can also be caused by fungal or parasitic infections, injuries, certain drugs, and some types of cancer. Is encephalitis contagious? Swelling in your brain isn’t contagious, but the causes can be. For example, viral encephalitis can be caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV) that can pass from person to person. Childhood diseases, such as measles, mumps, and German measles (Rubella), used to be a common cause of viral encephalitis in kids, but these causes are a bit rarer now since most people get vaccinated against them before they start school. Encephalitis Causes Viral infections with any of the following three groups of viruses are the most common cause of encephalitis. These include: Herpes viruses, which include HSV (especially HSV-1), chickenpox, cytomegalovirus, and Epstein-Barr virus Viruses that are transmitted through bugbites, such as West Nile virus , Dengue virus, and Eastern equine encephalitis virus Viruses that cause childhood infections, such as measles, mumps, and Rubella Less commonly, encephalitis may be caused by: Infection with HIV or the virus that causes rabies Bacterial and other infections, such as syphilis or toxoplasmosis (an infection with a parasite from infected cat poop) Autoimmune conditions Some kinds of cancer Some medicines Sometimes, your doctor may not be able to tell what caused your encephalitis. Encephalitis Types Infectious encephalitis It is usually caused by a viral infection but can also be caused by bacteria, fungi, and parasites. As it's usually caused by viral infections, it's more common in people who are exposed to bugs that can transmit diseases, such as people who spend a lot of time outdoors, especially near standing water. Infectious encephalitis can develop quickly and the symptoms can be serious. Autoimmune encephalitis It is usually caused by proteins that your body makes in your brain. These proteins cause inflammation in your brain. Doctors don't yet know for sure why some people develop these proteins, while other people don't. Autoimmune encephalitis tends to develop more slowly than infectious encephalitis and may cause more neurological symptoms, such as confusion, memory issues, and seizures. It's also rarer than infectious encephalitis. Some conditions that are linked to autoimmune encephalitis include: Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis Hashimoto’s encephalopathy LGI1/CASPR2-antibody encephalitis Limbic encephalitis Rasmussen’s encephalitis Both infectious and autoimmune encephalitis can cause serious, life-threatening symptoms. If you or someone else has neurological symptoms, such as irritability, seizures, or extreme drowsiness, call 911 or go to the emergency room right away. Encephalitis Symptoms Your symptoms depend on the type of encephalitis you have. People with infectious encephalitis may have symptoms of an infection before they get encephalitis. Signs of encephalitis can include: Fatigue or loss of energy Fever, especially a high fever Headache that can be severe Sensitivity to light and sound Mild-to-moderate neck stiffness Drowsiness or loss of consciousness Irritability, anxiety, and behavioral or personality changes Hallucinations Signs of severe encephalitis may include: Weakness or trouble moving some parts of your body Double vision Confusion, trouble speaking, or difficulty understanding when someone talks to you Coma Seizures A bulging soft spot (fontanel) in infants Go to the ER or call 911 right away if you or someone else has any signs of severe encephalitis. Encephalitis Diagnosis Your doctor will ask about your symptoms, including how long you've had them. Because people with encephalitis can be disoriented, family and friends are key to getting a good history. It's important to know if you've come into contact with mosquitoes or ticks , infected animals, or sick people. Your doctor will also do a physical exam and may order some tests. Encephalitis tests Some of the tests your doctor may use include: Blood tests, including a complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel Urine, stool, or sputum culture tests to see if you have an infection and what type you have Imaging tests, such as CT scans, MRI scans, and magnetoencephalography (MEG) to see where in your brain you are having seizures Electroencephalogram (EEG) to look for seizers or specific electrical activity in your brain Spinal tap (lumbar puncture) to remove cerebrospinal fluid to find infections in your brain or spinal cord A neurological exam, which is a series of tests that show how well your nervous system is working An intracranial pressure monitoring (ICP) to measure the pressure inside your skull Rarely, a biopsy of your brain tissue to look at under a microscope Encephalitis Risk Factors Several risk factors could increase your chance of getting encephalitis. These include: Age. Young children and older adults are at a higher risk for viral encephalitis. Some types of autoimmune encephalitis are more common in children and young adults. Having a weakened immune system. This could be because you have HIV, take medicines for cancer, or have a condition such as diabetes. Having an autoimmune condition. Smoking. Living in areas where mosquito- or tick-borne viruses spread easily, particularly in the summer months. Encephalitis Treatment Because the complications from encephalitis can be serious, you may need to go to the hospital. You will usually need monitoring for your blood pressure, heart rate, and breathing. You will also usually need IV fluid therapy to help keep your brain from swelling more. Otherwise, your treatment will depend on your age, condition, and the cause of your disease. Some common treatments include: Steroids that can help reduce swelling in your brain Antiviral drugs, such as acyclovir (Zovirax), Foscarnet (Foscavir), or Ganciclovir (Cytovene) for people who have viral encephalitis Antibiotics for people with bacterial encephalitis Anticonvulsant therapy for people with seizures Immune globulin and plasmapheresis for people with autoimmune encephalitis Over-the-counter medicines, such as acetaminophen, that can help control fever and headaches Supportive care Supportive care is a type of care for patients who are seriously ill. The goal is to focus your treatment on what is most important to you. This may involve, for instance, focusing on relieving your symptoms and how other treatments will affect how you feel. You usually get supportive care alongside specific treatments for your condition. Examples of supportive care may include: Use of a ventilator or other breathing help, such as an oxygen mask IV fluids to keep you hydrated Medications for pain, inflammation, infection, seizures, and other issues Post encephalitis therapy Once you have been treated for encephalopathy and the inflammation is gone, you may still need some treatment and support to continue your recovery. Some people need help such as: Physical therapy to help regain your muscle strength to stand, walk, or perform regular tasks. Occupational therapy (OT), which often works hand in hand with physical therapy. OT helps you work on your everyday skills and may give you ideas for adaptations, such as special tools, if you need help with some of your day-to-day activities. Speech therapy, which helps you regain or fine-tune your ability to speak or communicate clearly. Brain rehabilitation or retraining, which helps you improve your memory and your cognition. Psychotherapy, which helps you learn how to cope with changes in your life and manage your moods and behavior. Encephalitis Complications After you recover from the swelling in your brain, from encephalitis, you may have long-term damage in your brain that needs ongoing medical care. For instance, some people may have long-term problems, such as: Memory loss (amnesia) Personality and behavioral changes Emotional and psychological problems, such as anxiety, depression, and mood swings Problems with attention, concentration, planning, and problem-solving Repeated seizures (epilepsy) Hearing loss Speech and language problems Problems swallowing Problems with balance, coordination, and movement Long-term fatigue In severe cases, loss of consciousness (coma) and death Encephalitis Prevention The best way to avoid getting encephalitis is to avoid the germs that can cause it. Here are some tips: Get yourself and your kids vaccinated, as recommended by your doctors. The elimination of smallpox and the availability of vaccines that prevent mumps , measles , and rubella have lowered cases of encephalitis , especially in children. If you're traveling in an area that has a high risk of tick-borne or mosquito-borne viruses, make sure you get vaccinated before you head out. The CDC's website has a travelers' health page where you can look up your destination and get a list of all the recommended vaccines for that location. Wash your hands completely and often with soap and water throughout your day, especially before you handle food, eat or drink, and after using the bathroom. Don't share food, eating utensils, or glasses. Don't share personal-care items and remind your kids not to share their things, such as razors, towels, makeup, or toothbrushes. Take these steps to avoid getting bitten by mosquitoes and ticks: Avoid being outside between dusk and dawn when mosquitoes are most likely to bite you. If do have to be out then, wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants. Make sure mosquitoes can't get into your house through broken screens and windows. Also, run a fan, which can keep mosquitos moving around so they're less likely to land on and bite you. Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants when you're in wooded areas with tall grasses and shrubs, where ticks like to hang out. Check yourself, your kids, and your pets for ticks when they come inside during tick season (this can be year-round for people in the U.S. South and on the West Coast, but for most of the U.S., it's early spring to winter). Use bug repellent and insecticide. You can use the mosquito repellent DEET on both your skin and clothes. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recommends spraying your clothes, tents, and outdoor gear with products that contain permethrin to repel and kill both mosquitoes and ticks. Don't spray permethrin on your skin, though. For infants younger than 2 months, you can't use insect repellent, so cover their carrier or stroller with mosquito netting. For infants and children older than 2 months old, you can use 10%-30% DEET products. Don't use a combined sunscreen and DEET product because you'll need to reapply sunscreen for a full day of outside play. Reapplying a DEET-containing product can expose your child to high levels of DEET. Get rid of standing water outside your house. Mosquitoes lay their eggs in standing water. Common problem areas for standing water are old flowerpots, flat roofs, old tires, and clogged gutters. Report any sick or dying birds or small animals to your local health department. They could be infected with viruses such as West Nile virus that cause encephalitis. Encephalitis Prognosis Your symptoms can last anywhere from a few days to a couple of months. Some people with complications may take another few months to fully recover. However, with treatment, most people recover from encephalitis. Your outlook depends on a few things, such as: What caused your encephalitis. Some causes, such as an HSV infection, may cause fewer issues, so people with encephalitis caused by HSV may have an easier recovery than other people. Your level of inflammation. High levels of brain inflammation can cause more long-term issues that complicate your recovery. Your age. Adults may have a harder time recovering from encephalitis. Your overall health. If you have preexisting health issues or a weakened immune system, it can make your recovery more difficult. How long it took you to be diagnosed. The longer it takes you to get treatment, the higher your chance of having a difficult recovery and lasting complications. Takeaways Encephalitis is a condition that involves inflammation and swelling in your brain. It's usually caused by infection with a virus, especially HSV. It isn’t always preventable, but you can lower your risk by avoiding infection with a germ that could lead to encephalitis. This means getting your recommended vaccines and avoiding or protecting yourself when in areas that have ticks and mosquitoes. If you have signs or symptoms of encephalitis, you should get to the doctor right away. Quick diagnosis and treatment can make your recovery easier and limit lasting effects. Although some people do experience complications, most people fully recover. Encephalitis FAQs What is the life expectancy of people with encephalitis? Most people fully recover from encephalitis and go on to live a normal life. People with mild cases may recover in a week, while people with serious cases may have complications that take months of added recovery time. One study showed that about 5% of people who are hospitalized with encephalitis die while they are in the hospital. Can encephalitis resolve on its own? If you have mild encephalitis, it can recover on its own over several weeks. Severe cases of encephalitis, however, can be life-threatening. You can't necessarily tell from your symptoms how serious your case is, so if you suspect you have encephalitis, you need to go to the doctor."
27,Port-Wine Stain Birthmarks,"Port-wine stains are birthmarks that look like someone spilled wine on the skin . About 3 out of every 1,000 children are born with this pink-to-reddish mark. You'll see port-wine stains most often on faces, heads, arms, or legs. But they can appear anywhere on the body. These red marks are rarely harmful, and they usually aren't signs of any major health problem. The biggest concern is often whether a port-wine birthmark will upset a child or hurt their self-confidence, especially when they're a teenager. Port-wine Stain on Infant. Port-wine stains are permanent and often unsightly types of birthmarks which show up at or soon after birth. They are caused by an abnormal distribution of blood vessels called haemangiomas. They are harmless but can be a cause of embarrassment for some depending on the size or location. .They can be lightened by multiple laser surgeries. What Causes Port-Wine Stains Port-wine stains are a kind of vascular birthmark, meaning that they're related to the skin's blood vessels. These birthmarks, including port-wine stains, are not caused by anything the mother does or doesn't do before or during their pregnancy. You can't prevent them. A port-wine stain happens when chemical signals in tiny blood vessels don't ""turn off,"" and those blood vessels get bigger. The extra blood turns the skin red. Researchers found that port-wine stains start with the mutation of one specific gene. What causes this change in a developing baby's DNA still isn't clear. In about 3% of people who have a port wine stain on the face, this same mutation causes Sturge-Weber syndrome, a condition that affects the brain . People with this syndrome have seizures and eye problems . They may have weak muscles, migraines , and trouble learning. What Happens to Port-Wine Stains Port-wine stain. Port-wine stains are a kind of vascular birthmark, meaning that they're related to the skin's blood vessels. They are made up of dilated capillaries that gradually increase with age. The color changes from pink to red to purple as the patient grows, and the lesions may become nodular during adult life. Because port-wine stains show no tendency to shrink, they may represent a significant, lifelong cosmetic problem. It’s unclear what causes them, but researchers found that port-wine stains start with the mutation of one specific gene that is triggered by unknown reasons. Unlike some other birthmarks, such as a ""stork bite"" or ""strawberry,"" a port-wine stain grows as the child grows. The birthmark will last into adulthood. The color usually gets darker, turning purple or a deep red. The skin of a port-wine stain often gets thicker, and it may go from feeling smooth to pebbly. The birthmark shouldn't itch or hurt, and it shouldn't bleed. If it does, you should have it checked by a doctor. Sometimes, a port-wine stain gets drier than the skin around it, and using moisturizer will help. Port-wine stains around an eye or on an eyelid might cause glaucoma , which can lead to blindness. What to Do About a Port-Wine Stain Your doctor can check the birthmark during a regular visit and let you know if there could be any problems. A port-wine stain, especially when it's large or on their face, might affect a kid's self-esteem. It might make others treat them differently, too. If you're concerned, ask your doctor about your options. For instance, laser treatments may help make port-wine stains smaller and lighter. The main thing you can do is talk with your child. Help them prepare for other people's questions and reactions. Explain that their birthmark is just a part of their body, like the color of their eyes or how tall they are. It has nothing to do with the kind of person they are."
28,What is Endocarditis?,"Bacteria are all around us, and many live on different parts of our body. But if you have heart problems, bacteria in your bloodstream can attach to damaged tissue and cause an infection called endocarditis. The inner lining of your heart and surface of its valves is called the endocardium. If germs or bacteria from other parts of your body, such as your mouth , spread through your blood and attach to this lining, it causes endocarditis. If the infection isn’t treated with antibiotics or surgery, it can do permanent damage and can even be deadly. The Symptoms If you develop endocarditis, you may get sudden symptoms, or you may develop them over time. The way you feel will depend on how healthy your heart is and what caused your infection. The symptoms can also vary from person to person, but you may: Feel like you have the flu . You may develop a fever , chills, and night sweats . You might also feel achiness in your muscles and joints. Have a new heart murmur . Endocarditis can cause a new or additional heart murmur, or unusual sound in your heartbeat, or changes to an existing one. See changes in your skin . Tiny bumps or spots may show up on your hands or feet . You might also see spots on the whites of your eyes or the roof of your mouth because of broken blood vessels. Your skin could be pale. Feel nauseated. You could lose interest in food, feel sick to your stomach , or vomit. Have pain on the left side of your body under your rib cage . This may be a sign your spleen is trying to fight the infection. See blood in your urine . You might be able to see it on your own, or your doctor might see it under a microscope. Have swelling. Your abdomen , legs, or feet could all have swelling. Who’s at Risk? If you have a healthy heart, it’s unlikely that you’ll develop endocarditis. You’re more likely to get it if you have heart problems or artificial heart valves, since this is where infection-causing germs can attach and multiply. Your odds are higher of getting endocarditis if you have damaged or artificial heart valves, or if you were born with a heart defect. You’re also at greater odds if you’ve used intravenous drugs or had endocarditis in the past. How It’s Diagnosed If you notice symptoms of endocarditis or your doctor thinks you might have it, they may suggest some tests. They’ll also likely listen to your heart with a stethoscope to see if you have a new or changed heart murmur. If they need more information before making a diagnosis, they may order one or more of the following tests: Blood tests. These will look for bacteria in your bloodstream or show other things related to endocarditis, such as anemia , which means you don’t have enough red blood cells. An echocardiogram or an electrocardiogram . These are tests that show how your heart is working. An echocardiogram uses an ultrasound device to produce images of your heart. An electrocardiogram uses sensors to measure the timing and length of your heartbeat. An X-ray. This will show if endocarditis has affected your heart or lungs . A CT scan or MRI . These tests use pictures to show your doctor if the infection has spread to another area of your body like your brain or chest. How Is Endocarditis Treated? In most cases, your doctor will prescribe antibiotics. Usually, you will stay in the hospital for about a week to receive them through an IV. You may need IV antibiotics for between 2 and 6 weeks, but some of that might be from home. Your team at the hospital will help you make arrangements to finish the medication and receive follow-up care. In some cases, endocarditis requires surgery to completely clear it, or to replace a damaged heart valve. Whether or not you need surgery will depend on your specific case and the type of infection you have. Prevention Understanding how to recognize the signs of endocarditis can help you get quick treatment. If you notice any symptoms, contact your doctor immediately. If you’re diagnosed with endocarditis, you may want to get a special card from the American Heart Association to keep in your wallet. Dental hygiene is an important part of endocarditis prevention. Germs from infections in your mouth can travel to your heart through your bloodstream and cause the infection. Always make sure to brush and floss your teeth and gums and go to the dentist regularly. You should also be cautious about getting piercings or tattoos if you’re at higher risk for developing endocarditis. These kinds of procedures can make it easier for germs to get into your system. If you get a skin infection or cut that doesn’t heal properly, you should contact your doctor. Before getting any kind of medical or dental procedure, be sure to let your doctor or dentist know that you may be at risk for endocarditis. That way, they can decide whether to prescribe antibiotics before your procedure as a precaution to keep you safe from infection."
29,Dental Health and Endocarditis Prevention,"Endocarditis is a rare, life-threatening inflammation of the lining of the heart muscle and its valves. It is caused by a bacterial infection . Although it can occur in anyone, it is much more common in people with certain heart conditions and in those who've had it before. If your risk is high, you can take steps to lower it. How Have Endocarditis Prevention Guidelines Changed? In 2007, the American Heart Association Endocarditis Committee -- together with other experts -- issued guidelines to help prevent endocarditis. These replaced guidelines issued in 1997. After reviewing published studies, the committee found that only a small number of cases of infective endocarditis might be prevented by antibiotics for dental procedures. In patients with heart conditions associated with the highest risk of serious complications from endocarditis, it says that antibiotic treatment before dental procedures involving manipulation of the gums seems reasonable. In very rare cases, bacteria in the mouth may trigger endocarditis in people at higher risk. Here's what happens: Bacteria found in tooth plaque may multiply and cause gingivitis ( gum disease ). If not treated, this may become advanced. The gums become inflamed (red and swollen) and often bleed during tooth brushing, flossing, or certain dental procedures involving manipulation of the gums. When gums bleed, the bacteria can enter the bloodstream and can infect other parts of the body. In the case of endocarditis, this affects the inner lining of the heart and the surfaces of its valves. The bacteria stick to these surfaces and create growths or pockets of bacteria. Because this is so rare, the new guidelines suggest antibiotics prior to dental procedures only for patients who are at highest risk for serious complications from endocarditis. In fact, in most cases, the risk of problems from antibiotics exceeds the benefits from preventive antibiotics. These attract blood products that may lead to clots. Who Should Receive Antibiotics Before Having a Dental Treatment? To prevent endocarditis, patients with certain heart conditions receive a single dose of an antibiotic. You receive it about one hour prior to certain dental treatments. The American Heart Association and American Dental Association now suggest that you receive antibiotics prior to dental treatment only if you have: Had bacterial endocarditis before A prosthetic (artificial) cardiac valve or prosthetic material used in valve repair Cardiac valve disease and have had a cardiac transplant Congenital (present at birth) heart disease. This includes only people with the following: Unrepaired cyanotic congenital heart disease (including those with devices that relieve symptoms only) Completely repaired congenital heart defect with prosthetic material or device during the first six months after the procedure Repaired congenital heart disease with defects that remain at or near the site of a prosthetic patch or prosthetic device What Dental Procedures Are Antibiotics Recommended For? The new guidelines suggest preventive treatment for all patients with cardiac conditions listed above, but not for all dental procedures. The guidelines suggest treatment only: During dental procedures that involve manipulation of gingival tissue (around bone and teeth) or the periapical region of teeth (tip of the tooth root) When the inside lining of the mouth is perforated The guidelines do not recommend antibiotics for these dental procedures or events: Routine anesthetic injections through noninfected tissue Dental X-rays Placement of removable prosthodontic or orthodontic appliances Adjustment of orthodontic appliances Placement of orthodontic brackets Shedding of baby teeth Bleeding from trauma to the lips or inside of the mouth Is There Anything Else I Can Do to Lower My Risk for Bacterial Endocarditis? Tell your dentist if your health has changed since your last visit. Be sure to let your dentist know if you've had heart or vascular surgery within the past six months. Also report if you have been diagnosed with other heart conditions. Make sure your dentist has a complete list of the names and dosages of your medications , both prescription and over-the-counter. Make sure your dentist has the names and phone numbers of all of your doctors. Your dentist may want to consult with your doctor about your dental care plan and medication choices. Practice good oral hygiene. Brush your teeth at least twice a day; floss at least once daily; rinse with an antiseptic mouthwash at least once a day. Good oral and dental health is very important for patients at risk for endocarditis. What Are the Symptoms of Endocarditis? Possible symptoms of endocarditis include: Unexplained fever Night chills Weakness, muscle pain , or joint pain Sluggishness (lethargy) or malaise (general ill feeling) Keep in mind that receiving antibiotics greatly lowers the risk of endocarditis. However, it is not a guarantee. Also keep in mind that most cases of procedure-related endocarditis occur within two weeks of the procedure. So if you have any of these symptoms beyond this time, it is not very likely that you have endocarditis. It is always wise to check with your doctor or dentist if you have any concerns."
30,Understanding Endometrial Cancer -- the Basics,"What Is Endometrial Cancer? Cancer can affect the uterus, the hollow, pear-shaped organ where a baby grows. The uterus is lined with a special tissue called the endometrium. When cancer grows in this lining, it is called endometrial cancer . Most cancers of the uterus are endometrial cancer. If left untreated, endometrial cancer can spread to the bladder or rectum, or it can spread to the vagina , fallopian tubes, ovaries, and more distant organs. Fortunately, endometrial cancer grows slowly and, with regular checkups, is usually found before spreading very far. What Does the Type of Endometrial Cancer Mean? If you get diagnosed with endometrial cancer, your doctor might tell you it’s type 1 or type 2. About 80% of endometrial cancers are type 1. This kind usually doesn’t form, grow, or spread very quickly. Experts think it’s caused by having too much of the sex hormone estrogen. Sometimes it develops from a condition called atypical hyperplasia, which is when too many cells grow in the endometrium. The prognosis for people with type 1 endometrial cancer is usually good. Prognosis is an estimate of how the course of the disease will go for you. Up to 20% of endometrial cancer is type 2. This type is more likely to grow and spread outside of your uterus. Experts don’t think that having too much estrogen causes it. The prognosis (outlook) isn’t as good compared with type 1. Doctors usually need to treat type 2 endometrial cancer with more intense treatments. Grading Endometrial Cancer If you get a diagnosis of type 1 or type 2 endometrial cancer, your doctor might talk to you about its “grade.” For most cancers, the grade (also called “differentiation”) is a number that tells you how abnormal your cancer cells look under a microscope. A lower number means the cancer cells are more normal-looking, and in general that means your cancer is more likely to be slow-growing. For instance, grades 1 and 2 endometrioid adenocarcinoma are considered type 1 endometrial cancer. Your doctor may call these “lower grade.” Grade 3 endometrioid tumors are considered type 2 endometrial cancer. The doctor might call it higher grade or “poorly differentiated.” Are There Different Kinds of Endometrial Cancer? Yes. Doctors divide them up into different categories based on how their cells look under a microscope. The most common type of endometrial cancer is a kind of adenocarcinoma (cancer that forms in glandular tissue) called endometroid cancer. Endometrioid cancer starts in the glands of your endometrium (uterine lining), and under the microscope it looks very similar to normal uterine lining (endometrium). It varies from person to person in terms of how severe it is. Some other kinds of endometrial cancer are: Uterine papillary serous carcinoma: This rarer form of endometrial and uterine cancer starts in the lining of the uterus. It tends to come back even if your doctor spots it early. Uterine clear cell carcinoma: This form is even more rare, accounting for less than 5% of cases. Uterine carcinosarcoma: This rare kind of endometrial and uterine cancer also makes up less than 5% of cases, but it tends to be aggressive. That means it forms, grows, or spreads quickly. What Are the Risk Factors for Endometrial Cancer? Endometrial cancer usually happens in women past menopause. More than 95% of endometrial cancer happens in women over 40. Postmenopausal women have a high risk for endometrial cancer if they: Got their first period early Went through menopause late Are obese Have diabetes or high blood pressure Have few or no children Have a history of infertility , irregular periods, or abnormal cells in the endometrium (called endometrial hyperplasia) Have a family history of endometrial, colorectal, or breast cancer Women taking the drug tamoxifen to treat or prevent breast cancer have a slightly higher risk of endometrial cancer. But women who have taken birth control pills are only half as likely to have endometrial cancer after menopause. Women who take estrogen-only hormone replacement therapy have a higher risk of developing endometrial cancer. So women who have not had a hysterectomy should not be taking estrogen-only hormone replacement therapy . Rare ovarian tumors can make estrogen and increase a woman’s chance of having endometrial cancer. High-fat diets, especially containing red meat, can increase the risk of cancer, including endometrial and colon cancer . What Are the Survival Rates for Endometrial Cancer? It depends on how far your cancer has spread when you’re first diagnosed with it. To show the survival rates for endometrial cancer, the American Cancer Society uses a database that groups this type of cancer into three stages that describe how far it has spread: Localized means there’s no sign that your endometrial cancer has spread beyond your uterus. Regional means the disease has spread to nearby areas or lymph nodes. Distant means the cancer has spread far away, to parts of the body like your lungs, liver, or bones. If you have localized endometrial cancer, the 5-year relative survival rate is 96%. That means that people who have your type of cancer are about 96% as likely as people who don’t have that cancer to live for at least 5 years, on average, after they’re diagnosed. The 5-year relative survival rate for regional endometrial cancer is 71%. For distant endometrial cancer it’s 20%. Keep in mind that other things affect your outlook, like your age, general health, and how well you respond to treatment. And if you’ve just gotten diagnosed with endometrial cancer, you may have a better outlook than these numbers suggest. That’s because treatments get better over time, and these numbers are based on women who got diagnosed and treated at least 5 years earlier. Can Endometrial Cancer Be Prevented? Most endometrial cancer cannot be prevented. But there are certain things women can do to lower their risk. Taking birth control lowers the risk, but first talk with a doctor about possible pros and cons. Being healthy, eating well, and watching your weight may help lower the risk."
31,What Is Enterovirus D68?,"Enterovirus D68 is a virus that can make you feel like you have a cold. If it's severe, it could also make you wheeze or have trouble breathing , especially if you have asthma or other respiratory problems. Most cases are mild and last about a week, but if it's severe, you may need to go to the hospital. Babies, children, and teens are the most likely to get it. People with weak immune systems  and those with severe chronic medical conditions have the biggest risk for severe complications. This virus isn't new. Experts first identified it in 1962. In the decades since then, it only seemed to impact a very small number of people. That changed in 2014, when the CDC reported a national outbreak. There are more than 100 other enteroviruses. Symptoms You could have a fever, a runny nose , sneezing , and coughing . You might feel achy, too. The virus can also lead to wheezing and trouble breathing, especially in children who have asthma or other respiratory problems. It can cause bronchiolitis in babies and toddlers leading to  wheezing and difficulty in breathing. It's very rare, but enteroviruses may cause other serious problems, such as muscle paralysis or inflammation of the brain or heart . Who's At Risk? Anyone can get it, but children age 6 weeks to 16 years may be especially vulnerable. Infants and people who have immune system disorders are the most likely to develop severe complications. How It Spreads You can catch this virus the same way you would catch the common cold: by having close contact with someone who's infected -- especially if that person coughs or sneezes on you -- or by touching a contaminated surface. You can lower your chances of getting it by following these tips: Wash your hands often. Scrub with soap for 20 seconds. (especially before eating) Don't touch your eyes , nose, or mouth unless you've just washed your hands. Don't hug, kiss, or share food with anyone who's sick. If someone in your house is ill, it's a good idea to regularly disinfect surfaces that are touched a lot, such as toys and doorknobs. A person who is ill should always cover their mouth when coughing/sneezing, wear a mask and wash hands often.  Staying in a separate room in the house helps contain the infection. Treatment No medicines target this virus. Antibiotics won't help, since the illness is not caused by bacteria. You can take an over-the-counter pain/fever reliever, which might help you feel a little better, just like with a normal cold. If your symptoms are severe, you should call your doctor or go to the emergency room. If it's an emergency -- for instance, you're having trouble breathing -- call 911. You may need to be hospitalized."
32,Tennis Elbow (Lateral Epicondylitis),"What Is Tennis Elbow? Tennis elbow is a common injury for people ages 30-60 and causes pain in the outer part of your elbow. Most people don't need surgery to get relief. (Photo Credit: Science Photo Library/Getty Images) Tennis elbow, also known as lateral epicondylitis, is a type of tendinitis (swelling of the tendons) that causes pain in your elbow and arm. These tendons are bands of tough tissue that connect the muscles of your lower arm to the bone. Causes of Tennis Elbow Despite the name, you can get tennis elbow even if you've never been near a tennis court. Any repeated arm movement can inflame your tendons. Tennis elbow is the most common reason for elbow pain. It can pop up in people of any age, but it most hits people between ages 30 and 60. Tennis elbow usually develops over time. Repeated motions, like gripping a tennis racket during a swing, can strain your muscles and leave the work up to your tendons, causing them to become inflamed and ripe for microscopic tears. Tennis elbow might result from jobs or hobbies that require repeated arm movements such as: Tennis Racquetball Squash Fencing Weightlifting Carpentry Typing Painting Raking Knitting Symptoms of Tennis Elbow The main symptom of tennis elbow is pain and tenderness in the bony knob on the outside of your elbow. This knob is where the injured tendons connect to the bone. The pain may also radiate into your upper or lower arm, and you can have tennis elbow in both arms. Although the tendon damage is in your elbow, you're likely to feel pain when doing things with your hands. Tennis elbow pain may be most intense when you: Lift something Make a fist or grip an object, such as a tennis racket Open a door or shake hands Raise your hand or straighten your wrist Talk to your doctor if you have any of these symptoms: Trouble moving your arm(s) A lump or bulge in your elbow or arm Pain that keeps you from your everyday activities Your elbow is red or swollen Tennis elbow pain usually worsens over time. Talk to your doctor if your symptoms don't improve for several months. Tennis Elbow Diagnosis Your doctor will ask about your symptoms and medical history. They’ll check for pain in parts of your arm and ask you to move your arm, elbow, wrist, and fingers in certain ways to see if you have discomfort. They may also do more tests like: Electromyography will help your doctor see whether you have a problem with the nerves in your elbow. MRI can show how severe the damage is to the tendons in your elbow. It also can find arthritis in your neck or problems in your back that could cause pain in your elbow. X-rays can look at the bones in your elbow to check for arthritis. Treatment for Tennis Elbow Rest is the best treatment for tennis elbow. It usually heals on its own if you can stop the constant movements that caused it. Here are other nonsurgical ways to treat tennis elbow: Ice : Experts recommend icing for 15 minutes every 3 to 4 hours to reduce pain and swelling. Mulligan mobilisation with movement and taping : This is a form of physical therapy that repositions the muscles to protect the injured tendons from further strain. Physical therapy : A professional can show you exercises to strengthen and stretch the muscles in your shoulder, upper arm, and wrists. Steroids : Shots into your elbow tendons can briefly ease some of the swelling and pain around your elbow joint. Botox : Studies show that these shots can treat chronic tennis elbow. Needle fenestration : This treatment uses a special ultrasound to repeatedly guide a needle into the injured tendon to increase blood flow and promote healing. Ultrasonic tenotomy : Also called Tenex, this procedure uses ultrasound to guide a needle into the damaged tendon. Then the needle is vibrated with ultrasonic energy so fast, it turns injured tissue to liquid so it can be removed. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) therapy : Your platelets (cells in your blood that stop bleeding) are separated from your other blood cells and then injected back into the injured tendons to encourage healing. Most of the time, these treatments will do the trick. You can also take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ), such as ibuprofen , naproxen , or aspirin , for pain and swelling. If you have a severe case of tennis elbow that doesn't respond to 2-4 months of  treatment, you may need surgery. You and your doctor will decide which type of surgery is best for you. Surgical options include: Open surgery . Your surgeon makes a cut above the bone on the side of your elbow, removes the damaged tendon, and reattaches the healthy part back to the bone. They might also remove a tiny piece of bone in your elbow to improve blood flow and help the area heal faster. Arthroscopic surgery . Your surgeon makes a few tiny cuts in the skin over your elbow. Then they use very small instruments and a camera to perform the procedure. With either type of surgery, the opening is closed with sutures (a row of stitches) or staples. Then it's covered with a bandage or other dressing. You should be able to go home on the same day as your surgery. Recovering From Tennis Elbow How long it takes to recover from tennis elbow depends on the extent of the damage to your tendon and your treatment. But don't rush the healing process. If you start pushing yourself to use your arm too early, you could make the damage worse. You're ready to return to your former level of activity when: Gripping objects or bearing weight on your arm or elbow is no longer painful. Your injured elbow feels as strong as your other elbow. Your elbow is no longer swollen. You can flex and move your elbow without any trouble. How to Prevent Tennis Elbow As much as you can, try not to overuse your elbow. Stop if you feel any elbow pain during an activity. You can also: In general : Make sure your arms are strong and flexible. Avoid repetitive arm and wrist movements. Use your shoulder and upper arms to take the strain off your elbow. Avoid bending or straightening your arm all the way. At work : Avoid working with a bent wrist. Keep it straight, if possible. Talk to your manager about rotating jobs, doing different tasks, or changing your workstation setup to reduce strain. Hold tools with a looser grip to take some of the tension out of your hand. If you use a hammer, use one with padding to help absorb shock. For sports : Stretch and warm up before any sport or activity that will exercise your elbow or arm. If you have a coach, ask them to help with your form. The correct technique can help avoid injury. When playing tennis, stick with a two-handed backhand. Make sure you have fresh, dry tennis balls. Wet or ""dead"" tennis balls can aggravate your elbow. Use equipment for your height and weight, especially when playing tennis and golf. Ice your elbow after playing sports where you use your forearm. Exercises for Tennis Elbow Physical therapy is a common treatment for tennis elbow, whether you have surgery or not. Here are some of the exercises that may help your symptoms improve. Finger stretch : Place a rubber band around your fingers and thumb, and cup your hand. Slowly spread your thumb and fingers apart and then close them. Do three sets of 10, and repeat 2-3 times a day. If this starts to get too easy, use two rubber bands. Ball squeeze : Hold a tennis ball or stress ball in your hand. Squeeze and release. Do this 10 times, and repeat 5-7 times a week. If this movement causes you pain, use a softer object, like a sponge or balled-up socks. Wrist stretch : Hold your arm straight out with your palm facing down. Use your other hand to gently pull your fingers of your outstretched hand down toward your body until you feel the stretch in your inner forearm. Hold for 15 seconds. Repeat five times, then do the same motions with your other arm. Try this stretch up to four times a day. Wrist stretch : Hold your arm straight out with your palm facing up, like you're telling someone to stop. Use your other hand to gently pull your fingers of your outstretched hand toward your body until you can feel the stretch in your outer forearm. Hold for 15 seconds. Repeat five times, then do the same motions with your other arm. You can do this stretch up to four times a day. Wrist turn : Bend your elbow to 90 degrees by your side so it forms an L. Hold your hand out, with your palm up. Gently turn your wrist so your palm faces down. Hold for 5 seconds, and then slowly release. Do three sets of 10. Forearm strengthening : Bend your elbow 90 degrees. Support your forearm on a table with your wrist hanging off the edge. Slowly turn your palm so it faces up, moving only your forearm, not your elbow. Return your wrist to the start position, then slowly turn your palm down. Repeat. Do three sets of 10. When you can do 2 days of 30 reps without pain, add a 1-pound dumbbell; then add a 3-pound dumbbell. Towel twist : Hold a rolled-up towel in both hands, and relax your shoulders. Twist the towel in opposite directions (one hand rolling forward, the other pulling back), as if you’re wringing out water. After 10 twists, repeat, going in opposite directions. Do three sets of 10. Elbow curls While standing, place one foot out in front of the other. Loop one end of a resistance band under your back foot and hold the other end (or the handle) with your palm facing up. Pull the band up and curl your arm toward your shoulder. Do three sets of 10. Before you start any new exercises, talk to your doctor. And if anything hurts or you feel any discomfort, stop and talk to your doctor. Takeaways Tennis elbow is a type of tendinitis that causes pain in your elbow and arm. It's caused by repeated arm movements that trigger the muscles in your forearm to get tired, leaving the tendons to do all the work. Anybody can get tennis elbow, not just people who play tennis. It's usually treated with physical therapy, though rare cases may need surgery. Tennis Elbow FAQs What's the best way to fix tennis elbow? Physical therapy can be a great way to help heal tennis elbow. Many exercises can help improve your symptoms. They can also help promote blood flow to your injured tendons, which can speed up your recovery. How do you know if you have tennis elbow? Tennis elbow has very clear symptoms, including pain on the outside of your elbow that travels to your wrist. You'll feel discomfort when you grasp small things, or when you twist or bend your arm. What triggers tennis elbow? Doing the same arm movements over and over is the most common cause. Repeated motions trigger the muscles in your forearm to get tired, leaving the tendons to do the work and become inflamed."
33,An Overview of Meningococcal Meningitis,"Meningococcal meningitis is a rare but serious bacterial infection. It causes the membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord to become inflamed. Each year, approximately 1,000 people in the U.S. get meningococcal disease , which includes meningitis and septicemia ( blood infection ). Meningococcal meningitis can be fatal or cause great harm without prompt treatment; as many as one out of five people who contract the infection have serious complications. According to the Centers for Disease Control, even with antibiotics, 10 to 15% of those infected will die and about 1 in 5 of those who survive are left with long-term disabilities that include deafness , brain damage , neurological problems, and even loss of a limb. Here's what you need to know about the symptoms of meningococcal meningitis and ways to prevent and treat it. What Causes Meningococcal Meningitis? Bacteria and viruses are the two main causes of meningitis. The bacterium Neisseria meningitidis , also called meningococcus, causes meningococcal meningitis. In children and teens , meningococcus is the most common cause of bacterial meningitis . In adults, it is the second most common cause. Meningococcal bacteria may cause infection in a part of the body -- the skin , gastrointestinal tract, or respiratory tract, for instance. For unknown reasons, the bacteria may then spread through the bloodstream to the nervous system . When it gets there, it causes meningococcal meningitis. Bacteria can also enter the nervous system directly after severe head trauma , surgery, or infection. Your risk for meningococcal meningitis increases if you are exposed to the bacterium that causes it. Your risk also increases if you've had a recent upper respiratory infection. Babies, children, teens, and the elderly are at greatest risk. What Are the Symptoms of Meningococcal Meningitis? Symptoms of meningococcal meningitis may vary from case to case. The more common signs and symptoms include: General poor feeling Sudden high fever Severe, persistent headache Neck stiffness Nausea or vomiting Discomfort in bright lights Drowsiness or difficulty awakening Joint pain Confusion or other mental changes A reddish or purple skin rash ( known as petechiae) is a very important sign to watch for. If it does not turn white when you press a glass against it, the rash may be a sign of bacteremia, or a bacterial infection in the bloodstream. This is a medical emergency. Meningococcemia is a serious type of blood poisoning caused by the Neisseria meningitidis bacteria. A significant rash can develop as the infection damages blood vessels throughout the body. This infection is in an 11-year-old boy and is characterized by the star-like rash that is cherry red with a bluish tint. Other symptoms of meningitis or bacteremia may include: Tense or bulging soft spot (in babies) High-pitched or moaning cry (in babies) Stiff, jerky movements or floppiness (in babies or toddlers ) Irritability Fast breathing Lethargy or excessive sleepiness Blotchy skin, turning pale or blue Shivering, or cold hands and feet Seizure What's the Treatment for Meningococcal Meningitis? Meningococcal meningitis can cause death or serious complications, such as brain damage , paralysis, gangrene , or deafness . To prevent these problems, it's important to act quickly. Do not wait. Seek immediate medical attention. Go to an emergency room or call 911 if: You notice symptoms of meningococcal meningitis. Symptoms do not improve with treatment. You think you have been exposed to meningococcal meningitis. Tests can confirm a diagnosis of meningococcal meningitis. The doctor may start antibiotics , such as penicillin or ceftriaxone , by an IV, or intravenous line. You or your child may also need other medication to treat problems related to increased spinal fluid pressure. Doctors sometimes prescribe steroids . If you or someone you love has come into close contact (via saliva or other oral secretions) with someone who has meningococcal meningitis -- such as at school, day care , work, or home -- it is very important to get antibiotics to prevent infection. Are There Vaccines for Meningococcal Meningitis? Meningococcal meningitis is a serious disease -- even with treatment. That's why prevention is a far better approach. The meningococcal vaccine can prevent meningitis infection. In the U.S., three types of meningococcal vaccines are used: Meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MCV4) -- One of these vaccines , Menactra , is approved for people ages 9 months to 55. The other, Menveo , is used in those ages 2 through 55. Meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine (MPSV4) -- This vaccine was approved in the 1970s and protects against most forms of meningococcal disease. This vaccine used is for people as young as 9 months and older than age 55. Serogroup B Meningococcal B (MenB) - There are two MenB vaccines. Trumenba (MenB-FHbp) and Bexsero (MenB-4C). Both are licensed for ages 10-24 but can be used in older patients. Although they cannot prevent all types of meningococcal disease, both vaccines can prevent many types of the disease. Both are effective in nine out of 10 people. MCV4 tends to give longer protection and is better at preventing transmission of the disease. Doctors recommend a dose of MCV4, which is given as a shot, for children at age 11, and then a booster shot at age 16. If the first dose is missed, the MCV4 can be administered between ages 13 and 15, followed by a booster dose between ages 16 and 18. People ages 16-18 who are not high risk should also get a MenB vaccine. The vaccine is also designed for people ages 10-24 who are at high risk. It can be used in older adults. Other people at risk should also consider getting a vaccine. That includes: People who think they've been exposed to meningococcal meningitis College students living in dorms U.S. military recruits Travelers to areas of the world, such as Africa, where meningococcal disease is common People with a damaged spleen or with terminal complement component deficiency, which is an immune system disorder Lab personnel who are often exposed to the meningococcal bacteria A second dose is recommended for everyone. Wait to get vaccinated if you are very ill at the time you're scheduled for the shot. Avoid the vaccine if you: Have had a severe allergic reaction to a previous dose Have a severe allergy to any vaccine component Have ever had Guillain -Barre Syndrome or acute disseminated encephalomyelitis Mild pain or redness at the injection site is common and should not be a problem. But call your doctor right away if you have a strong reaction to the vaccine. This includes a high fever , weakness , or signs of an allergic reaction , such as trouble breathing , a fast heartbeat, or dizziness ."
34,Cholera,"Cholera is an infectious disease that causes severe watery diarrhea , which can lead to dehydration and even death if untreated. It is caused by eating food or drinking water contaminated with a bacterium called Vibrio cholerae . Cholera was prevalent in the U.S. in the 1800s, before modern water and sewage treatment systems eliminated its spread by contaminated water. Only about 10 cases of cholera are reported each year in the U.S. and half of these are acquired abroad. Rarely, contaminated seafood has caused cholera outbreaks in the U.S. However, cholera outbreaks are still a serious problem in other parts of the world. The World Health Organization reports that there are 1.3 million to 4 million cases each year. The disease is most common in places with poor sanitation, crowding, war, and famine. Common locations include parts of Africa, south Asia, and Latin America. If you are traveling to one of those areas, knowing the following cholera facts can help protect you and your family. Cholera Causes Vibrio cholerae , the bacterium that causes cholera, is usually found in food or water contaminated by feces from a person with the infection. Common sources include: Municipal water supplies Ice made from municipal water Foods and drinks sold by street vendors Vegetables grown with water containing human wastes Raw or undercooked fish and seafood caught in waters polluted with sewage When a person consumes the contaminated food or water, the bacteria release a toxin in the intestines that produces severe diarrhea . It is not likely you will catch cholera just from casual contact with an infected person. Cholera Symptoms Symptoms of cholera can begin as soon as a few hours or as long as five days after infection. Often, symptoms are mild. But sometimes they are very serious. About one in 20 people infected have severe watery diarrhea accompanied by vomiting , which can quickly lead to dehydration . Although many infected people may have minimal or no symptoms, they can still contribute to spread of the infection. Signs and symptoms of dehydration include: Rapid heart rate Loss of skin elasticity (the ability to return to original position quickly if pinched) Dry mucous membranes, including the inside of the mouth , throat, nose, and eyelids Low blood pressure Thirst Muscle cramps If not treated, dehydration can lead to shock and death in a matter of hours. Cholera Treatment and Prevention There is a vaccine for cholera. Both the CDC and the World Health Organization have specific guidelines for who should be given this vaccine. You can protect yourself and your family by using only water that has been boiled, water that has been chemically disinfected, or bottled water. Be sure to use bottled, boiled, or chemically disinfected water for the following purposes Drinking Preparing food or drinks Making ice Brushing your teeth Washing your face and hands Washing dishes and utensils that you use to eat or prepare food Washing fruits and vegetables To disinfect your own water, boil it for one minute (or 3 minutes at higher elevations) or filter it and use a commercial chemical disinfectant. You should also avoid raw foods, including the following: Unpeeled fruits and vegetables Unpasteurized milk and milk products Raw or undercooked meat or shellfish Fish caught in tropical reefs, which may be contaminated If you develop severe, watery diarrhea and vomiting -- particularly after eating raw shellfish or traveling to a country where cholera is epidemic -- seek medical help immediately. Cholera is highly treatable, but because dehydration can happen quickly, it's important to get cholera treatment right away. Hydration is the mainstay of treatment for cholera. Depending on how severe the diarrhea is, treatment will consist of oral or intravenous solutions to replace lost fluids. Antibiotics , which kill the bacteria, are not part of emergency treatment for mild cases. But they can reduce the duration of diarrhea by half and also reduce the excretion of the bacteria, thus helping to prevent the spread of the disease."
35,Spermatocele,"What Is a Spermatocele? A spermatocele (also called a spermatic or epididymal cyst ) is a fluid-filled sac that grows in the epididymis -- a tightly coiled tube about 20 feet long where the sperm matures as it passes through. It's in the scrotum and surrounds the back and top of the testicle. Spermatoceles vary in size. They typically don’t hurt, but they could cause pain if they grow too large. Spermatoceles can be smooth. They might also be filled with a whitish, cloudy fluid. Sometimes, they hold sperm. Most of the time, they’re benign (not cancerous). Still, if you notice a growth near or in your penis or scrotum (the pouch that holds your testicles), see your doctor to have it checked. Spermatoceles don’t impact fertility. Spermatocele Causes and Risk Factors Spermatoceles often contain pools of dead sperm. Doctors aren’t sure what causes this. Often, spermatoceles develop for no specific reason at all. Sometimes they might happen when one of the tubes that transport and store sperm gets blocked. Spermatocele risk factors Spermatoceles are actually quite common. About 3 out of 10 men will get them at some point in their lives. Men ages 20-50 are most likely to get them. They don’t have many known risk factors. Men whose mothers took the drug diethylstilbestrol in pregnancy might get them more. Doctors stopped using this drug in 1971. Spermatocele Diagnosis Most of the time, spermatoceles don’t hurt, so you may not have any symptoms. You might only feel a bump while examining your testicles. Your doctor might find it during an exam. As the cyst gets bigger, you may feel heaviness in your testicle. You might also notice a mass or swelling behind or above your testicle. Your doctor will likely do a couple of tests to make sure the growth is a spermatocele and not a tumor. They’ll probably start with a physical exam . You’ll also have a transillumination or an ultrasound . Transillumination is where your doctor shines a light through your scrotum. If the growth is a spermatocele, the light will shine through it. If it’s a mass, it won't. Ultrasound is the next step if transillumination doesn’t show fluid. This test uses high-frequency sound waves to create images on a screen. Spermatocele Treatment Most of the time, they’re not treated. Your doctor may prescribe pain relievers to make you more comfortable. Aspiration is a procedure that can help relieve some of the pain and pressure of spermatoceles. Your doctor will insert a needle into the cyst to remove some of the fluid. If the cyst refills and comes back, your doctor can do a procedure called a sclerotherapy. Your doctor will drain some of the fluid from the spermatocele. Then they’ll use a substance that causes the sac to fill with scar tissue. This tissue could lower the risk of the spermatocele coming back. But it can damage the epididymis. Your doctor may suggest this option only if you’re not interested in having children. In rare cases (if the spermatocele is getting in the way of your daily life), your doctor could remove it through surgery. Your doctor will numb the area, make a small incision (cut) in your scrotum or groin, and remove the growth. Spermatocele Prevention There’s no way to prevent a spermatocele. But, it’s a good idea to check your scrotum regularly to notice changes, including any masses. Follow these steps to examine your testicles: Using a mirror, look for any swelling. Examine each testicle with both hands, placing the index and middle fingers underneath and thumbs on top. Gently roll each testicle between your thumbs and fingers. Do a self-check once a month. This way, it will be easier to notice if anything changes. If you feel a lump or anything else unusual, call your doctor."
36,Epididymitis,"What Is Epididymitis? Epididymitis is when the epididymis -- a long, coiled tube at the back of each of a man’s two testicles -- is inflamed. It’s usually caused by a sexually transmitted infection, but several other types of bacteria can cause epididymitis as well. What does the epididymis do? The epididymis carries sperm from the testes, which produce it, to the vas deferens, a tube behind the bladder . The epididymis lies in coils around the back of a man’s testicle and can be nearly 20 feet long. It can take nearly 2 weeks for sperm to make it from one end of the epididymis to the other. In that time, the sperm cells mature to the point where they’re able to fertilize a woman’s egg cell. Epididymitis Symptoms When a bacterial infection strikes, the epididymis gradually becomes swollen and painful. This usually happens on one testicle, rather than both. It can last up to 6 weeks if untreated. You might have one or more of these other possible symptoms: Redness, swelling, or tenderness in the scrotum, the sac that contains the testes A more frequent or urgent need to pee A lump on your testicle Painful urination or ejaculation Fever Bloody urine Discomfort in your lower abdomen Enlarged lymph nodes in your groin A lump on your testicle See your doctor if you have any of these symptoms. Related conditions Epididymitis shares many of the symptoms of a more serious problem called testicular torsion (that’s when a testicle gets turned around the cord that connects it to the body). Testicular torsion symptoms usually develop much faster, however. Torsion is an emergency that may cause you to lose a testicle if you don’t get treatment quickly. When the swelling and tenderness extends past the epididymis and into the testicle itself, that’s known as epididymo- orchitis . Epididymitis Causes The most common causes of epididymitis are a pair of sexually transmitted infections: gonorrhea and chlamydia . About 600,000 cases of epididymitis are reported in the United States every year, mostly in men between 18 and 35. In men older than 35, epididymitis usually happens because of an infection of the bladder or urinary tract. Some cases of epididymitis are caused by the E. coli bacteria, or in rare cases, by the same bacteria that causes tuberculosis . Tell your partners If your condition is the result of a sexually transmitted disease , you should tell anyone with whom you have had sex in the past 60 days about your diagnosis. If it’s been more than 60 days since you had sex, contact your most recent sex partner. They should see a doctor and get tested for sexually transmitted diseases as well. Epididymitis Risk Factors Your chances of having epididymitis rise if you have: Sex with someone who has a sexually transmitted infection (STI) A history of STIs A history of infections in your prostate or urinary tract A history of procedures that impact your urinary tract An uncircumcised penis An enlarged prostate Epididymitis in Children Kids can also get epididymitis. An STI, urinary tract infection , or a physical problem in the urinary and reproductive organs can cause the condition. Symptoms in children are similar to those in adults: Testicle pain and swelling Fever A heavy feeling in your testicles Leaking fluid from the urethra Blood in your semen A lump in your testicles Pain while peeing or during ejaculation Epididymitis Diagnosis When you go to the doctor, they will examine your scrotum for signs of infection and ask you questions about your symptoms. They might also do a rectal exam to check your prostate and check for any tenderness. If your doctor suspects epididymitis based on the exam, you might get one or more tests. They include: Urine sample: You may pee into a cup so a lab can check for signs of an infection. Blood sample: This can also find abnormalities. Swab sample: For this test, your doctor inserts a narrow swab into the tip of your penis to get a sample of discharge. This is used to test for chlamydia or gonorrhea. Ultrasound : You might also be asked to sit for an ultrasound test, which uses sound waves to produce an image of your scrotum and testicles. Epididymitis Treatment The most common treatment for epididymitis is antibiotics . If your doctor believes you have epididymitis, they might give you a prescription for antibiotics before any lab test results are even back. You’ll likely take those medications for a week or two, and you’ll usually start feeling better in a matter of days. Always take your full course of antibiotics as prescribed, even when you feel better. Even after your antibiotics take effect, some swelling may last for weeks or months, and you may still be sore during that time. You can reduce the pain and swelling by taking over-the-counter pain relievers, applying a cold compress, or elevating your scrotum (you might wear supportive underwear, like a jockstrap). Epididymitis Complications If left untreated, epididymitis can become a “chronic” condition, one that lingers and causes recurring problems. Epididymitis might also cause an infection in the scrotum. In rare cases, it can damage a man’s ability to make a woman pregnant ."
37,First Aid for Epilepsy Seizures,"You can help protect someone during a seizure by being prepared to take simple steps. But you can help protect someone from harm during one. Some seizures are more dangerous than others, but most aren't an emergency. If you want to do something for the person, focus on keeping them safe. What Seizures Look Like The type of seizure most people will think of is the generalized tonic-clonic seizure, better known as a grand mal seizure. They're frightening to watch, and someone who has one rarely knows or remembers what's happening. These seizures follow a pattern: The person seems to ""check out."" They won't answer if you talk to them. They won't react if you wave a hand in their face or shake them. They may collapse. Their muscles clench and they become as rigid as a board. (This is the tonic phase. It lasts a few seconds.) Next comes a series of jerking movements. (This is the clonic phase. It can last a few seconds or several minutes.) Eventually, the jerking stops and they're alert and can talk again, but they may be dazed or unsteady for a little while. Any generalized seizure can be dangerous because the person is unaware of their surroundings and can't protect themselves from harm. The uncontrolled thrashing raises their chances of getting hurt. Focal seizures are different. They're less intense and usually last no more than a minute or two. Part of their body, like an arm, might get stiff or go floppy. You may see repeated, rhythmic, or jerking movements in one place or that spread to different body parts. The person could zone out or stare at nothing. They may or may not realize what's happening but can't control it. When it's over, they won't remember a thing. What You Can Do It's all about taking precautions. For someone having a generalized tonic-clonic seizure: Give them room. Keep other people back. Clear hard or sharp objects, like glasses and furniture, away. Cushion their head. Loosen clothing around their neck, if you can safely. Don't try to hold them down or stop their movements. Don't put anything in their mouth . Contrary to popular myth, you can't swallow your tongue during a seizure. But putting something in their mouth could damage their teeth , or they might bite you. If their head isn't moving, turn it to one side. Look at your watch at the start of the seizure, so you can time its length. Remember, this probably isn't an emergency, although it may look like one. After the jerking stops, gently place them on their side, to help keep their airway clear. For milder seizures, like a bit of staring or shaking arms or legs, guide the person away from hazards, including traffic, stairs, and water. Don't leave someone who's had a seizure alone. Stay until they're fully aware of where they are and can respond normally when you talk to them. Speak calmly. Reassure them and explain what they missed if they're confused or frightened. Don't give them anything to drink or eat until they've completely recovered. Rescue Medications/Treatments There are medicines and treatments which can and should be used in specific situations. Referred to as “rescue medications,” they do not take the place of daily medications and should only be used to help stop a seizure quickly in emergency situations. Depending on the circumstance, they can be administered: Nasally - Sprayed up the nose Orally - Swallowed in pill form Sublingually - Placed under the tongue to dissolve Buccally - Placed between the cheek and the gum to dissolve Rectally - Given via a gel through the anus The most commonly used medications are benzodiazepines because they get into the bloodstream quickly to start working on the brain to stop the seizure. They include: Diazepam - given orally (if the person is awake), as a nasal spray - Valtoco rectally - Diastat orally, sublingual (if the person is awake) - Lorazepam Midazolam - can be given nasally ( Nayzilam ), buccally, orally When to Call 911 Get medical help when: It's a child's first seizure. The seizure lasts longer than 5 minutes. Another seizure begins soon after the first. The person doesn't ""wake up"" after the movements have stopped. The person was injured during the seizure. If you're concerned that something else may be wrong, or the person has another medical condition such as heart disease or diabetes , call a doctor."
38,Ataxia: What Are the Types?,"Ataxia is a movement disorder caused by problems in the brain . When you have ataxia, you have trouble moving parts of your body the way you want. Or the muscles in your arms and legs might move when you don’t want them to. The word ataxia actually means “without coordination.” Ataxia isn’t a disorder or a disease itself -- it’s a sign of other underlying disorders or diseases. Doctors have discovered anywhere from 50 to 100 different ataxias. They are grouped into categories based on what causes them, or based on which part of the body they affect. Types of Ataxia by Affected Area Ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) is rare genetic disease that affects the nervous system, the immune system, and many other parts of the body. Also known as Louis-Bar syndrome, dilated blood vessels and poor coordination are typical hallmarks of the condition. Small clusters of enlarged blood vessels called telangiectases can occur in the eyes and on the surface of the skin. People with A-T can easily develop lung infections and are at risk of developing cancers of the blood and immune system. Symptoms of A-T can appear in childhood and progress with age. Ataxia is caused by damage to different areas of the central nervous system. Doctors categorize it by the specific part of the brain most affected, including: Cerebellar ( brain ) Sensory (nerves) Vestibular ( ears ) Cerebellar Ataxia Your cerebellum is the part of your brain that’s in charge of balance and coordination. If part of your cerebellum starts to wear away, you can develop cerebellar ataxia. Sometimes it can also affect your spinal cord. It’s the most common form of ataxia. Symptoms of cerebellar ataxia include: Changes in your voice Dizziness Fatigue Headaches Muscle tremors Slurred speech Trouble walking Wide gait Sensory Ataxia Sensory ataxia is the result of damage to nerves in your spinal cord or your peripheral nervous system. That is the part of your nervous system outside of the brain and spinal cord. When you have sensory ataxia, you have less sensation in your feet and legs from the nerve damage , so you have less feedback from your brain telling you where your body is in relation to the ground. It’s also called proprioceptive ataxia. Symptoms of sensory ataxia include: Difficulty touching your finger to your nose with closed eyes Inability to sense vibrations Trouble walking in dim light Walking with a “heavy step,” or stomping when you walk Vestibular Ataxia Vestibular ataxia affects your vestibular system. This system is made up of your inner ear and ear canals, which contain fluid. They sense the movements of your head and help with your balance and spatial orientation. When the nerves in your vestibular system are affected, you can have the following problems: Blurred vision and other eye issues Nausea and vomiting Problems standing and sitting Staggering when you walk Trouble walking in a straight line Vertigo , or dizziness Causes of Ataxia Around 150,000 people in the U.S. deal with some form of ataxia. There are different causes for it. Some are genetic, some are acquired, like injuries, and some have no known clear cause. Genetic. You can inherit a certain mutated, or changed, gene from one or both of your parents that causes ataxia. Or you may inherit a mutated gene that causes a disorder with ataxia as a symptom. Some of the specific types of genetic ataxia include: Ataxia telangiectasia Ataxia with oculomotor apraxia Dominant spastic ataxias Dominant spinocerebellar ataxias ( SCA ) Episodic ataxia Friedreich's ataxia Recessive spastic ataxias Wilson’s disease Acquired. Acquired ataxia occurs when you have damage to your spinal cord or nerves. The damage might be from an injury or an illness. Some of the causes of acquired ataxia could include: Brain tumors Brain hemorrhage (bleeding) Cerebral palsy Chickenpox Hydrocephalus , or too much fluid buildup in the brain Head trauma Multiple sclerosis Reactions to certain cancers Vitamin E or B12 deficiency You can also get ataxia if you have a reaction to certain medications , from alcohol or drug use, or from exposure to poison. Idiopathic. When you haven’t inherited a mutated gene or had an illness or injury that could have caused your ataxia, it’s called idiopathic ataxia. Your doctor will diagnose you with idiopathic ataxia if they can’t find a medical reason for your ataxia symptoms. The most common idiopathic ataxia is called multiple system atrophy , or MSA. Doctors haven’t pinned down possible causes for this group of ataxias. They may come from a combination of environmental factors and genetic causes. Diagnosing Ataxia In order to diagnose your ataxia, your doctor will give you a physical exam . They’ll check your balance and coordination, hearing, vision , reflexes, and memory. You’ll also need a neurological exam, which might include an MRI or CT scan . These look at the structure of your brain for problems. For some cases, your doctor may recommend tests of your spinal fluid. To do this, they’ll insert a needle into your lower back and draw out the fluid to send it to a lab for testing. To rule out genetic forms of ataxia, you may need genetic testing . But, not all genetic forms of ataxia have tests to find them. Treating Ataxia The best treatment for your ataxia symptoms depends on the type you have. There is no specific treatment for ataxia itself. If your ataxia is a symptom of another disorder, your doctor will treat that disorder. If it’s due to a cause that you can avoid, like lack of vitamins or exposure to poison, your doctor will help you address the problem causing the ataxia. In order to help you cope with your symptoms, your doctor may recommend: Counseling Physical or occupational therapy Speech therapy Support groups Your doctor can also help you find tools so you can move around easier, such as a cane or a walker. There are also utensils to help you eat and speak more easily. Learn more about qualifying for disability for ataxia ."
39,"Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) Infection: Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment","What Is Epstein-Barr Virus? The Epstein-Barr virus is one of the most common human viruses in the world and spreads mostly through saliva. (Photo Credit: Kateryna Kon/Dreamstime) The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is very common and very contagious. You spread it through your saliva and other body fluids, and it can cause mononucleosis (aka mono), as well as other illnesses. Epstein-Barr is a type of herpesvirus known as herpesvirus 4. Once you're infected with EBV, the virus stays in your body forever. It can stay inactive or it can reactivate and you can have symptoms again. You may have been infected without even knowing it because some people have the virus and don't get sick. Symptoms of Epstein-Barr Virus Once you're infected with EBV, symptoms can take 4 to 6 weeks to show up, but you can still pass it to others during that time. When symptoms appear, they're often mild, especially in young children, though they may not show signs of infection at all. Most symptoms tend to be  like those of a cold or the flu. Teens often have more obvious symptoms of mono , including extreme fatigue. Symptoms of Epstein-Barr virus usually include: Fatigue Fever Lack of appetite Rash Sore throat Swollen glands in the neck Weak and sore muscles Enlarged spleen and liver Although you should start feeling better in 2-4 weeks, you could feel tired for a couple of months. How Does EBV Spread? The virus is very contagious and spreads through your saliva , so you can catch it from kissing someone who’s infected. EBV also spreads easily from person to person through: Coughing or sneezing Sharing drinks or food Sexual contact Sharing toothbrushes, drinking glasses, or utensils Touching toys or pacifiers kids put in their mouths Stages of Epstein-Barr Virus Infection with Epstein-Barr virus happens in three phases: Infection . The virus copies itself in your body, and you may or may not have symptoms. Latency . EBV basically goes to sleep in your body. Reactivation . The virus can sometimes ""wake up"" and cause symptoms again. Epstein-Barr Diagnosis It's hard to tell whether you're infected with EBV just by your symptoms. Fever, fatigue , and sore throat could also be signs of other illnesses, like the flu or a cold. See your doctor for an exam to find out what's making you sick. They might find signs that you have mono, such as an enlarged spleen, an organ in your belly that filters blood. Your doctor will also check to see if you have a swollen liver and white patches on your tonsils. EBV tests Your doctor may need to run some blood tests to look for antibodies, substances your immune system makes against the virus . The tests can show if you currently have EBV, or if you had an infection in the past. Other tests look for white blood cells your body uses to fight off the EBV infection. There is also a test called monospot you can buy online. Monospot is a blood test that can tell you in 5-10 minutes whether you’re positive or negative for EBV. The CDC doesn’t recommend you use this Epstein-Barr test at home because it’s not very accurate, especially compared to those your doctor can run. Your body makes the same antibodies monospot detects against many infections , not just EBV. The test can have false-positive and false-negative results, which means that it could find EBV when you don’t have the virus or miss EBV when you do have it. Epstein-Barr Virus Treatment As with other viruses, Epstein-Barr can't be treated with antibiotics. Right now, there’s no specific treatment for EBV, but researchers are looking at some medicines that may work against the virus. Dipyridamole is a drug that may help prevent EBV from reactivating in your body. It’s already approved to prevent blood clots in people who've had heart valve replacements. Researchers are now studying dipyridamole for EBV in clinical trials. Symptoms of EBV should clear up on their own in a few weeks with rest, fluids, and over-the-counter medications . EBV Complications There are many Epstein-Barr virus long-term effects. The virus can affect many parts of your body, including the nervous system, blood, and lungs. EBV may cause complications like: Heart muscle swelling called myocarditis Increased risk for cancers like Burkitt’s lymphoma, Hodgkin’s and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and cancer of the upper throat (nasopharyngeal cancer) Lung diseases like pneumonia Problems with the brain and spinal cord, such as meningitis, encephalitis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome Rupture of the spleen Sinus infection ( bacterial sinusitis ) Swelling of the pancreas (pancreatitis) Swelling of the tonsils Weakening of the immune system that makes it harder to fight off infections Chronic EBV EBV symptoms usually go away within 2 weeks to a month after you're infected. Then the virus goes dormant. But rarely, EBV symptoms don’t clear up. The virus stays active. A small number of people have symptoms like a fever, swollen glands, and an enlarged liver or spleen that come and go or get worse over time. If you have symptoms and positive blood tests for at least 3 months, you may have a chronic active EBV infection. Your doctor will recommend treatments to manage your symptoms and help you feel better. EBV reactivation symptoms The virus can wake up after it has been dormant in your body and cause symptoms again. This is more likely to happen if you have a weak immune system . Symptoms of EBV reactivation include: Fever Sore throat Swollen glands in the neck Swollen liver or spleen Tiredness See your doctor if you or your child has any of these symptoms a few months after an EBV infection. What You Can Do at Home Although no medicine can cure an EBV infection, you can take these steps at home to ease your symptoms: Get plenty of rest. Drink a lot of water and other liquids to stay hydrated. Suck on lozenges or ice pops, or gargle with warm salt water, to make your sore throat feel better. Take over-the-counter medications like acetaminophen or ibuprofen if you have a fever or body aches. (Don't give aspirin to children under 19 years of age because of the risk of a rare but serious condition called Reye’s syndrome.) Ease back into work or school, and take things slowly until you feel better. For a month or so, avoid sports, heavy lifting, or other vigorous activities that could injure your spleen. Is there an EBV diet? No diet is proven to treat EBV. It’s always a good idea to eat nutritious meals full of antioxidant-rich foods like leafy green vegetables and berries to strengthen your immune system. Drink lots of fluids to keep you hydrated. Caffeine and Epstein-Barr You may want to avoid caffeinated drinks while you have an EBV infection. One reason is that non-caffeinated drinks like water hydrate you better. Also, drinking a lot of coffee has been linked to a higher risk of stomach cancer from EBV. The risk is very small overall – only 8% to 10% of stomach cancers test positive for EBV. Still, it may be a good idea to cut back on caffeine if you drink a lot of it. EBV Vaccine No vaccine can protect you against the Epstein-Barr virus, but that might change in the future. The National Institutes of Health has launched a study of a possible vaccine to protect against EBV infection. They should have results by 2026. Another vaccine that researchers are studying produced a strong immune response against EBV in mice. Whether it will work in humans still has to be proved. Right now, the best way to avoid the virus is to stay away from anyone who you know is infected, and especially someone who has mono. Try these EBV prevention tips: Avoid kissing an infected person. Don’t share food or drinks with someone who has the virus. Don't share personal items like glasses, silverware, and toothbrushes with someone who's infected. Use protection if you have sex with someone who has the virus. Wash your hands after you touch anything that has contacted the saliva of an infected person. When to See Your Doctor There are some rare complications of EBV, so see your doctor if you or your child has any of these symptoms: Sudden, sharp pain on the left side of the belly, which could mean a problem with your spleen Very little urine, a sign of dehydration Trouble breathing or swallowing – call 911 right away Also call if your symptoms don't go away after 4-6 weeks. You could have another type of infection . Other Diseases Caused by EBV EBV is best known for causing mononucleosis, but less often it can lead to other diseases, including: Ear infections and diarrhea in children Guillain-Barre syndrome Certain cancers, including Burkitt's lymphoma and cancers of the nose and throat Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD), a rare complication of people who get organ and stem cell transplants Epstein-Barr virus and MS There may also be a link between EBV and the autoimmune disease multiple sclerosis (MS). Studies show that people who’ve had an EBV infection are at much higher risk of MS than those who’ve never been infected. Overall, the risk is still small. About 95% of adults eventually get an EBV infection, but very few get MS. More research is needed to show whether the virus does lead to MS. Takeaways Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is one of the most common human viruses. It spreads through bodily fluids like saliva and is very contagious. EBV is best known for causing mononucleosis. Symptoms are similar to the flu and include a sore throat, fever, and fatigue. Once you're infected with EBV, the virus stays in your body forever. Epstein-Barr Virus FAQs Does Epstein-Barr virus ever go away? If you're having symptoms from an infection from EBV, you should get better within a few weeks. But once you're infected with the Epstein-Barr virus, it stays in your body forever. It can be triggered by something like stress, and you can have symptoms again. How serious is Epstein-Barr virus? Most of the time, it's not very serious. If you have symptoms, you won't feel good and shouldn't go to work or school because it's very contagious. In rare cases, it can cause some types of cancer and other diseases."
40,Fifth Disease,"What Is Fifth Disease? Fifth disease, or erythema infectiosum, is a contagious viral infection common among school-age children. It’s most common during late winter, spring, and early summer. About 50% of adults are immune to fifth disease because they had it in childhood, often without knowing it. There is no vaccine for it. Fifth disease got its name many years ago when it was the fifth on a list of the six recognized childhood rash-forming illnesses. The others are rubella, measles, scarlet fever, chickenpox, and roseola infantum. Fifth Disease Symptoms In children, symptoms of fifth disease often start out like a cold. Then, within 7 to 10 days, a rash usually develops. Common symptoms of fifth disease include: Mild fever Stuffy or runny nose Headache Bright red cheeks A flat or raised red rash, usually on the arms and legs, which lasts from 2 to 39 days and may itch; the rash fades from the center of the red areas toward the edges, giving it a lacy appearance. The rash can recur with exercise, warm baths, rubbing the skin, or emotional upset. The most recognized sign of fifth disease is the red rash across the cheeks that looks as if the child has been slapped. You might also hear it called slapped-cheek disease. But not all children with fifth disease get the rash. It’s less common, but some kids also have: Sore throat Joint pain Swollen glands Red eyes Diarrhea Rash that looks like bruises or blisters The disease is rare in infants and adults. Adults usually don’t get a rash, but they do tend to get more serious flu-like symptoms, including: Headache Sore throat Muscle pain Joint pain, particularly in the hands, wrists, knees, and ankles Belly pain Fever Fifth Disease Causes Fifth disease is caused by parvovirus B19. This parvovirus only infects humans. Other forms of the virus can infect dogs and cats. Fifth Disease Transmission Fifth disease is spread through blood and by respiratory droplets that enter the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Adults who work with young children – such as child care providers, teachers, and health care workers – are most likely to be exposed. By the time the rash appears, children are no longer contagious and may attend school or day care. The incubation period (the time between infection and signs or symptoms of illness) is usually 4-14 days, but it can be as long as 21 days. Fifth Disease Prevention To limit the spread of fifth disease among children at home or in a child care setting, take the following steps: Wash hands often, especially after wiping or blowing noses and before preparing or eating food. Don't share food, pacifiers, bottles, eating utensils, or drinking cups. If toys tend to end up in tots' mouths, clean and disinfect them often. Don't kiss children on the mouth. Play outdoors as much as possible. It's easier for the virus to spread indoors where people are likely to be in closer contact. Make sure kids are not crowded together, especially during nap time. Teach children to cough or sneeze into a tissue (which should be thrown out right away) or the inside of their elbow (which is less likely than their hands to spread the virus) and away from other people. Children with fifth disease generally don't need to be excluded from day care , as they're unlikely to be contagious after the rash appears and a diagnosis has been made. Pregnancy and fifth disease If you don't have immunity to fifth disease and are pregnant, take steps to avoid infection. For instance, if there's an outbreak of fifth disease in your workplace, discuss with your doctor whether to stay home from work until it subsides. At home, wash your hands thoroughly after touching tissues used by infected children and dispose of these tissues promptly. Avoid sharing drinking glasses or utensils with anyone who has the illness or was exposed to it. Some doctors recommend giving immunoglobulin if you're pregnant and have been exposed to the virus. Fifth Disease Diagnosis In most cases, fifth disease is diagnosed based on the appearance of typical symptoms. A blood test can confirm whether you have fifth disease, but this usually is not necessary if you have a healthy immune system. If you're pregnant and you've been exposed to fifth disease, you may be given a blood test to determine whether you had it in the past and are, therefore, immune. If you get fifth disease while you're pregnant, either an amniocentesis or a test called percutaneous umbilical blood sampling (PUBS) can be used to test for the virus in your baby and find out how severe fetal anemia is, if it exists. Fifth disease can affect how your body or your baby's body makes red blood cells and cause severe anemia, although this is rare. Ultrasound can look for complications in your unborn baby, such as abnormal pooling of fluid around the heart, lungs, or belly. But most of the time, fifth disease doesn't cause your baby any problems. Fifth Disease Treatment The goal of fifth disease treatment is to ease symptoms and make you or your child more comfortable. There’s no specific medicine to treat the virus that causes fifth disease. Your doctor might suggest: Acetaminophen to help lower fever Ibuprofen for joint or muscle pain Antihistamines to treat itching that may come with the rash If you have sickle cell anemia, chronic anemia, or an impaired immune system, you can get a shot of immunoglobulin to fight off the virus. You may also need transfusions of red blood cells. Fifth Disease Complications Fifth disease is usually mild for otherwise healthy kids and adults and poses little risk to health. But it can cause chronic anemia in some people. You could need a blood transfusion, which would require a hospital stay. You’re more likely to have serious complications from fifth disease if you have a weakened immune system. Conditions that can weaken your immune system include leukemia and other cancers, HIV infection, and organ transplants. If you’re pregnant and think you may have the virus, call your doctor. Babies in utero don’t usually get the virus if their mother has it, and it hasn’t been shown to cause birth defects. But if a fetus does become infected, the virus can make it less able to produce red blood cells, leading to a dangerous form of anemia, heart failure, and sometimes miscarriage or stillbirth. A woman who gets the virus while pregnant has about a 2% chance of miscarriage. When to Call Your Doctor About Fifth Disease You should make that call to your doctor when: Your child has sickle cell anemia, any other chronic anemia or an impaired immune system and has been exposed to fifth disease or is showing symptoms. You're pregnant, you don't know whether you're immune to parvovirus B19 (or know that you are not immune), and you come into contact with anyone who has an infection with parvovirus B19. The rash becomes purple, painful, blistered, or lasts longer than 5 weeks. Your infected child looks or acts very ill."
41,Autoimmune Blistering Disorders,"What Are Autoimmune Blistering Disorders? Autoimmune blistering disorders (also called autoimmune blistering diseases or autoimmune bullous disorders) are a group of rare skin diseases. They happen when your immune system attacks your skin and mucous membranes -- the lining inside your mouth , nose, and other parts of your body. This causes blisters to form. Researchers have found many types of this disorder. Although there's no cure for them, your doctor can give you treatments to help heal the blisters and prevent complications. Types of Autoimmune Blistering Disorders Autoimmune blistering disorders are broken down into different types. These are some of the main ones: Pemphigus is a group of disorders that cause blisters to form on the skin and inside the mouth , nose, throat, eyes, and genitals. They are soft and can break open easily. Pemphigoid is another group. It has three main types: Bullous pemphigoid usually affects people between the ages of 60 and 80. It causes itchy blisters to form on the arms, thighs, and belly. Mucous membrane pemphigoid affects the lining of the mouth, eyes , nose, throat, and genitals. Pemphigoid gestationis affects women during pregnancy or just after their baby is born. It starts as a bumpy rash on the belly, arms, and legs. Then the bumps turn into blisters. IgA mediated bullous dermatoses are disorders in which the immune system makes a lot of immunoglobulin A (IgA), a type of antibody that fights bacteria, toxins, and viruses. It comes in two types: Dermatitis herpetiformis affects people with celiac disease (who are sensitive to the wheat protein called gluten ). It causes clusters of itchy blisters to appear on the elbows, knees, scalp, and buttocks. Linear IgA disease causes new blisters to form a ring around old ones on the skin. This is sometimes called a “cluster of jewels.” This type affects mucous membranes, too. Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita mostly affects middle-aged and older adults. It makes the skin so fragile that blisters form from minor injuries. Autoimmune Blistering Disorder Symptoms The places on your body where blisters form depends on which disorder you have. Some autoimmune blistering disorders cause blisters to grow on the skin. Other types cause them to form in the mucous membranes that line the mouth, nose, throat, eyes , and genitals. They can be painful or itchy. They can break open and leave a sore. Autoimmune Blistering Disorder Causes When your immune system is working as it should, it attacks bacteria and other invaders before they can make you sick. In autoimmune blistering disorders, your system mistakes healthy cells in your skin and mucous membranes for unwanted intruders. Erythema multiforme minor appears as symmetrical rings of red, raised skin that look like targets. Erythema multiforme can appear anywhere on the body. It is most often caused by the herpes simplex virus but has been associated with fungal infections or reactions to medications. Your immune system makes proteins called antibodies. These attack the substances that hold the outer (epidermis) and inner (dermis) layers of skin together. The damage causes the two layers of skin to separate. Fluid collects between the two and forms blisters. Doctors don't know what causes the immune system to misfire. Some people have genes that make them more likely to get one of these disorders. Then, something actually triggers it, such as: Ultraviolet light from the sun Chemicals used to kill pests Hormones Infection Some medicines can also cause autoimmune blistering disorders. These include: Diuretics and other medicines for high blood pressure Rheumatoid arthritis medications Antipsychotic medicines Antibiotics such as amoxicillin ( Moxatag ), ciprofloxacin (Cetraxal, Ciloxan, Cipro ), and penicillin Usually, the blisters go away once you stop taking the medicine causing them. Autoimmune Blistering Disorder Complications Blisters can cause long-term problems if they form in certain parts of the body or break open. Blisters that pop open can cause infections. After they heal, they can leave scars. In the throat or lungs , they can make it hard to eat, swallow, or breathe . In the mouth, they can cause gum disease and tooth loss. In the eyes , they can affect sight. Autoimmune Blistering Disorder Diagnosis You'll see a dermatologist. They will look at your skin and see where the blisters have formed. You might get one or more of these tests: Blister biopsy . Your doctor removes a piece of the blister and looks at it under a microscope. A biopsy can show where the skin layers have separated. Direct immunofluorescence. A chemical is placed on the skin biopsy sample. Then it is tested for antibodies. The type of antibodies in your skin can show which type of blistering disorder you have. Blood test. Your doctor tests a sample of your blood for antibodies. This test can show how severe your condition is. It can also help the doctor see whether treatment is working. Sometimes it’s hard to tell the difference between autoimmune blistering disorders and other conditions, including: Genetic blistering disease, a group of disorders caused by changes in a gene needed for healthy skin Grover’s disease, a rare skin disorder that can cause small red lesions and blisters Other skin conditions that cause blisters, such as erythema multiforme or impetigo Autoimmune Blistering Disorder Treatment Your doctor will decide on a treatment based on your symptoms. Medicines for these disorders lower the immune system response and prevent it from attacking your skin and mucous membranes. Treatments might include prescriptions from these classes of drugs: Corticosteroids , such as prednisone ( Deltasone , Prednicot, Rayos), that also ease inflammation Immunosuppressive medicines , such as azathioprine ( Azasan , Imuran ), cyclophosphamide , or mycophenolate mofetil (CellCept) Biologic drugs, such as rituximab ( Rituxan ), also used in some cancer treatments For more serious cases, your treatments might include: Intravenous immunoglobulin G ( IVIG ). This is a blood product you get through a needle into a vein. IVIG is an antibody found in plasma -- the liquid part of blood. It's taken from thousands of donors and pooled together. IVIG treatment gives you healthy antibodies to take over for the unhealthy ones that caused your disorder. Plasmapheresis . This treatment removes the harmful antibodies from your blood. The part of blood that's removed is replaced with blood from a donor that contains healthy antibodies. Blisters that pop open can get infected. These drugs help prevent an infection: Antibiotics Antiviral drugs Antifungal drugs Autoimmune Blistering Disorder Home Care To prevent infections and help you stay more comfortable, take care of your blisters. Keep them clean the way your doctor recommends. Try not to pop them. This can leave scars. If a blister is in an uncomfortable place such as your foot , your doctor can release the fluid with a clean needle. Also: Wash your sheets, towels, and clothes often. Make sure everything that touches your skin is clean. Care for your teeth . If you have blisters in your mouth, ask your dentist how to brush your teeth and gums without causing pain and more damage. Each person with autoimmune blistering disorders is different. Some people have only mild blisters that go away on their own. Others have more severe skin problems that are harder to treat. Talk to your doctor about your situation. Try different treatments until you find one that works for you."
42,What Is Ewing's Sarcoma?,"Ewing’s Sarcoma Overview Ewing’s sarcoma is a rare type of cancerous tumor that grows in the bones or the soft tissue around the bones, such as cartilage. It is most common in children and young adults, but anyone can have it. Ewing’s sarcoma affects about 200 children and young adults every year in the United States. It's slightly more common in males than females. It mostly affects people of European descent and has rarely been found in people of African or Asian descent. Ewing's sarcoma vs. osteosarcoma Osteosarcoma is another type of cancerous bone tumor that mainly affects young people. It is more common than Ewing's sarcoma. Osteosarcoma usually grows in bones around the knee, and Ewing's sarcoma usually grows in the bones of the thighs, pelvis, ribs, and upper arms. These two types of bone cancer are treated in a similar way. Types of Ewing’s Sarcoma There are four types of Ewing's sarcomas based on the place where the tumor forms: Bone tumor: 87% of Ewing’s sarcomas are in the bone, usually the thigh bones, pelvis, ribs, or upper arms. But the tumor can grow in any bone. Soft tissue tumor: This type of tumor grows in the soft tissues around your child's bones, such as cartilage. Peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET): This type of tumor is found in the nerves and can grow in many areas of your child's body. Askin tumor: This is a type of PNET tumor that’s found in your child's chest wall. All types of Ewing's sarcoma can spread to other areas of your child's body, such as their bones, bone marrow, and lungs. Ewing's sarcoma often affects the bones of the pelvis. (Photo credit: Radiopedia) Causes of Ewing's Sarcoma Doctors don't know what causes Ewing's sarcoma. It doesn't run in families, and it’s not caused by anything related to diet, lifestyle, or environment. Research shows that changes in a cell's DNA that happen after your child's birth most likely lead to Ewing’s sarcoma. Scientists still don't understand why that happens. Symptoms of Ewing's Sarcoma With Ewing's sarcoma, your child may feel pain , swelling, or stiffness in the area of the tumor. This is sometimes mistaken for bumps and bruises from playing sports. Ewing's sarcoma might also cause your child to: Have a lump near the skin that feels warm and soft to the touch Have a constant low fever Limp because their legs hurt Have bone pain that gets worse when they exercise or during the night Have broken bones without an obvious cause Lose weight without trying Feel tired for no reason Diagnosis and Tests for Ewing's Sarcoma Your doctor has a number of tests to see whether your child has Ewing’s sarcoma. If they do, your doctor will also try to find out whether the tumor has spread. Physical exam : Your doctor will start out with this, especially checking around the painful areas for signs such as lumps, redness, and swelling. X-rays: These take an image of the area of your child's body where the tumor might be. If the X-rays show any problems, your doctor may order other imaging tests. Bone scan: This is used to find out whether cancer cells are in your child's bones. A small amount of radioactive dye is injected into your child's veins. The dye will collect in the bones that have tumors. When your child lies under a bone scanner, the doctor will be able to detect where the radioactive dye has gathered. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): For this test, your child lies flat and still on a surface inside a tube-shaped machine. It uses a magnetic field and radio waves to create a detailed 3D image of the inside of your child's body. Computed tomography scan (CT scan): Similar to the MRI, your child lies flat inside a CT scanner, which takes X-ray pictures while linked to a computer. CT scans are more detailed than X-rays but not as detailed as MRIs. Positron emission tomography scan ( PET scan ): A technician injects a small amount of a radioactive sugar into your child's vein. Your child then lies inside the tube-like PET scanner machine. The cancer cells show up brighter in the scan because they use more sugar than healthy cells. Biopsy : Your doctor removes a small piece of tissue from your child's tumor. The sample is viewed under a microscope to see if it’s cancerous. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy: Your doctor takes a small piece of bone marrow from your child's bone to exam under a microscope. This is usually used to see if the cancer has spread. Treatments for Ewing's Sarcoma What kind of treatment your child has depends on: The size of their tumor Where it has spread Their overall health Your preferences, which you should talk over with your doctor Treatment options include: Chemotherapy : This is usually the first step. During chemotherapy, you're child takes medication either by pill or shot to shrink the tumor. Your child's doctor may use more than one type of chemotherapy at a time or combine this with surgery and radiation. Surgery: Surgery usually follows chemotherapy. Your doctor will try to remove the tumor to stop its spread. In some cases, they may have to remove an arm or leg if the tumor has spread a lot. Radiation: In this therapy , a technician will use X-rays and other types of radiation to kill the cancer cells. E wing's sarcoma radiology can be done using machines outside the body to deliver the dose, or through needles and tubes sent right to the tumor. Ewing's Sarcoma Survival Rate Survival rates for Ewing's sarcoma depend on if your child's cancer has spread. According to the American Cancer Society, if the cancer hasn't spread, your child has an 82% chance of living at least another 5 years. If the cancer has spread, the survival rate is between 39% and 71%, depending on how far it has spread. It's important to note that these are only estimates. As treatments improve, so do the survival rates. Ewing's sarcoma treatments have become much more effective in recent years. Your child will need follow-up care with your doctor for many years after treatment. There is a chance of recurrence, and the treatments for the cancer can have effects that show up later in your child's life."
43,COPD and Exercise: Breathing and Exercise Programs for COPD,"Exercise and Nutrition for COPD If you have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), it may be harder for you to eat well and to exercise. Your energy may be limited, making it harder to be physically active or to do things like prepare and eat meals. But exercise and good nutrition can help you live better with COPD. Learn why – and what you can do to stay healthier. How Exercise Can Help You Exercise – especially exercise that works your lungs and heart – has many benefits for people who have COPD. Exercise can: Improve how well your body uses oxygen. That’s important because people with COPD use more energy to breathe than other people do. Ease your symptoms and improve your breathing Strengthen your heart, lower your blood pressure , and improve your circulation Improve your energy, making it possible to stay more active Improve your sleep and make you feel more relaxed Help you maintain a healthy weight Enhance your mental and emotional outlook Reduce your social isolation , if you exercise with others Strengthen your bones 4 Types of Exercises for COPD These four types of exercise can help you if you have COPD. How much you focus on each type depends on the COPD exercise program your health care provider suggests for you. Stretching exercises lengthen your muscles, making you more flexible. Aerobic exercises use large muscle groups to move at a steady, rhythmic pace. This type of exercise works your heart and lungs , improving their endurance. This helps your body use oxygen better and, with time, can improve your breathing. Walking and using a stationary bike are two good aerobic exercises if you have COPD. Strengthening exercises involve tightening muscles until they begin to tire. When you do this for the upper body, it can help increase the strength of your breathing muscles. Breathing exercises for COPD help you strengthen breathing muscles, get more oxygen, and breathe with less effort. Here are two examples of breathing exercises you can begin practicing. Work up to 5 to 10 minutes, three to four times a day. Pursed-lip breathing: Relax your neck and shoulder muscles. Breathe in for 2 seconds through your nose, keeping your mouth closed. Breathe out for 4 seconds through pursed lips. If this is too long for you, simply breathe out for twice as long as you breathe in. Use pursed-lip breathing while exercising. If you have shortness of breath, try slowing your rate of breathing and focus on breathing out through pursed lips. Diaphragmatic breathing: Lie on your back with knees bent. You can put a pillow under your knees for support. Place one hand on your belly below your rib cage. Place the other hand on your chest. Inhale deeply through your nose for a count of three. Your belly and lower ribs should rise, but your chest should remain still. Tighten your stomach muscles and exhale for a count of six through slightly puckered lips. Other Breathing Techniques for COPD When you have COPD, shortness of breath may be a daily and unwelcome fact of life. Perhaps your doctor is urging you to enter a pulmonary rehabilitation program to help you manage your disease better. Some pulmonary rehab programs use breathing devices, called inspiratory muscle trainers, that train patients to increase the pressure that breathing muscles have to generate per breath. Pulmonary rehab programs also teach patients exercises to strengthen their arms and legs. Typically, patients do aerobic and isotonic exercises, the latter designed to strengthen muscles. COPD and Exercise Guidelines Set realistic goals. Slowly increase the number of minutes and days you exercise . A good goal is to exercise 20 to 40 minutes, two to four times a week. Start out slow. Warm up for a few minutes. Choose activities you enjoy, and vary them to help you stay motivated. Find an exercise partner. Keep a record of your exercise to help you stay on track. As you end your exercise, cool down by moving more slowly. COPD and Exercise Precautions It's good to be careful when exercising with COPD, but remember that shortness of breath doesn't always mean you should stop altogether. Ask your doctor about when you should stop exercising and rest. Here are other exercise precautions: Always consult a doctor or other health care provider before starting a COPD exercise program . If you have a change in any medications, talk to your doctor before continuing your exercise routine. Balance exercise with rest. If you feel tired, start at a lower level. If you feel very tired, rest and try again the next day. Wait at least an hour and a half after eating before beginning to exercise. When you drink fluids while exercising, remember any fluid restrictions you have. Avoid hot or cold showers after exercising. If you've been away from exercise for several days, start up slowly, and gradually return to your regular routine. Exercises to avoid when you have COPD: Heavy lifting or pushing Chores such as shoveling, mowing, or raking Pushups, situps, or isometric exercises, which involve pushing against immovable objects Outdoor exercises when the weather is very cold, hot, or humid Walking up steep hills Ask your doctor whether exercises like weightlifting, jogging , and swimming are OK for you to do. COPD and Exercise: When to Stop If you have any of these signs or symptoms, stop your COPD exercise program right away. Sit down, and keep your feet raised while resting. If you don't feel better right away, call 911. Even if you do feel better, make sure you tell your doctor right away about any of these symptoms: Nausea Dizziness Weakness Rapid or irregular heartbeat Severe shortness of breath Pain Pressure or pain in your chest, arm, neck, jaw, or shoulder How a Healthy Diet Can Help You If you have COPD, your respiratory muscles burn 10 times as many calories as those of other people. That’s because it takes so much energy just for you to breathe. On top of that, you may take medications or have depression that can reduce your appetite. A healthy diet can help manage your condition and help you feel better. Here are three reasons why: 1. If you don't get enough calories and are underweight: You may be more likely to get an infection. You may become weak and tired more often. The muscles that control your breathing may weaken. 2. If you're overweight : Your heart and lungs must work harder. Your body may demand more oxygen. Your breathing may become more difficult, especially if you carry weight around your middle. 3. When you have COPD, a diet full of healthy foods: Helps you maintain a healthy weight Provides your body the energy it needs Supplies enough calories, keeping breathing and other muscles strong Helps your body fight infections by strengthening your immune system When you have COPD, you may need to make some diet changes. But always do this under the guidance of a registered dietitian or other health care provider who can prepare a nutrition action plan tailored to your exact needs. COPD and Diet Here are a few COPD and diet guidelines to get started: Eat a variety of healthy foods such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, dairy products, and proteins. High-fiber foods are especially important. They help with digestion, control blood sugar levels, reduce cholesterol levels, and can help control weight. Drink plenty of water. Not only does it help prevent gas when you eat high-fiber foods, but water helps thin mucus so you can cough it up easier. Most people need six to eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day. Check with your doctor, though, because some health conditions require that you limit your fluids. Choose decaffeinated and noncarbonated beverages. Limit alcohol, which can interact with medications, can slow breathing, and may make it harder to cough up mucus. Ask about certain foods. Certain nutrients, such as omega-3 fatty acids, may help reduce inflammation and improve lung function. Ask your doctor. Avoid salt. Salt (sodium) makes your body retain water, which increases swelling. This makes it harder to breathe. To get less salt, try to: Read food labels and choose foods with fewer than 300 milligrams (mg) of sodium per serving. Use no-salt spices. Avoid adding salt while cooking. Avoid foods that cause gas or bloating . Everyone knows how uncomfortable that full-stomach feeling is. And it may make it harder to breathe. To ease gas or bloating, avoid foods and drinks such as: Beans, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, and cauliflower Carbonated beverages Fried, spicy, or greasy foods Avoid empty foods. Junk foods such as chips and candy don't provide any nutritional value. If you need to gain weight, choose more high-protein, high-calorie foods such as cheese, peanut butter, eggs, milk, and yogurt. Ask about nutritional supplements to increase the number of calories and nutrients you get each day. COPD and Easier Eating If you have COPD, mealtime can feel like a chore. Try these tips for easier eating: Conserve energy: Choose foods that are easier to prepare. It's more important to eat than to prepare fancy foods. Get help with meal preparation. Ask your family or friends for help, or check with local government agencies or church organizations about meal deliveries. Many are low-cost; some are free. Freeze extra portions and take them out when you're very tired. Eat your main meals earlier in the day, when you have extra energy . Breathe easier at mealtime: Eat sitting up, not lying down. This prevents extra pressure on your lungs. If you use continuous oxygen, wear your cannula while eating to provide the energy your body needs for eating and digestion . Take small bites, chew slowly, and breathe deeply while chewing. Choose easy-to-chew foods. Eat smaller, more frequent meals. Drink fluids at the end of the meal so you don't fill up too fast. Stimulate your appetite: Keep healthy foods visible and within easy reach. Eat a variety of healthy foods, especially your favorites. Use colorful place settings or play background music while eating. Eat with other people as often as you can. Walk or do light exercises. How to Monitor Your Weight With COPD To help monitor and maintain a healthy weight if you have COPD: Weigh yourself once or twice a week, or as often as your doctor suggests. If you take water pills, called diuretics, you should weigh yourself every day. Contact your doctor if you gain or lose 2 pounds in a day or 5 pounds in a week. Make changes in your diet under the guidance of a health care professional. If you need to lose weight, ask about special exercises that may also strengthen your chest muscles."
44,What Can I Do for My Plantar Fasciitis?,"With plantar fasciitis , you suffer from chronic pain in the bottom of your heel or the bottom of your foot .  While it may feel like inflammation, it is associated with a degenerative problem involving the tissue that connects your toes to your heel bone. Plantar fasciitus happens a lot with runners and people who have flat feet, high arches, are overweight , or who are on their feet a lot. It can take 6-12 months for your foot to get back to normal. You can do these things at home to ease the pain and help your foot heal faster: Rest: It's important to keep weight off your foot until the inflammation goes down. Ice: This is an easy way to treat inflammation, and there are a few ways you can use it. To make an ice pack, wrap a towel around a plastic bag filled with crushed ice or around a package of frozen corn or peas. Put it on your heel 3 to 4 times a day for 15 to 20 minutes at a time. Or you can fill a shallow pan with water and ice and soak your heel in it for 10 to 15 minutes a few times a day. Be sure to keep your toes out of the water. Another option is to fill a small paper or foam cup with water and freeze it. Then rub it over your heel for 5 to 10 minutes or until your heel is numb. Pain relievers: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) can make your foot feel better and help with inflammation. Stretching and exercise : Stretch your calves , Achilles tendon , and the bottom of your foot. Do exercises that make your hips, lower leg, and foot muscles stronger. This can help stabilize your ankle , ease pain, and keep plantar fasciitis from coming back. Athletic tape: Tape can support your foot and keep you from moving it in a way that makes plantar fasciitis worse. Shoe inserts. Also called insoles, arch supports, or orthotics, they can give you extra cushion and added support. You can get them over-the-counter (OTC) or have them custom made. Typically, your results will be just as good, and cheaper, with OTC inserts. When you choose one, firmer is better -- and make sure it has good arch support. You might also see advertisements for magnetic insoles to help with plantar fasciitis. Research has generally shown that these don't work. Heel cups . With each step you take, your heel pounds the ground and puts tension on your plantar fascia. These heel-shaped pads that go in your shoes may help. They raise your heel to relieve tension and give you extra cushion. They often don't work as well as inserts, but they're a cheap option to try. Night splints . Most of us sleep with our feet pointed down, which shortens the plantar fascia and Achilles tendon. Night splints, which you wear while you sleep, keep your feet at a 90-degree angle. So instead of shortening your plantar fascia, you get a good, constant stretch while you sleep. They can be bulky, but they tend to work really well. And once the pain is gone, you can stop wearing them. Walking cast or boot . Typically, your doctor would suggest a walking cast or boot -- called a controlled ankle motion (CAM) walker -- only when other treatments have failed. The cast or CAM walker forces you to rest your foot, which can help relieve pain. But it's not a cure. When the cast comes off, the pain may return. That means you'll need other treatments too, like insoles and stretching. Can You Prevent Plantar Fasciitis? Once your foot feels better, you can make a few lifestyle changes to help keep plantar fasciitis from coming back. These include: Lose weight . If you're overweight or obese , you may put more pressure on the bottom of your feet. That pressure can lead to plantar fasciitis. Choose shoes with good support. Replace your athletic shoes often. Stay away from high heels. Don't go barefoot on hard surfaces. This includes your first few steps when you get up in the morning. It's common to feel plantar fasciitis then. So you'll want to keep some supportive footwear by your bed. You may also want to ask your doctor if it would help to wear inserts in your shoes. Do low-impact exercise . Activities like swimming or cycling won't cause plantar fasciitis or make it worse. After you're done, stretch out your calves and feet. For instance, curl and relax your toes and make circles with your feet and ankles. Avoid high-impact activities. These include running and jumping, which put a lot of stress on your feet and can make your calf muscles tighter if you don't stretch them out. Keep doing your leg and foot stretches. Two of these include: Stretch your calves. Stand facing a wall. Put your hands on the wall. Step one foot behind the other, keeping both feet parallel to each other. Gently lean toward the wall, keeping your back heel on the ground. Hold for 10 seconds, and then switch feet. Repeat several times on each side. Stretch the bottom of your foot. Sit down and cross one foot over your other leg. Hold your toes and gently bend them backward. Untuck your bedsheets. If your sheets are tucked too tightly and you sleep on your back, your feet will be in a pointed position while you sleep ."
45,How You Can Exercise to Help Prevent Heart Disease,"Regular exercise , especially aerobic exercise , is one of the best things you can do for yourself. It helps cut your chances of getting heart disease . It's good for your blood pressure , cholesterol , weight , energy level, and mood, too. If you're not active now, check with your doctor before you start. They’ll let you know what you can do safely. Ask about things like push-ups and sit-ups. These involve straining muscles against other muscles or a heavy object. You may need to avoid them. Make sure that lifting and pushing heavy objects, and chores like raking, shoveling, mowing, and scrubbing, aren't off-limits. Chores around the house can drain some people. Do only what you can do without getting tired . If you take any prescription medicines, ask them if you need to adjust them when you start exercising . How Often and How Long Should I Exercise? If you're not active now, gradually work up to an aerobic session of about 20 to 30 minutes, at least three or four times a week. While the more exercise you can do, the better, any amount is good for you. What Type of Exercise Should I Do? Anything that raises your heart rate counts. Think about what you need. For instance, if you're looking for something easy on your joints, consider walking and swimming . Don’t forget to think about what would be fun, too. Maybe you could do something you used to do or something you've always wanted to try. What’s convenient for you is important, too. Do you need an at-home workout? Would you go to a gym if you joined? How about joining a recreational sports team, hiking group, or dance class? You're more likely to stick with it if you enjoy it. Here are some tips to help you make exercise a regular part of your routine: Ban boredom. Pick a variety of activities that you like. Don't do the same thing over and over. Make playlists. Use music to keep you entertained. Commit. You won't always feel like it, and you'll find all sorts of excuses not to do it. You'll need to make a decision ahead of time and ignore that impulse and exercise anyway. Socialize. Working out is more fun if you have a friend with you. Stay within your budget. Don’t buy expensive equipment or health club memberships unless you know you’ll use them. What to Do in Every Workout Each exercise session should include a warm-up, conditioning phase, and a cool down. Warm-up: Go easy for a few minutes as your body gets used to what you're asking it to do. Conditioning: This is the main part of your workout. Cool down: You're transitioning out of your workout. Don’t sit, stand still, or lie down right after exercise, or you may feel dizzy or lightheaded or have heart palpitations (fluttering in your chest). The best cool-down is to ease up on the intensity of your activity. Workout Tips Pace yourself. Don't do too much too soon. Give your body time to rest between workouts. Don't exercise outdoors when it's too cold, hot, or humid. High humidity may make you tired more quickly. Extreme temperatures can interfere with circulation, make breathing difficult, and cause chest pain . Indoor activities such as mall walking are better choices. Stay hydrated. Drink water even before you feel thirsty, especially on hot days. Skip extremely hot and cold showers or sauna baths after exercise. These extreme temperatures make your heart work harder. Resume slowly after a break. If your regular exercise gets interrupted for a few days (because you were sick, went on vacation, or had bad weather, for example), ease back into it. Start with shorter and less intense activity, and gradually build up until you're back to the level you were before. How Hard Should I Work? A cardio workout is moderate if you can talk but not sing. You're exercising vigorously if you can't say more than a few words without taking a breath. Ask your doctor if you should limit the intensity of your exercise. It's much better to start out taking it easier and work up to more challenging workouts. That’ll help prevent injury. What to Watch For Don't exercise if you're not feeling well or have a fever . People with heart problems should wait until all symptoms disappear before you get back to your routine, unless your doctor gives other directions. Stop activity if you get a rapid or irregular heartbeat or have heart palpitations. Check your pulse after you've rested for 15 minutes. If it's still more than 100 beats per minute, call the doctor. Being too tired or short of breath is also a signal to stop. Tell your doctor what happened, or schedule an appointment. Does it hurt while exercising? Don't ignore it. Stop when you have pain anywhere in your body. You could injure your joints. Stop and rest if you: Feel weak Are dizzy or lightheaded Have unexplained weight gain or swelling -- call the doctor right away Feel pressure or pain in your chest, neck, arm, jaw, or shoulder Are concerned for any reason Call the doctor if those feelings don't go away."
46,Exercise to Treat Arthritis,"Although arthritis treatment usually includes medication , a tailored arthritis exercise program can help relieve pain and fatigue and preserve joint structure and function. The stiffness, pain, and swelling associated with arthritis can severely reduce the range of motion of joints (the distance joints can move in certain directions). Avoiding physical activity because of pain or discomfort also can lead to significant muscle loss and excessive weight gain . Exercise, as part of a comprehensive arthritis treatment plan, can improve joint mobility, muscle strength, and overall physical conditioning, and help you maintain a healthy weight. Once you know what type of arthritis you have and understand your symptoms, you and your doctor or physical therapist can develop a balanced program of physical activity to reduce the damaging effects of arthritis and promote optimal health. What Are the Benefits of Exercise as an Arthritis Treatment? A tailored program that includes a balance of three types of exercises -- range-of-motion, strengthening, and endurance -- can relieve the symptoms of arthritis and protect joints from further damage. Exercise also may: Help maintain normal joint movement Increase muscle flexibility and strength Help maintain weight to reduce pressure on joints Help keep bone and cartilage tissue strong and healthy Improve endurance and cardiovascular fitness What Are Range-of-Motion Exercises? To help relieve pain, people with arthritis often keep their affected joints bent -- especially those in the knees , hands, and fingers -- because it's more comfortable in that position. Although this may temporarily relieve discomfort, holding a joint in the same position for too long can cause permanent loss of mobility and further hinder the ability to perform daily activities. Range-of-motion exercises (also called stretching or flexibility exercises) help maintain normal joint function by increasing and preserving joint mobility and flexibility. In this group of exercises, gently straightening and bending the joints in a controlled manner as far as they comfortably will go can help condition the affected joints. During the course of a range-of-motion exercise program, the joints are stretched progressively farther until normal or near-normal range is achieved and maintained. This helps to maintain comfort while function is preserved. In addition to preserving joint function, range-of-motion exercises are an important form of warm-up and stretching , and should be done prior to performing strengthening or endurance exercises, or engaging in any other physical activity. A doctor or physical therapist can provide you with instructions on how to perform range-of-motion exercises. Why Should I Also Do Strengthening Exercises? Strong muscles help keep weak joints stable and comfortable and protect them against further damage. A program of strengthening exercises that targets specific muscle groups can be helpful as part of your arthritis treatment. There are several types of strengthening exercises that, when performed properly, can maintain or increase muscle tissue to support your muscles without aggravating your joints. Some people with arthritis avoid exercise because of joint pain . However, a group of exercises called ""isometrics"" will help strengthen muscles without bending painful joints. Isometrics involve no joint movement but rather strengthen muscle groups by using an alternating series of isolated muscle flexes and periods of relaxation. Isotonics is another group of exercises that involve joint mobility. However, this group of exercises is more intensive, achieving strength development through increased repetitions or by introducing increasing weight resistance such as with small dumbbells or stretch bands. A physical therapist or fitness instructor (preferably one who has experience working with people with arthritis) can tell you how to safely and effectively perform isometric and isotonic exercises. What Is Hydrotherapy? Hydrotherapy, also called ""aqua therapy"" (water therapy), is a program of exercises performed in a large pool. Aqua therapy may be easier on joints because the buoyancy of water takes some of the weight off the painful joints while providing resistance training. What Are Endurance Exercises? The foundation of endurance training is aerobic exercise, which includes any activity that increases the heart rate for a prolonged period of time. Aerobic activity conditions the heart and lungs to: Use oxygen to more efficiently supply the entire body with larger amounts of oxygen-rich blood Build stronger muscles for endurance activity When paired with a healthy diet, aerobic activity also is fundamental for controlling weight (which is important for people with arthritis since it reduces excess pressure on affected joints) and for improving overall general health. At first, people with arthritis should perform about 15 to 20 minutes of aerobic activity at least three times a week, and then gradually build up to 30 minutes daily. The activity also should include at least five to 10 minutes of warm-up plus five to 10 minutes of cool-down. Although peak benefits are achieved when an aerobic activity is performed continuously for at least 30 minutes, aerobic exercise can be spread out in smaller segments of time throughout the day to suit your comfort level, without overexerting yourself. Aerobic exercise should be performed at a comfortable, steady pace that allows you to talk normally and easily during the activity. Ask your therapist what intensity of exercise is appropriate for your fitness level. During exercise, your heart 's ""training range,"" or target heart rate, should be closely monitored. To improve your body's aerobic condition, you should calculate your maximum heart rate -- 220 minus your age -- and exercise at a level of intensity between 60% and 80% of your maximum heart rate. Examples of aerobic activities include walking, swimming , low-impact aerobic dance, skiing, and biking, and may even include such daily activities as mowing the lawn, raking leaves, or playing golf. Walking is one of the easiest aerobic exercises to begin because it requires no special skills or equipment other than a good pair of supportive walking shoes, and it's less stressful on joints than running or jogging . Biking is another good choice for people with arthritis, because it places less stress on knee , foot, and ankle joints. Swimming is also often recommended because there is minimal pressure on joints while in water. Appropriate recreational exercise, including sports, can be helpful to most people with arthritis. These activities are best preceded by a program of range-of-motion and strength exercises to reduce the chance of injury. How Do I Begin Exercising? Regardless of your condition, discuss exercise options with a doctor before beginning any new exercise program. People with arthritis who are beginning a new exercise program should spend some time conditioning with a program that consists of only range-of-motion and strengthening exercises, depending on their physical condition and level of fitness. Endurance exercises should be added gradually, and only after you feel comfortable with your current fitness level. As with any change in lifestyle, your body will need time to adapt to your new program. During the first few weeks, you may notice changes in the way your muscles feel, your sleep patterns, or energy levels. These changes are to be expected with increased activity. However, improper exercise levels or programs may be harmful, making symptoms of arthritis worse. Check with your doctor and adjust your program if you experience any of the following: Unusual or persistent fatigue Sharp or increased pain Increased weakness Decreased range of motion Increased joint swelling Continuing pain Regardless of the exercise program you select, it's important to begin slowly and choose a program you enjoy so that you maintain it. Make exercise part of your daily routine so that it becomes a lifetime habit."
47,What Is Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency?,"Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) causes problems in how you digest food. Your pancreas doesn't make enough of the enzymes that your body needs to break down and absorb nutrients. Enzymes speed up chemical reactions in your body. The enzymes made by your pancreas move into your small intestine, where they help break down the food you eat. When you have EPI, you don't get the nutrition you need because your body can't absorb fats and some vitamins and minerals from foods. You might lose weight or have pain in your belly. There are drugs that work for most people that give you a new supply of enzymes, so you can go back to digesting food the right way. Besides taking medicine, you can manage your symptoms by making sure you follow the right diet . Your doctor will recommend foods that will help you get enough nutrients and protein that you might be missing. What Causes EPI? Damage to your pancreas causes EPI. There are many reasons this can happen but some of the most common are: Your pancreas gets inflamed often . Doctors call this chronic pancreatitis. It happens when the enzymes made by the pancreas start working while they're still inside it, before they get to the small intestine. You're at risk for this if you're a heavy drinker, though there can be other causes as well. For instance, your pancreas could get inflamed if some passageways in it are blocked or if you have very high levels of triglycerides (a type of blood fat) or an immune system disorder . You've had surgery on your pancreas, stomach, or intestines. You have one of these inherited diseases: Cystic fibrosis Shwachman-Diamond syndrome If you have cystic fibrosis, your body makes unusually thick and sticky mucus. This mucus blocks passageways in your pancreas and stops enzymes from getting out. If you have Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, you may be missing cells in your pancreas that make enzymes. Crohn’s disease and celiac disease can also lead to EPI in some people. What Are the Symptoms of EPI? You may not have any symptoms at first. But once your pancreas gets so damaged that it starts to hurt your ability to absorb fat, you may get some symptoms, such as: Pain or tenderness in your belly Bad-smelling bowel movements Diarrhea Gas Feeling full You might also lose weight and get other problems, because your body doesn’t absorb enough vitamins. For instance, you could develop a bleeding disorder if you're not getting enough vitamin K . Or you could get bone pain if you don't get enough vitamin D . How Is EPI Diagnosed? Your doctor may diagnose your condition by checking your symptoms. They may ask you questions such as: Do you have pain in your upper belly? Have you had bad-smelling bowel movements that are oily and hard to flush down the toilet? Do you have gas or diarrhea? Have you lost weight? Several tests can help diagnose EPI. First, you may need some blood tests that check to see if you're getting enough vitamins and that your pancreas is making enough enzymes. Other blood tests can check for things that can lead to EPI, like celiac disease . You may also need to take the ""3-day fecal test."" It checks for the amount of fat in your bowel movements. You'll need to collect samples of your stool in special containers for 3 days. Your doctor may also ask you to take a test called ""fecal elastase-1."" For this, you also need to collect a sample of your bowel movement in a container. It will be sent to a lab to look for an enzyme that's important in digestion. The test can tell you if your pancreas is making enough of it. You may also need to get some tests that check to see if your pancreas is inflamed, including: CT scan . This uses a powerful X-ray to make detailed pictures inside your body. MRI. It uses strong magnets and radio waves to make pictures of organs and structures inside your body. Endoscopic ultrasound. This test uses sound waves to take pictures inside your digestive system. The sound waves are sent out by a thin tube that your doctor places through your mouth into your digestive system. Questions for Your Doctor When you find out you've got EPI, you'll probably have a lot of questions. You may want to start by asking your doctor: What caused this? What treatments do you recommend? Do I need to follow a special diet? Are there vitamins I should take? Can I drink alcohol? What can I do if I'm losing weight? How Is EPI Treated? Apart from a healthy diet, the main treatment for EPI is pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT). You take prescription pills that replace the enzymes your pancreas isn't making. These enzymes break down your food so you can more easily digest and absorb it. You have to take them during your meals. If you take them before you eat, the replacement enzymes may move through your stomach before your food gets there. If you take the pills after you eat, you have the opposite problem. You may also need to take an antacid to keep your stomach from breaking down pancreatic enzymes before they can start to work. There are six FDA-approved pancreatic enzyme products that are only available by prescription: Creon Pancreaze Pertzye Ultresa Viokace Zenpep If your doctor prescribes this medication, take it at the start of meals or before you eat snacks, along with a liquid like water. Don't dissolve the pill in a liquid like milk or take it with any over-the-counter stomach acid medicine that has calcium or magnesium. These products can break down the coating and enzymes in your pills. The amount you take depends on your body weight. You'll start with the lowest possible dosage and take more if you need it. You may also take drugs to lower stomach acid along with your PERT. Your doctor can prescribe these, and they're also available over the counter: Proton pump inhibitors like esomeprazole or omeprazole H2 blockers like cimetidine, famotidine, or ranitidine You may also need medicine to treat pain. If your doctor says it's okay, you may take over-the-counter pain medicines such as acetaminophen ( Tylenol ) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin ) on occasion. If those don't bring you relief, your doctor may prescribe stronger pain drugs, such as hydrocodone and oxycodone. Keep in mind that ibuprofen may lead to internal bleeding in the digestive tract and that drugs such as hydrocodone and oxycodone should be used with caution because of addiction potential. Emotional stress can also trigger pancreas inflammation. Tricyclic antidepressants like amitriptyline or nortriptyline may help ease pain. Gabapentin (Gralise, Neurontin), a drug that helps control seizures, can also help fight EPI pain. Pregabalin (Lyrica), which is used to treat seizures and nerve pain, also shows promise. How to Treat Conditions That Cause EPI You also can treat the health problem that causes your EPI, like cystic fibrosis, Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, or chronic pancreatitis. Cystic fibrosis. Treatments include enzyme replacement therapy, antibiotics, laxatives, and enemas. You can also eat a high-calorie, high-fat diet or take supplements to get the nutrition you need. If you have cystic fibrosis and EPI, you may also get diabetes. Keep your blood sugar levels under control, and take insulin or other medications if your doctor prescribes them. Shwachman-Diamond syndrome . Your doctor may prescribe PERTs, a high-fat and high-calorie diet, and vitamins and supplements. Scientists are also working to see if stem cell transplants will treat this genetic disease. Chronic pancreatitis . If you have alcoholic pancreatitis, it's important to stop drinking. You may need to enter a treatment program or work with a counselor to stop. If you smoke, stop. If there are stones blocking your ducts, the doctor can remove them. If you have a systemic illness like lupus or cystic fibrosis, treatment for the underlying condition may help the chronic pancreatitis. Is Surgery an Option? Surgery can open ducts that are clogged or blocked by gallstones, and decompression can widen a main pancreatic duct that's too narrow. Another option is to remove your pancreas and give you an autologous islet cell transplant. These are cells from your own body that make insulin. The doctor will get them into your body through a vein in your liver. This surgery can ease severe chronic pancreatitis pain or prevent or ease diabetes caused by chronic pancreatitis. But it's only used if other treatments haven't worked. If other treatments fail, the doctor might remove a portion of your pancreas, but this is usually a last resort. Taking Care of Yourself The right diet is very important for managing EPI. A dietitian can help you choose the foods that keep your energy level up and give you the nutrition you need. Here are a few tips: Eat six small meals per day. Try that instead of the traditional three. A big meal might not be appealing if you have digestion troubles from EPI. Don't drink or smoke. Alcohol can make it even harder for your body to absorb fat, and can damage your pancreas over time. Alcoholism is one possible cause of EPI. Smoking can lead to calcium buildup in your pancreas. Take vitamins . You may need to take vitamins A, D, E, and K to replace ones that aren't getting absorbed from your diet. EPI makes it hard for you to get the right nutrients because your body can't break down your foods. You also probably don't take in enough fats. Your doctor can prescribe vitamin supplements to help you get the right levels of these nutrients. They can also tell you which over-the-counter supplements and what dosage to take. What to Expect You can manage the symptoms of EPI by taking enzyme replacements and following an eating plan that gives you the right nutrition. Make sure you get the advice of a dietitian or nutritionist. One of your big challenges is to make sure you don't lose weight. A nutritionist can help you choose foods that have enough protein and nutrients. Also, talk with your family and friends to get the support you need while you're getting treatment. Ask your doctor about support groups, which let you talk to others who are going through the same things you are. Getting Support You can find more information about pancreas problems by visiting the web site of the National Pancreas Foundation . You can also learn more by visiting the web sites of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and the Shwachman-Diamond Syndrome Foundation ."
48,Rubella,"What Is Rubella? Rubella is a contagious infection caused by a virus that includes symptoms like a rash , fever , and eye redness. You may also hear rubella called “German measles” or the “3-day measles.” It mostly affects children but is usually mild. Rubella can, however, cause serious conditions or be fatal to your unborn baby if you become infected during pregnancy . The best way to protect yourself and your children from infection is to get vaccinated with the measles , mumps , and rubella (MMR) vaccine . Rubella vs. rubeola Rubeola is another name for measles. Both rubeola and rubella are caused by viruses and have similar symptoms, including skin rash, fever,  and upper respiratory infection. Rubella, however, comes with milder symptoms than rubeola and is less contagious. Rubella is a contagious infection that mostly affects children and causes symptoms like a rash, fever, and eye redness. It’s usually mild in kids but can be serious in people who are pregnant and in unborn babies. The best means of protection is to get vaccinated with the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. (Photo credit: Allan Harris/Medical Images) Rubella Symptoms Rubella is usually mild in children. Sometimes it doesn't cause any symptoms. A pink or red-spotted rash is often the first sign of infection in people with light skin tones. In people with darker skin tones, the rash may appear hyperpigmented or darker in the affected areas and rough or bumpy. The rubella rash starts on the face and spreads to the rest of the body. The rash lasts about 3 days. This is why rubella is sometimes called the ""3-day measles."" Along with the rash, you or your child might have: A mild fever -- from 99 F to 100 F Swollen and pink-colored eyes ( conjunctivitis ) Headache Swollen glands behind the ears and on the neck Stuffy, runny nose Cough Sore joints (more common in young women) General discomfort Swollen and enlarged lymph nodes Rubella Causes Rubella is caused by a virus. It used to be called ""German measles,"" though it’s not caused by the same virus that causes measles . Transmission of Rubella Rubella spreads when someone who is infected coughs or sneezes tiny germ-filled droplets into the air and onto surfaces. If you're pregnant, you can also pass rubella to your unborn child through the bloodstream. People who catch the virus are contagious for up to a week before and a week after the rash appears. Some people don't know they're infected because they don't have symptoms, but they can still pass the virus to others. If you’ve been diagnosed with rubella, tell the people who’ve been around you, especially anyone who is pregnant. Rubella Risk Factors Until the 1960s, rubella was a common childhood infection. Thanks to the MMR vaccine , the virus stopped spreading in the U.S. around 2004. Yet it still spreads in other parts of the world. People from certain areas where the virus is still active could carry the rubella virus when they travel. Anyone can catch rubella if they're exposed to the virus and haven't been vaccinated. Pregnant women face serious risks because rubella can cause serious complications to the baby during pregnancy, including death or serious birth defects like congenital deafness. Rubella Diagnosis If your doctor thinks you have rubella, you may get blood tests and a virus culture to confirm the infection. The virus culture comes from a throat or nasal swab or from a urine sample. The blood test will show different types of antibodies in your blood. Rubella antibodies There are two types of rubella-specific antibodies that appear in your body after infection, including: Rubella IgM. This antibody appears soon after you are infected with rubella or vaccinated against it. It can last in your body for up to 3 months. Rubella IgG. Rubella IgG occurs about 4 days after you develop the rash that comes with rubella and peaks within 1 to 2 weeks afterward. This antibody can last for a lifetime in your body. The best time to test for the antibodies is within 5 days of having a fever or a rash, when more than 90% of cases of rubella are positive for rubella IgM. Rubella vs. measles Your doctor may give you a blood test or take a virus culture to confirm rubella. The presence of rubella-specific antibodies will confirm whether you're infected or were recently infected or vaccinated. With measles, your doctor would use a blood test and a throat or nose swab to confirm a diagnosis. Rubella Treatment It’s a virus, so antibiotics won’t work. Most of the time, the infection in children is so mild, it doesn't need to be treated. You can bring down your child's fever and ease aches with pain relievers like children's acetaminophen or ibuprofen . Don't give your child or teen aspirin because of the risk for a rare but serious condition called Reye's syndrome, which causes swelling in the brain and liver. If you’re pregnant and think you’ve caught rubella, call your doctor right away. You may be able to take antibodies called hyperimmune globulin to help your body fight the virus. As for home remedies for rubella, there aren’t any that make the virus go away faster. But rest and pain relievers can help with self-care in mild cases, if needed. Rubella and Pregnancy It's best to be protected against rubella before you get pregnant , as getting infected during your first trimester can cause serious conditions or even death in your unborn baby. In fact, the most common cause of congenital deafness is rubella infection during pregnancy. Some women who get rubella during pregnancy have a miscarriage . In other cases, the baby doesn't survive long after birth. If you are planning to become pregnant, check your vaccination records to confirm you have received the MMR vaccine (the second and last recommended vaccination dose is given between the ages of 4 and 6 years). You should wait at least 4 weeks after getting the vaccine to become pregnant. If you’re already pregnant, you shouldn’t get the vaccine. While you're pregnant, you'll go through a routine screening to check for rubella immunity during pregnancy. If you're not sure whether you've had the MMR, tell your doctor immediately. They can use a blood test to check your immunity. Congenial rubella syndrome (CRS) Congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) is a condition that happens when a child becomes infected with the rubella virus via their mother during pregnancy. If you're infected with rubella during early pregnancy, you could have a miscarriage or your baby could be stillborn, born with birth defects, or hearing impairment. The risk of your baby being infected with the rubella virus and being born with serious associated conditions is greatest during your first trimester of pregnancy (through week 12) and decreases afterward (rare after the 20th week). If your child has CRS, they often have more than one serious condition, the most common of which include developmental delay, cataracts, congenital heart disease, and hearing impairment. It's possible for children with CRS to have only one condition; if this is the case, they usually have hearing impairment. Rubella Complications The most serious complications could happen during pregnancy, when the virus can pass from you to your baby in the womb. The risk is highest during the first 3 months of pregnancy. Babies who are infected can have serious conditions at birth like CRS. This is very rare in the U.S., but a baby can get it if they travel to another country where the virus spreads. CRS health problems in a baby can include: Heart defects Cataracts Deafness Delayed learning Liver and spleen damage Diabetes Thyroid problems Rubella can also cause complications in women who aren't pregnant, and in men. Young girls and women who get it can develop sore joints ( arthritis ). This side effect usually goes away within 2 weeks, but a small number of women will have it long term. It rarely happens in men and children. In rare cases, rubella can cause more serious health problems, like brain infections or swelling and bleeding problems. Rubella Prevention The best way to prevent rubella is to get vaccinated. Children need two doses of the MMR vaccine. They should get the first when they’re between 12 and 15 months old. They should get the second between 4 and 6 years old. Babies who’ll be traveling to a country where rubella is common can get vaccinated as early as 6 months old. If you're of childbearing age and you haven't been vaccinated, get the MMR vaccine at least 1 month before you get pregnant . This is most important if you plan to travel to countries where rubella spreads. Rubella vaccination Vaccination against rubella is normally provided as a combination vaccine, called the MMR (measles-mumps-rubella) vaccine. It could also include the vaccine against chickenpox (varicella), which is called the MMRV vaccine. It's recommended that children get the vaccine between 12 and 15 months of age and again between ages 4 and 6 years. When you get the vaccine, you're protected against rubella for life. If you've received the vaccine and have a baby, your baby is protected against rubella for 6 to 8 months. Getting the vaccine can prevent rubella during future pregnancies. Takeaways Rubella is a contagious disease that mostly affects children and causes symptoms like a rash , fever , and eye redness. It’s usually mild in kids but can be serious during pregnancy and in unborn babies. The best way to protect yourself and your children from infection is to get vaccinated with the measles , mumps , and rubella (MMR) vaccine to avoid long-term complications. Rubella FAQs What are the long term effects of rubella? Some women or people assigned female at birth may have arthritis. What happens if a pregnant woman is exposed to rubella? If you're pregnant and are not vaccinated, your unborn baby is at risk for health concerns like growth delays, deafness, and developmental issues. Some people who get rubella during pregnancy have a miscarriage . In other cases, the baby doesn't survive long after birth. When are you contagious with rubella? If you have rubella, you're contagious for about 1 week before the rash begins to 1 week after the rash disappears. How is the rubella virus transmitted? The rubella virus can be passed when an infected person coughs or sneezes or when contact is made with mucus from their nose or throat. People who are pregnant can pass it on to their child through their blood."
49,What Are Germ Cell Tumors?,"If you just found out that you or your child has a germ cell tumor, you may have a lot of questions about what it means and what comes next. There are many kinds of germ cell tumors, and only some of them are cancer . Germ cells don’t have anything to do with germs. They get their name from the word “germinate,” which means to begin to grow. That’s because as a baby develops before birth, germ cells move into place and become either eggs in the ovaries or sperm in the testicles. Sometimes, a group of germ cells grows in a way that’s not normal. A tumor forms. This usually happens in an ovary or testicle. You can also get a germ cell tumor in your brain , chest, belly, pelvis, or lower back, but it’s not as common. What Causes Them? Changes in the genes of a germ cell can cause it to grow out of control, which leads to a tumor. Doctors aren’t sure what triggers that change. Still, you may be more likely to get a germ cell tumor if you have: An undescended testicle (one or both testicles haven’t dropped into the scrotum) Birth defects in your central nervous system , genitals, lower spine, or urinary tract Genetic conditions like Klinefelter syndrome or Turner syndrome , where you have an extra or missing sex chromosome Other family members who had germ cell tumors What Are the Risk Factors? Anyone can get an ovarian germ cell tumor. But those who are 30 or younger are more likely to develop it. Things that raise your risk of developing testicular germ cell tumors include: Being white Poor sperm quality Testicular cancer Testicular microlithiasis. It’s a condition in which small lumps of calcium form in the testicles. HIV Orchitis. It’s a condition that causes one or both of your testicles to become inflamed. A weakened immune system caused by an organ transplant What Types of Germ Cell Tumors Are There? There are several, but five are more common than others: Teratomas, also called “dermoid cysts,” are not usually cancer , but they can be. They’re the most common germ cell tumors found in the ovaries. Usually, they’re treated with surgery. Germinomas are typically cancer , though they tend to grow slowly and can usually be cured. They are most often found in the brain and spinal cord, although they can also grow in the ovaries or testicles as well. Yolk sac tumors , (also called endodermal sinus tumors) are usually cancer. They form in the testicles and ovaries. It’s often an aggressive cancer that spreads quickly to the lymph nodes and other parts of the body. They’re typically treated with surgery and chemotherapy . Embryonal carcinoma has cancer cells that usually mix with another type of germ cell tumor. For example, embryonal carcinoma cells could mix with a teratoma and make it cancer. Choriocarcinoma is a rare cancer that happens in the placenta. It can affect both the mother and baby. Extragonadal germ cells are tumor cells that form in body parts outside of the ovaries or testicles. These are rare. Types of extragonadal germ cell tumors include: Mediastinal germ cell tumors. These form in the area between the chest and the spine, where the heart is located. Pineal region tumors form in the middle of the brain behind the brain stem. Retroperitoneal germ cell tumors form in the back of your belly. Sacrococcygeal germ cell tumors form in the lower part of your spine. What Are the Symptoms? It depends on the type of tumor and where it’s located. Common signs of germ cell tumors include: A mass on your ovaries or testicles Belly pain and swelling (caused by tumor) Bathroom troubles (a hard time pooping or holding in your pee, if the tumor is near your pelvis) Breast growth, pubic hair , or vaginal bleeding at an earlier age than normal Belly or chest pain Lump or a mass in the belly or testicles Testicles that aren’t the right shape or size Weakness in your legs (if the tumor is in the lower back) Wheezing or shortness of breath (if the tumor is near the lungs ) How Will My Doctor Test for One? They’ll start by asking questions about your health and symptoms, and then do a physical exam . After that, you may get: A biopsy . Your doctor takes a sample of the tumor to test it for cancer and help guide your treatment. Blood tests . You may get different tests to check the overall health of your blood , kidneys , and liver . Your doctor may also test for signs of a tumor, like high hormone levels. And if they think you have a genetic condition, you may also get a genetic test . Imaging . CT, MRI , X-ray, ultrasound , and bone scans can show where the tumor is and whether it has spread. How Are They Treated? It depends on the kind of tumor you have, where it is, and if it has spread. Germ cell tumors can spread to other parts of your body such as lymph nodes, the lungs, liver, or brain . Your doctor will also take your age and overall health into account. You may need more than one type of treatment. Your doctor will help you figure out the best approach. Treatment options usually include: Surgery to remove the tumor. If it’s cancer, your doctor needs to remove all of the cancer cells. That could mean removing the testicle or ovary and fallopian tube where the tumor is located. Chemotherapy ( chemo ) , uses drugs to kill cancer. It’s often used if the tumor is cancer and has spread to other parts of your body. Radiation uses high energy from X-rays or other sources to kill cancer cells. Newer kinds of radiation focus as closely as possible on the tumor to help limit side effects. What's the Outlook? The 5-year survival rate looks at your or your child’s likelihood of surviving 5 years after the cancer was first found. For children under 15 with germ cell tumors, the outlook is good, and the 5-year survival rate is high at 90%. For those between the ages of 15-19, the 5-year survival rate is 93%. After you or your child complete treatments, it’s possible for the tumor to come back. This is called a relapse. Talk to your doctor about what to watch out for, and make sure to go to your follow-up appointments."
50,What Is Duane Syndrome?,"Duane syndrome (DS) is a rare eye disorder some people are born with. The muscles and nerves around your eye don't work well together, and that keeps it from moving as it should. The disorder is also known as Duane's syndrome, Duane retraction syndrome, or Stilling-Turk syndrome. It happens when the nerves that control the eye muscles don't grow normally during pregnancy or are missing. As a result, some muscles stretch when they should tighten or stay loose when they need to squeeze. DS doesn't cause blindness and doesn't usually lead to other health issues. In very rare cases, it has been linked to problems with bones, eyes, ears , kidneys , and the nervous system. Most of the time, only one eye is affected -- usually the left one. But 20% of people have trouble with both eyes. Women are slightly more likely to have DS than men. Types There are three types of DS: Type 1: People with this form aren't able to move their affected eye out toward their ear. This is the most common kind of DS. Type 2: The affected eye can't move inward toward the nose. Type 3: The eye can't move outward or inward. Symptoms Signs of DS can include: Eyes that look different ways: This is called strabismus. It might happen all the time or just sometimes. Eyelid narrowing: One eye may look smaller than the other. Reduced vision in the affected eye: One out of every 10 people who have DS have ""lazy"" eye, a condition called amblyopia . Upshoot or downshoot: The affected eye sometimes looks up or down. Head position: People who have DS may tilt or turn their heads to try to keep their eyes straight. Some people with DS also have double vision and headaches. You might also have neck pain as a result of tilting our head. Cause DS can be passed down in families, but this is rare. Ninety percent of the people who have it are the only ones in their family with it. Experts believe something happens to cause DS between the third and eighth week of pregnancy. This is when a baby's eye nerves and muscles start to develop. There's probably more than one factor involved, like problems with certain genes or the mother being exposed to something in the environment. But it isn't clear what actually causes DS. Diagnosis Because DS has clear symptoms, most people are diagnosed before age 10. The exam usually includes a close look at your eye along with a vision test and measurements of how far your eye can move. The doctor also may want to do a hearing test and examine your spine , the roof of your mouth, and your hands. A gene called CHN1 is linked to some cases of DS. A genetic test can look for changes, or mutations, in the gene that might be passed on to other family members. This is done with a blood test. Treatment There's no cure for DS. But your doctor can do things to help your eyes line up when you're looking straight ahead and to protect your vision. Prescription glasses or contact lenses can also help. Your doctor might recommend that you wear a patch over the eye you see best with to help avoid lazy eye , or amblyopia. This forces your weaker eye to get stronger. Your doctor may also prescribe special lenses for glasses that shift your vision so you can hold your head in a more natural way. It's important to have regular eye exams -- young children may need to see their doctor every 3 to 6 months so a lazy eye can be treated right away. In severe cases, your doctor may recommend surgery to help other muscles in your eye make up for the ones that are affected. This won't give you normal eye motion, but it usually reduces the head turning."
51,Blepharitis,"What Is Blepharitis? Blepharitis is inflammation of the oil glands in your eyelids. It’s the most common cause of dry eyes . Blepharitis Symptoms The condition makes your eyelids red, itchy, and a little swollen. The bases of your eyelashes may look scaly. You might also notice: Feeling like something is in your eye A burning feeling in your eye Sensitivity to light Blurry vision Dry eyes Red eyes Watery eyes Crusty eyelashes when you wake up in the morning Blepharitis Causes Things that cause blepharitis include: Excess bacteria A blocked oil gland on your eyelid Hormone problems Allergies Infection with a virus Skin conditions such as seborrheic dermatitis , rosacea , and eczema Tiny insects called mites Blepharitis Diagnosis Your doctor will ask about your symptoms. They might also: Look closely at your eyelids, your eyelashes , and the texture of your skin Use a magnifying device to look at the edges of your eyelids and the openings of the glands there Check that your eyes are making enough tears Take a sample of material from your eyelids to check for bacteria Blepharitis Treatment There’s no cure for blepharitis. But you might be able to manage and treat it by taking care of your eyelids. Warm compresses can help soften crust and loosen oily debris. Follow these steps: Wet a clean washcloth in warm (not hot) water . Wring it out and place it over your closed eyelids for 5 minutes. Wet it again as necessary to keep it warm. Keeping your eyelids clean may also ease symptoms: Make a solution that’s half baby shampoo and half water . Put a clean cloth over your index finger and dip it into the mix. Close one eye . Gently rub the washcloth over your eyelashes and the edge of your lids for about 30 seconds to loosen clogged oil. Apply light pressure along your eyelashes to squeeze out clogged oils from the glands behind your lashes. Rinse thoroughly with a clean, warm, wet washcloth. Pat dry. Then do the other eye. Depending on the cause of your blepharitis, your doctor might recommend: Artificial tears Antibiotics , either as an ointment, drops, or a spray for your eyes, or as pills that you swallow Antiviral drugs Plugs that block your tear ducts in order to keep more tears in your eyes Other medications, such as glucocorticoids or cyclosporine Researchers are still studying other treatments involving pulsed light or heat. Blepharitis Complications The inflammation of blepharitis can lead to complications such as: Loss of eyelashes Excess tears Dry eyes, possibly raising your chances of a cornea infection Clogged glands that might get infected ( stye ) or form a lump ( chalazion ) Scarring on your eyelids Cornea inflammation Blepharitis Prevention A few lifestyle changes might help keep blepharitis away. Keep your eyelids clean. Remove all eye makeup before bed. Don’t use eyeliner on the back edges of your eyelids, behind the lashes. If you’re in the early stages of treating blepharitis, prevent further irritation by not using makeup . Once you start to use it again, replace products that you use in or near your eyelids. They may be contaminated."
