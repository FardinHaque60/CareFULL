0,Lab Test Results: What to Expect,"['If you’re waiting for lab test results to come back or you’re trying to figure out what they mean, the process and all those medical terms and numbers can be confusing. There are thousands of lab tests, and their results can mean different things. But a few general guidelines can help shed some light. How do doctors use lab tests? Nobody likes to get poked with a needle or pee in a cup. But lab tests are important tools, and doctors use them in a few different ways: To check on how you’re doing generally, like cholesterol or blood sugar tests when you have a physical To answer a specific question, like “Do you have strep throat ?” To track an ongoing condition or see how treatment is working How long does it take to get results? That depends on the test. Some can be done right in the office or a nearby lab, so you may have the results that day or the next. Other tests may take days or weeks, especially if they have to be sent to a specific kind of lab.', 'Before you leave your doctor’s office, ask when you’ll know the results. And ask the office staff to let you know when they’re in. (Some offices might not call if you don’t request it, especially if the results are in the normal range. Some offices also have options to allow access to your lab results on patient portals) What do my results mean? Here are a few things to look for: Positive vs. Negative. Some lab tests answer yes-or-no questions like whether you’re pregnant or have certain kinds of infections. These results are usually written as “positive” or “negative.” In this case, positive doesn’t necessarily mean “good” and negative doesn’t necessarily mean “bad.” Instead: Positive: The lab found whatever your doctor was testing for. So if you had a test for strep throat, testing positive means you do have strep throat. Negative: The lab didn’t find whatever you were tested for. A negative result for strep throat means that the lab didn’t find any strep bacteria in the sample, so you probably don’t have it.', 'Sometimes, the result might be “inconclusive.” That means the lab doesn’t have a clear yes or no answer based on your sample. Your doctor may want you to do the test again or have another kind of test. Reference Ranges. A lot of lab test results don’t give clear answers. Instead, they’re shown as a number -- like your cholesterol levels . These numbers don’t mean anything on their own, so you have to see how yours compare to a healthy range called your “reference range” or “reference value.” You’ll see this range on the lab test results. Are lab test results always right? While they do have to meet very high standards, they can be wrong sometimes. For example, you might get a false positive (the results say you have the condition you were tested for, but you really don’t) or a false negative (the results say you don’t have a condition, but you really do).', 'Lots of things can affect certain lab test results, like: Fasting vs nonfasting Being well hydrated vs dehydrated Medications Intense physical activity Some foods (like avocados , walnuts, and licorice) Sunburn Colds or infections Having sex Some medications or drugs When you get your results, ask your doctor how accurate the test is. If your doctor thinks your results may not be right, they may recommend that you do the test again or take a different test. What if my lab results aren’t “normal”? It’s easy to be concerned if you see words like “abnormal” on your results. But that’s not all that unusual. For example, if your results are just outside the reference range, it may not necessarily be a problem. If you’re worried about any of your results or have any questions, call your doctor’s office. You can talk to a nurse or schedule an appointment with your doctor to talk about them. They can help you understand what your results mean for you.', 'Lab Test Tips Always keep a copy of your results. This can be useful in case you switch doctors, need to show them to a specialist, or just want to look at them again later.', 'Remind your doctor if you take medications or have a health condition that can affect your results. That should be in your record, but it’s still a good idea to mention it. Be honest if you didn’t follow the instructions. With some lab tests, you’re supposed to fast (not eat), or not do certain activities, eat certain foods, or take certain drugs. If you forget and mess up, don’t worry -- just tell your doctor before you do the test. It’s not a big deal to reschedule, and it’s a waste of time to get the test if the results won’t be right. Make sure your doctor always uses the same lab to do your tests if possible. It can be hard to compare results from different labs because they may approach the test differently. For example, one lab might have different ranges for “normal” and “abnormal” than another. Ask your doctor questions about your results like: Why did I need this test? What exactly does this test result mean? How accurate is this test? When will I need to do this test again? Based on my results, do I need treatment or other tests?']"
1,What Is Prader-Willi Syndrome?,"['Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare, complicated condition that affects many parts of your body. It stems from a problem with one of your chromosomes (a strand of DNA that carries your genes). It can cause physical issues, like extreme hunger and weak muscles, as well as learning and behavioral problems. Only about 1 in 10,000 to 30,000 people in the world have PWS.', ""Causes PWS usually happens because of genetic changes on a region of chromosome 15. There's no way to prevent it. But if you plan to have a baby, you and your partner can be screened for PWS risk. A head or brain injury can also cause the syndrome."", 'Signs and Symptoms A baby may show signs of PWS early on. They may have almond-shaped eyes , their head may get narrow at the temples, their\xa0mouth might turn down at the corners, and they might have a thin upper lip. He also may have these symptoms: Poor muscle tone or limbs that hang loosely when you hold them Inability to suck or nurse well, so they gain\xa0weight slowly Eyes that cross or wander Appearance of being tired all the time Weak or soft cry Poor response to you', ""In early childhood, kids with PWS start to show other signs. It affects a part of their brain called the hypothalamus -- this is what tells you you're full when you eat enough food. People with PWS don't get the feeling of being full, so the most common signs are nonstop hunger and weight gain. A child with PWS may always want more food, eat big portions , or try to hide or store food to eat later. Some kids even eat food that's still frozen or in the garbage. Your child may also: Be short for their age Have small hands or feet Have extra body fat and not enough muscle mass Have sex organs that may not develop Have mild to moderate learning problems Be slow to learn to talk, sit, stand, or walk Have temper tantrums Pick at their skin Have sleep problems Have mood and speech problems Have scoliosis -- a curved spine Have too little thyroid or growth hormones"", ""These signs of PWS are less common, but some people have them: Vision problems, like being nearsighted Lighter skin and hair color than the rest of the family High tolerance for pain Inability to keep body temperature under control during a fever or in a hot or cold place Thick saliva that can cause tooth decay or other problems Osteoporosis, or thin, weak bones that break easily Because their sex organs don't develop, women with PWS may never get a period. Or they may start their periods much later than others. Men who have PWS may not have facial hair. They may have small sex organs, and their voices may not change in puberty. People who have PWS usually aren't able to have children."", ""Diagnosis Your doctor can usually diagnose PWS with a blood test called a chromosomal analysis. This shows if there's a problem with the gene that can cause PWS."", ""Treatments There's no cure, but if you have a child with PWS, you can help them stay at a healthy weight, have a good quality of life, and prevent health problems down the road. Their treatment will depend on the symptoms. Babies : High-calorie formula may help an infant stay at a healthy weight if they can't eat well because of weak muscle tone. You also can use special nipples or a Gavage feeding tube, which puts breast milk or formula directly in your baby's stomach , to make sure they get\xa0enough food. Older kids and teens: Set clear limits on how and when your child eats to avoid too much weight gain. A low-calorie, balanced diet and lots of exercise can help them stay at a healthy weight. Some kids with PWS may need to take extra vitamin D or calcium ."", 'If your child tries to grab and hide food, you might lock cabinets, the pantry, or the refrigerator. For teens with PWS, hormones like testosterone, estrogen , or human growth hormone (HGH) may help with small stature, poor muscle tone, or extra body fat. Hormone replacement may build stronger bones and prevent osteoporosis later on.', ""Antidepressants , like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), may help ease behavior problems caused by PWS. Specialized therapy can help your child deal with sleep apnea, thyroid issues, and other symptoms common to this condition. Kids with PWS should get regular eye exams to check for vision problems. Your child's doctor should screen for scoliosis, hip dysplasia, or thyroid problems . The Prader-Willi Syndrome Association has online support groups and tips for parents.""]"
2,Signs of Labor,"[""What Are the Signs of Labor? Labor is another word for your body’s natural process of childbirth. It starts with your first steady contractions and goes through the delivery of both your baby and placenta. Some have very distinct signs of labor, while others don’t. No one knows what causes labor to start or when it will start, but several hormonal and physical changes help indicate the beginning of labor. Unlike Braxton Hicks contractions, true labor contractions won't stop if you change positions. (Photo credit: Tyler Olson/Dreamstime) Lightening during labor The process of your baby settling or lowering into your pelvis just before labor is called lightening. It’s also referred to as the baby “dropping.” Lightening can happen a few weeks or a few hours before labor. Because the uterus exerts more pressure on the bladder after lightening, you may feel the need to urinate more often. However, the extra room in your upper abdomen may make it easier to breathe and relieve heartburn. Passing of the mucus plug The mucus plug accumulates at the cervix during pregnancy. When the cervix begins to open wider, the mucus is discharged into the vagina. It may be clear, pink, or slightly bloody. This is also known as “show” or “bloody show.” Labor may begin soon after the mucus plug is discharged or 1 to 2 weeks later."", 'Labor contractions Contractions are the tightening of the muscles of the uterus. During contractions, the abdomen becomes hard. Between contractions, the uterus relaxes and the abdomen becomes soft. The way a contraction feels is different for each person, and it may feel different from one pregnancy to the next. Labor contractions usually cause discomfort or a dull ache in your back and lower abdomen, along with pressure in the pelvis. Contractions move in a wave-like motion from the top of the uterus to the bottom. Some women describe contractions as strong menstrual cramps. Unlike false labor contractions or Braxton Hicks contractions, true labor contractions don’t stop when you change your position or relax. Although they may be uncomfortable, you’ll be able to relax between contractions. Diarrhea You may notice your stools are loose or watery. While it may seem weird, this may be a sign that labor is 24-48 hours away.', 'Back pain', ""It's common to have back pain during pregnancy. It could be due to the extra strain on your back and belly muscles or just changes in posture. Heat or cold packs and massages often help. During labor , you may have lower back pain and cramps that don't get better or go away. It can also be part of your contractions. The pain usually starts in your back and then moves around to the front of your body. Weight loss While you’re pregnant, it may seem like you’re never going to stop gaining weight. But many pregnant people actually lose a few pounds in the days leading up to labor. Nesting instinct Some find themselves with an urge to get ready shortly before their baby’s arrival. That’s known as the nesting instinct. You may have a sudden burst of energy after weeks of feeling more and more tired. You may feel like shopping, cooking, or cleaning the house. Be careful not to overdo it. Childbirth will take a lot of energy."", 'Activity of the baby Your baby may move less as you get closer to the start of labor, but let your doctor know. It can sometimes be a sign of a problem, not an early sign of labor. Cramps and back pain It may be hard to recognize a contraction, especially with your first baby. Many pregnant people have what feels like menstrual cramps in the lower abdomen. They may stay the same or may come and go. You might also have pain in your lower back that either stays or comes and goes. Looser joints If you find yourself “waddling” as your pregnancy winds down, that’s just your body getting ready for the job ahead. A hormone called relaxin loosens up the ligaments around your pelvis to make it easier for the baby to pass through. Water breaking The rupture of the amniotic membrane (the fluid-filled sac that surrounds the baby during pregnancy) may happen before you get to the hospital. It may feel either like a sudden gush of fluid or a trickle of fluid that leaks steadily. The fluid is usually odorless and may look clear or straw-colored. If your “water breaks,” write down the time this happens, how much fluid is released, and what the fluid looks like. Share these details with your health care provider. They’ll advise you on what to do next. Not all pregnant people have their water break when they’re in labor. Many times, the doctor will rupture the amniotic membrane in the hospital.', ""Effacement During labor, your cervix gets shorter and thins out in order to stretch and open around your baby's head. The shortening and thinning of the cervix is called effacement. Your health care provider will be able to tell you if there are changes to the cervix during a pelvic exam. Effacement is measured in percentages from 0% to 100%. If there are no changes to the cervix, it is described as 0% effaced. When the cervix is half the normal thickness, it is 50% effaced. When the cervix is completely thinned out, it is 100% effaced. Dilation The stretching and opening of your cervix is called dilation and is measured in centimeters, with complete dilation being at 10 centimeters. Effacement and dilation are a direct result of effective uterine contractions . The progress in labor is measured by how much the cervix has opened and thinned to allow your baby to pass through the vagina."", ""Emotional Signs of Labor In addition to physical signs, you may experience emotional symptoms that could be signals you're going into labor, including: Mood swings Anxiety Irritability Impatience"", ""Difference Between True Labor and False Labor Before “true” labor begins, you may have “false” labor pains, also known as Braxton Hicks contractions. These irregular uterine contractions are perfectly normal and may start to occur in your second trimester, although more commonly in your third trimester of pregnancy. They are your body's way of getting ready for the “real thing.” What do Braxton Hicks contractions feel like? Braxton Hicks contractions can be described as a tightening in the abdomen that comes and goes. Unlike true labor contractions, these do not get closer together, do not increase with walking, do not increase in duration, and do not feel stronger over time. How do I know when I am in true labor? To figure out if the contractions you are feeling are the real thing, ask yourself the following questions. Contraction Characteristics False Labor True Labor How often do the contractions occur? Contractions are often irregular and do not get closer together. Contractions come at regular intervals and last about 30-70 seconds. As time progresses, they get closer together. Do they change with movement? Contractions may stop when you walk or rest. They may even stop if you change positions. Contractions continue despite movement or changing positions. How strong are they? Contractions are usually weak and do not get much stronger. Or they may be strong at first and then get weaker. Contractions steadily increase in strength. Where do you feel the pain? Contractions are usually only felt in the front of the abdomen or pelvic region. Contractions usually start in the lower back and move to the front of the abdomen."", 'Timing Contractions When you think you are in true labor, start timing your contractions. To do this, write down the time each contraction starts and stops or have someone do it for you. The time between contractions includes the length or duration of the contraction and the minutes in between the contractions (called the interval). Some people use a contractions timer app to keep track of their contractions. Mild contractions generally begin 15-20 minutes apart and last 60-90 seconds. The contractions become more regular until they are less than 5 minutes apart. Active labor (the time you should come into the hospital) is usually characterized by strong contractions that last 45-60 seconds and occur 3-4 minutes apart.', ""Try to Relax How to ease labor pain It’s best to go through the first stage of labor (called the latent phase) in the comfort of your home. Here are some tips that might help: Distract yourself. Take a walk, or watch a movie. Soak in a warm tub or take a warm shower . But, ask your health care provider if you can take a tub bath if your water has broken. Rest . Try to sleep or take a nap if it is in the evening. You need to store up your energy for active labor. Apply heat . Use a heat pack on your lower back or abdomen to ease symptoms. Try massage . Ask a friend or partner to massage your back or feet. Try aromatherapy . While there's no proven evidence that it aids pain relief, some people find the scents from warming essential oils soothing."", 'When to Go to the Hospital for Labor When you suspect you are in true labor, call your health care provider. Also, call: If you think your water has broken If you’re bleeding (more than spotting) If the baby seems to be moving less than normal When your contractions are very uncomfortable and have been coming every 5 minutes for an hour If you have any of the signs of labor but you haven’t reached your 37th week of pregnancy. You may be going into labor before your baby is ready and will need medical help right away. Your health care provider will give you specific guidelines about when you should get ready to come to the hospital.', ""Takeaways You may experience a wide range of physical and emotional symptoms during the early stages of labor. Early on, make yourself as comfortable as you can at home and continue timing your contractions. Once you begin having contractions lasting 45-60 seconds every 3-4 minutes, it's time to head to the hospital."", ""Signs of Labor FAQs How long is labor? On average, labor for your first pregnancy lasts 12-24 hours. For pregnancies after that, labor is often shorter and may last 8-10 hours. Do frequent Braxton Hicks contractions mean labor is approaching soon? No. Braxton Hicks contractions are infrequent, uterine contractions that may begin during your second or third trimester. Although uncomfortable, these contractions will likely stop if you change positions. Unlike labor contractions, you should be able to talk and walk through them. You'll feel Braxton Hicks contractions in the front of your abdomen, not in your lower back, where you'll feel true labor contractions. Can you go into labor without losing your mucus plug? Yes. Some people may go into labor without ever losing their mucus plug. Others may experience different symptoms of labor first before losing their mucus plug.""]"
3,Understanding Labor and Delivery Complications,"[""What Are Common Labor and Delivery Complications? A pregnancy that has gone smoothly can still have problems when it's time to deliver the baby. Your doctor and hospital are prepared to handle them. Here are some of the most common concerns: Preterm labor and premature delivery One of the greatest dangers babies face is being born too early, before their body is mature enough to survive outside the womb. The lungs , for example, may not be able to breathe air, or the baby's body may not generate enough heat to keep warm. A full-term pregnancy lasts about 40 weeks. Having labor contractions before 37 weeks of pregnancy is called preterm labor. Also, a baby born before 37 weeks is considered a premature baby who is at risk of complications of prematurity, such as immature lungs, respiratory distress, and digestive problems. Drugs and other treatments can be used to stop preterm labor . If these treatments fail, intensive care can keep many premature babies alive. The symptoms of preterm labor and birth include: Contractions before 37 weeks of pregnancy , with a tightening and hardening of the uterine muscle, 10 minutes apart or less (these may be painless) Cramps similar to menstrual cramps (not to be mistaken with Braxton Hicks contractions, which typically are not at regular intervals and do not open the cervix) Low backache A feeling of pelvic pressure Abdominal cramps, gas, or diarrhea ; in combination with contractions, may signal preterm labor Vaginal spotting or bleeding A change in quality or quantity of vaginal discharge , especially any gush or leak of fluid"", ""Call your doctor if you notice or feel any of those symptoms. Protracted labor Protracted labor refers to cervical dilation that is abnormally slow or to abnormally slow fetal descent. This means the labor does not progress as fast as it should. This could happen with a big baby, a baby in a breech position (buttocks down), or other abnormal presentation, or with a uterus that does not contract strongly enough. Often, there is no specific cause for protracted labor. Both the mother and the baby are at risk for several complications, including infections, if the amniotic sac has been ruptured for a long time and the birth doesn't follow."", 'If labor goes on too long, the doctor may give IV fluids to prevent you from getting dehydrated. If the uterus does not contract enough, they may give you oxytocin, a drug that promotes stronger contractions . And if the cervix stops dilating despite strong contractions of the uterus, a C-section may be necessary.', 'Abnormal presentation ""Presentation"" refers to the part of the baby that will appear first from the birth canal. In the weeks before your due date , the fetus usually drops lower in the uterus. Ideally, for labor, the baby is positioned head-down, facing the mother\'s back, with its chin tucked to its chest and the back of the head ready to enter the pelvis. That way, the smallest part of the baby\'s head leads the way through the cervix and into the birth canal. This normal presentation is called vertex (head down) occiput anterior. Because the head is the largest and least flexible part of the baby, it\'s best for the head to lead the way into the birth canal. That way, there\'s little risk that the baby\'s body will make it through the birth canal, but the head will get caught. Some babies present with their buttocks or feet pointed down toward the birth canal. This is called a breech presentation. Breech presentations are often seen during an ultrasound exam far before the due date, but most babies will turn to the normal head-down presentation as they get closer to the due date.', ""Types of breech presentation include: Frank breech. In a frank breech, the baby's buttocks lead the way into the pelvis; the hips are flexed, the knees extended. Complete breech. In a complete breech, both knees and hips are flexed, and the baby's buttocks or feet may enter the birth canal first. Incomplete breech. In an incomplete or footling breech, one or both feet lead the way. Transverse lie is another type of presentation problem. A few babies lie horizontally in the uterus, called a transverse lie, which usually means the baby's shoulder will lead the way into the birth canal rather than the head."", 'In cephalopelvic disproportion, the baby\'s head is too large to fit through the mother\'s pelvis, either because of the size or because of the baby\'s poor positioning. Sometimes the baby is not facing the mother\'s back, but instead is turned toward their abdomen (occiput or cephalic posterior). This increases the chance of a lengthy, painful, childbirth , often called ""back labor,"" or tearing of the birth canal.', 'In malpresentation, the baby is not ""presenting"" or positioned in the normal way. In malpresentation of the head, the baby\'s head is positioned wrong, with the forehead, top of the head, or face entering the birth canal, instead of the back of its head. Sometimes a placenta previa (when the placenta blocks the cervix) may cause an abnormal presentation. But many times the cause is not known. Abnormal presentations increase a woman\'s risk for uterine or birth canal injuries and abnormal labor. Breech babies are at an increased risk of injury and a prolapsed umbilical cord, which cuts off the baby\'s blood supply. A transverse lie is the most serious abnormal presentation, and it can lead to injury of the uterus, as well as injury to the fetus . Toward the end of your third trimester , your doctor will check the baby\'s presentation and position by feeling your belly or with an ultrasound . If the fetus remains in breech presentation several weeks before the due date , your doctor may attempt to ""turn"" the baby into the correct position in a procedure called an ""external version."" One way to try to turn the baby after 36 weeks is an external cephalic version, which involves a doctor manually rotating the baby by placing their hands on the mother\'s belly and turning the baby. These manipulations work about 50% to 60% of the time and are usually more successful on women who have given birth previously because their uteruses stretch more easily. The procedure typically takes place in the hospital, in case an emergency C-section becomes necessary. To make the procedure easier to perform, safer for the baby, and more tolerable for the mother-to-be, doctors sometimes give a uterine muscle relaxant and then use an ultrasound and electronic fetal monitor as guides.', 'If the first attempt is unsuccessful, turning the baby may be tried again with an epidural pain medication to help relax the uterine muscles. Since not all doctors have been trained to do versions, you may be referred to another obstetrician . There is a very small risk that the maneuver could cause the baby\'s umbilical cord to become entangled or the placenta to separate from the uterus. There\'s also a chance (about 4%) that the baby might flip back into a breech position before delivery, so some doctors induce labor immediately. The closer you are to your due date, the lower the risk of reverting back to a breech position. But the bigger the baby, the harder it is to turn. The procedure can be uncomfortable for the mother, but if successful, may avoid a C-section, which is more likely if the baby can\'t be moved into the proper position. Premature rupture of membranes (PROM) Normally, the membranes surrounding the baby in the uterus break and release amniotic fluid (known as the ""water breaking"") either right before or during labor. Premature rupture of membranes means that these membranes have ruptured too early in pregnancy, meaning prior to the onset of labor. This exposes the baby to a high risk of infection.', ""If the baby is mature enough to be born, your doctor will induce labor or do a C-section if necessary. If the baby isn't mature enough, you may be given antibiotics to prevent infection as well as other medications to try to prevent or slow preterm PROM. Umbilical cord prolapse The umbilical cord is your baby's lifeline. You pass oxygen and other nutrients from your body to your baby through the umbilical cord and placenta. Sometimes, before or during labor, the umbilical cord can slip through the cervix after your water breaks, preceding the baby into the birth canal. The cord may even protrude from the vagina -- a dangerous situation because the blood flow through the umbilical cord can become blocked or stopped. You may feel the cord in the birth canal if it prolapses, and may see the cord if it protrudes from your vagina ."", ""Umbilical cord prolapse happens more often when a baby is small, preterm, in breech presentation, or if its head hasn't entered the mother's pelvis yet. Cord prolapse can also occur if the amniotic sac breaks before the baby has moved into position in the pelvis. Umbilical cord prolapse is an emergency. If you aren't at the hospital when it happens, call an ambulance to take you there. Until help arrives, get on your hands and knees , with your chest on the floor and your buttocks raised. In this position, gravity will help keep the baby from pressing against the cord and cutting off their blood and oxygen supply. Once you get to the hospital, a C-section will be performed."", 'Umbilical cord compression Because the fetus moves and kicks inside the uterus, the umbilical cord can wrap and unwrap itself around the baby many times throughout pregnancy. While there are ""cord accidents"" in which the cord gets twisted around and blocks the blood supply to the baby, this is extremely rare and can\'t be prevented. Sometimes the umbilical cord gets stretched and compressed during labor, leading to a brief decrease in blood flow to the fetus. This can cause sudden, short drops in fetal heart rate, called variable decelerations, which are usually picked up by monitors during labor. Cord compression happens in about one in 10 deliveries. In most cases, these heart rate changes are of no major concern, and the birth proceeds normally. But a C-section may be necessary if the baby\'s heart rate worsens or the baby shows other signs of distress. Umbilical cord compression can occur if the cord becomes wrapped around the baby\'s neck or a limb or gets pressed between the baby\'s head and the mother\'s pelvic bone. You may be given oxygen to increase the oxygen available to your baby. Your doctor may hurry along the delivery by using forceps or vacuum assistance, or, in some cases, delivering the baby by C-section.', ""Amniotic fluid embolism This is one of the most serious complications of labor and delivery . Very rarely, a small amount of amniotic fluid -- the fluid that surrounds the fetus in the uterus -- enters the mother's bloodstream, usually during a particularly difficult labor or a C-section. The fluid travels to the woman's lungs and may cause the arteries in the lungs to constrict. For the mother, this constriction can result in a rapid heart rate, irregular heart rhythm, collapse, shock, or even cardiac arrest and death. Widespread blood clotting is a common complication, requiring emergency care."", 'Preeclampsia Preeclampsia is a complication of pregnancy involving high blood pressure that develops after 20 weeks of pregnancy or shortly after delivery. Preeclampsia may lead to premature detachment of the placenta from the uterus, maternal seizure, or stroke . Uterine bleeding (Postpartum hemorrhage) After a baby is delivered, excessive bleeding from the uterus, cervix, or vagina, called postpartum hemorrhage, can be a major concern. Excessive bleeding may result when the contractions of the uterus after delivery are impaired, and the blood vessels that opened when the placenta detached from the wall of the uterus continue to bleed. It can also result from other causes such as cervical or vaginal lacerations.', 'Post-term pregnancy and post-maturity In most pregnancies that go a little beyond 41 to 42 weeks, called late-term pregnancy, there are usually no problems. But problems may develop if the placenta can no longer provide enough nourishment to maintain a healthy environment for the baby. The risks can become significant in post-term pregnancies, those that go to 42 weeks or more.', 'How Do I Prevent Problems With Labor and Delivery? The most important thing you can do to try to have a healthy baby is getting early and adequate prenatal care. The best prenatal care begins even before you are pregnant, so you can be in the best of health before pregnancy. To help prevent complications, if you smoke, quit. Smoking can trigger preterm labor. Researchers have found a link between gum disease and preterm birth, so brush and floss your teeth daily. It may also be helpful to reduce your stress level by setting aside quiet time every day and asking for help when you need it.', ""Transvaginal ultrasound Your doctor will check you for risk factors for preterm labor and premature delivery, and discuss any precautions you should take. Measuring the length of the cervix using a transvaginal ultrasound probe can help predict a woman's risk of delivering prematurely. This procedure is usually done in a doctor's office between 20 and 28 weeks of pregnancy for women who may be at risk."", ""Fetal fibronectin testing Fetal fibronectin testing can also be used as a possible predictor of preterm labor for women who may be at risk. This test is done like a Pap smear, and test results are used to predict your risk of preterm labor. The fetal fibronectin test can't tell for sure if you're in preterm labor, but it can tell you if you're not. A woman at risk for premature delivery can be forewarned about what to do if preterm labor symptoms occur, and can undergo further screening tests.""]"
4,Nystagmus,"['You may feel like your eyes have a mind of their own. They move up and down, side to side, or in a circle. This is called nystagmus or ""dancing eyes ."" It\'s a condition where you can\'t control your eye movements.', ""What Causes Nystagmus? It may be a sign of another eye problem or medical condition. You may be born with it, or you might develop it later in life. Nystagmus is caused by many different things, including: Being passed down from your parents Other eye issues, like cataracts or strabismus Diseases like stroke , multiple sclerosis , or Meniere's disease Head injuries Albinism (lack of skin pigment) Inner ear problems Certain medications , like lithium or drugs for seizures Alcohol or drug use Sometimes, your doctor may not know what causes it."", ""What Are the Symptoms of Nystagmus? Your eyes move without your control. It might be fast, then slow, then fast again. The movement might be in one eye, but it's usually in both eyes. You may notice that you nod your head or keep it in strange positions. You do that because it helps you focus when you can't hold your gaze steady. Things look clearer when you tilt or turn your head."", ""Objects may seem a little blurry to children with nystagmus. But the world doesn't look shaky to them. It's different if you develop the condition as an adult. Then the world appears to move a little when you look around. Nystagmus may also affect your vision . You might have a hard time seeing in the dark, or you may be sensitive to bright light. You may have problems with balance and dizziness . These can be worse if you're tired or stressed."", ""Getting a Diagnosis If you think you or your child may have symptoms of nystagmus, see your eye doctor. They’ll look at the insides of your eyes and test your vision . They’ll also look for other eye problems . You might get other tests, including: Ear exam Neurological exam Brain MRI Brain CT scan Recording your eye movement Your doctor may ask you to spin around in the chair for about 30 seconds, stop, and then try to stare at an object. If you have nystagmus, your eyes will first move slowly in one direction. Then they'll move quickly the other way."", ""How Do You Treat Nystagmus? If you developed nystagmus as an adult, there may be simple things you can do to lessen its effects. Sometimes you may just have to stop a medicine or quit drinking alcohol or taking drugs. Wear the right contacts or glasses to improve vision. It won't cure nystagmus, but it can help with other eye problems that can make it worse. Eye muscle surgery may be an option. The goal is to help with the head tilt that often comes with nystagmus. Sometimes surgery improves vision, too. Some drugs may ease symptoms in adults but not children. These include the anti-seizure medicine gabapentin ( Neurontin ), the muscle relaxant baclofen ( Lioresal ), and onabotulinumtoxina ( Botox ). For people who are very nearsighted , LASIK or Visian ICL can help improve eyesight. The surgeon may advisw you to take relaxation medication before the procedure to lessen the nystagmus."", 'Tips for Living With Nystagmus There are things you can do at home to make it easier to deal with your ""dancing eyes."" Use large-print books and turn up the print size on your computer, tablet, and phone. More lighting may help with vision, too.', ""If your child has nystagmus, encourage them to use their eyes. Big and brightly colored toys are easiest to use. Choose toys that make noise and have unique textures. Let your child hold books close to their eyes with their head tilted. Let them wear a hat or tinted glasses -- even indoors -- to reduce glare. Talk to your child's teacher to make things easier at school. It would be hard for them to share books or papers. Let them choose where to sit so they can see the board and the teacher.""]"
5,What Is Labyrinthitis?,"['When your inner ear gets infected or inflamed, it can cause a type of balance disorder known as labyrinthitis. Sometimes you can get it when you have an upper respiratory infection, like the flu . Inner ear infections that lead to labyrinthitis are usually caused by a virus. Sometimes bacteria can cause it, too. The symptoms of viral and bacterial infections can be so similar that a doctor needs to confirm which type you have before they can treat it.', 'What Causes It? Your inner ear contains a system of loopy tubes and sacs called the labyrinth. It contains some fluid and hair cells. It also controls your balance and hearing. An infection can disrupt information that flows from this area to your brain .', 'What Are the Symptoms? Labyrinthitis can not only affect your hearing, it can also make you feel dizzy. You might experience something more severe, like vertigo . This is the sudden feeling that you or the inside of your head is spinning. Other symptoms might include: Blurry vision Feeling unbalanced, like you’re about to fall Feeling lightheaded, or like you’re floating Nausea and vomiting Ringing in your ears or hearing loss Symptoms often appear without warning. For instance, you might notice them when you wake up one morning. This can be scary. If you feel lightheaded, or have trouble with your balance or vision , call your doctor or go to the ER right away.', 'Viral Labyrinthitis This form of the infection is more common than bacterial. But doctors know less about it. Some viruses seem to be linked. These include measles , mumps , hepatitis , and the types of herpes that cause cold sores , chicken pox , or shingles . If you have viral labyrinthitis, it usually will affect only one ear. It might quickly run its course and seem to go away. But it can return without warning.', 'Bacterial Labyrinthitis This can happen in one of two ways: First, bacteria from a middle ear infection make toxins that get into the inner ear and cause inflammation and swelling. Or second, an infection in the bones surrounding the inner ear makes toxins that cause the same symptoms. A chronic, or ongoing, middle ear infection can cause it. A more severe and uncommon type of bacterial labyrinthitis occurs when germs invade the labyrinth from outside the ear. A condition like bacterial meningitis can be the cause of this type.', 'How Is It Diagnosed? There aren’t any specific tests that let your doctor know you have labyrinthitis. They’ll first rule out other conditions that mimic it. They may want to test for health issues like: Brain or heart disease Head injury Side effects of prescription drugs or substances like alcohol , tobacco , or caffeine Stroke', 'What’s the Treatment? If your doctor rules out bacteria as the cause, they might prescribe antiviral meds or those that control swelling. Steroids like cortisone can help, too. You might also need medication to treat your symptoms, such as nausea or vertigo. Special exercises can help you regain your balance. A physical therapy program that focuses on this can speed up your recovery.', 'Recovery It might take a while -- from a few weeks to months -- but most people recover completely from labyrinthitis. It’s possible to have another bout of vertigo later on. This can happen if you turn over in bed or even tilt your head a certain way. Physical therapy can help you get better.', 'Will It Come Back? It may, but it might be a milder case. Your doctor likely will look for another cause for your symptoms at this point.', 'What Can I Do About My Symptoms? Don’t move too quickly -- you might lose your balance. Remove tripping hazards like area rugs and electrical cords. Put non-slip mats in your bath and shower. If you start to feel dizzy, lie down right away. People with vertigo often feel better if they lie down in a quiet, darkened room with their eyes closed. Drink lots of fluids and eat well. Avoid caffeine , alcohol , salt, and tobacco. If you think your meds are making you feel dizzy, talk to your doctor. They may change your dose, have you stop using them, or try something else. Don’t drive if you have dizzy spells.']"
6,What Is Mastitis?,"[""On a good day, your breasts can feel tender. They're always out on the front lines, taking the brunt of every afternoon jog and pouncing toddler. They don't get infected often, but when they do, it can hurt like no bad bra or PMS pain ever has. The catchall name for an infection of the breast tissue is mastitis. If you're breastfeeding, it's called lactation or puerperal mastitis. If you're not, it's called periductal mastitis. Mastitis can make you feel like you have the flu, but it can be cured a lot quicker."", ""Causes Mastitis is a common condition in women who breastfeed. As many as 1 in 10 breastfeeding women in the U.S. get it. It's caused by a backup of milk in the milk ducts. This happens when your baby isn't sucking or attaching properly, or favors one breast over the other. Mastitis can also happen if you don't feed or pump regularly. It is more common in the first three months of lactation. Breastfeeding women aren't the only ones who get mastitis. If you're not breastfeeding, a cracked nipple or nipple piercing can cause the breast infection. Both allow bacteria to get into the milk ducts. This is especially common in women who smoke."", 'Symptoms Just like any other infection, the tissue around the infected area becomes inflamed to keep it from spreading to other parts of the body. With mastitis, the infected milk duct causes the breast to swell. Your breast may look red and feel tender or warm. Many women with mastitis feel like they have the flu , including achiness, chills, and a fever of 101 F or higher. You may also have discharge from your nipple or feel a hard lump in your breast.', ""Diagnosis The symptoms of mastitis can come on very suddenly. You may feel like you're getting the flu before you feel any discomfort in your breast. When you feel that pain or see the telltale redness, call your doctor as soon as possible. Your doctor can diagnose mastitis based on a physical exam. The fever and chills give it away, as does a red, wedge-shaped area on the breast that points toward the nipple. There are two things to rule out: a breast abscess, which happens when mastitis isn't treated quickly, and inflammatory breast cancer , which is rare and shares the symptoms of redness and swelling."", ""Treatment Whether or not you're breastfeeding, antibiotics should have you feeling better in a day or two. Take them as directed. If you are breastfeeding, continue drinking lots of water, wearing loose bras, and resting as much as you can.\xa0Your doctor may suggest ibuprofen, or something like it, to take care of the fever and pain. It's important to keep breastfeeding and move that milk in and out of the ducts. Continue expressing milk if it is too painful to feed from the breast."", 'Prevention Tight bras and clothing put pressure on your breasts. Keep things light and loose. To keep milk from backing up, make sure your baby attaches correctly, and get all the milk out of each breast during every feeding. Or, make sure you are pumping to express the milk on a routine schedule. A lactation consultant can help if you need support.']"
7,What Is Lactose Intolerance?,"['Millions of Americans can’t digest a certain sugar in milk and milk products called lactose. If you’re one of them, you have lactose intolerance . The condition isn’t harmful, but it can be uncomfortable and may be embarrassing. There’s no cure, but you can manage it by watching how much milk or milk products you drink or eat. Being lactose intolerant is not the same as being allergic to milk. A food allergy is an immune system response.', 'What Is Lactose? Lactose is the sugar that’s in milk. Our bodies use an enzyme called lactase to break down that sugar so we can absorb it into our bodies. But people with lactose intolerance don’t have enough lactase. It’s produced in the small intestine. Even with low levels of lactase, some people can digest milk products just fine. For people who are lactose intolerant, their low lactase levels give them symptoms after they eat dairy. What is lactose malabsorption?', ""When you have lactose malabsorption, your small intestine can't absorb the lactose you've taken in. It passes through your digestive system unabsorbed. When it gets to your large intestine, it may cause symptoms – that's intolerance. If you have lactose intolerance, then by definition, you're not absorbing lactose and have symptoms. But you can have lactose malabsorption without lactose intolerance. What percentage of people are lactose intolerant? Lactose intolerance is common. The risk of it is linked to your ethnicity. Lactose intolerance affects about 85% of Black adults in the U.S. and about 15% of White adults. It's also more likely to affect you if you have Hispanic, Asian, Native American, or Jewish ancestry."", 'What Happens in My Body if I’m Lactose Intolerant? When we drink milk or have a milk-based product, lactase in our small intestine breaks down the milk sugar. It then gets absorbed into the body through the small intestine . But people who are lactose intolerant don’t have it so easy. In them, the lactose doesn’t get broken down. Instead, it goes on to the colon , where it mixes with normal bacteria and ferments. It can cause things like gas, bloating , and diarrhea . The symptoms are no fun, but they’re not dangerous. Most people can manage their symptoms by changing their diet and limiting the amount of lactose they consume. Some people do better by cutting lactose out of their diet altogether.', 'Lactose Intolerance Causes The main cause of lactose intolerance is that you produce too little lactase, the enzyme in your small intestine that breaks down lactose. Your level of gut sensitivity also plays a role. It\'s not unusual to eat things your body can\'t fully digest. They pass through the small intestine into the colon, where they feed the bacteria living there. Those bacteria are different for each person. This is called your ""gut biome."" Every person\'s gut tolerance is different, because no two gut biomes are the same. That\'s why the level and the symptoms of lactose intolerance vary from person to person. Can you develop lactose intolerance? Most people become less tolerant of lactose as they get older, because our bodies produce less lactase as we age. Your gut biome changes, too. One study found that lactose malabsorption – which plays a key role in lactose intolerance – increases in people older than 65.', 'Lactose Intolerance Types Lactose intolerance breaks down into four types.', ""Primary lactose intolerance This is the most common type. It happens because your body gradually stops producing enough lactase for you to process dairy products. Secondary lactose intolerance This happens when an illness or injury causes your body to slow or stop making lactase. It could happen because of a condition like Crohn's disease, a bacterial infection of your intestines, or celiac disease. It might also start because you injured your small intestine or had surgery on it. Your lactose intolerance might improve – although slowly – once the other problem is dealt with. Congenital lactose intolerance It's rare, but you might be born not being able to produce enough lactase. This is caused by a gene you inherit from both parents. Developmental lactose intolerance Premature babies sometimes have lactose intolerance because their small intestines weren't fully developed at birth."", ""Lactose Intolerance Risk Factors Most adults around the world can’t digest milk – 40% of humans stop producing enough lactase to digest milk between the ages of 2 and 5. Risk factors for developing lactose intolerance include: Age. You produce less lactase as you grow older. Ethnicity. If your heritage is African, Asian, Hispanic, or Native American, your risk is higher. Premature birth. Babies born early can have digestive systems that aren't fully developed. Conditions that affect your small intestine. This includes things like Crohn's disease, celiac, and bacterial overgrowth. Cancer treatment. Radiation and chemotherapy can affect your gut."", 'Lactose Intolerance Symptoms Your symptoms might take hours to show up after you eat dairy products, because it takes time for the undigested lactose to move into your large intestine. They can include: Bloating Gas Nausea and vomiting Stomach cramps and pain Diarrhea Stomach noise – gurgling and rumbling', 'Lactose Intolerance Tests Your body may be able to handle some lactose without symptoms. Experiment to find out the types and amounts of products with lactose you can eat and drink. There are some steps you can take to test yourself: Go without milk or milk products for a couple of weeks. If your symptoms disappear, bring dairy products back into your diet a little at a time to take note of how you react. If your symptoms continue after cutting out the dairy – or if they return – see your doctor to find out what’s going on.', ""Your doctor can test for lactose intolerance: Breath test. This will show if you have high levels of hydrogen when you exhale. If you do, you might be lactose intolerant. That’s because hydrogen is given off when lactose is broken down in the colon. The hydrogen gets taken by the blood up to your lungs , and then you exhale it. Blood test. This can show how your body reacts after you drink something with a lot of lactose. Your doctor might do this test if the results of the breath test aren't clear. Stool acidity test. This is the test used for children and infants. The health care provider will take a sample of your child's poop after they've eaten something with lactose. By analyzing the lactic acid and other substances in the sample, they can tell whether your child is digesting lactose. Genetic test. Using a sample of your blood or spit, a lab checks to see if your genes could be behind your lactose intolerance. Surgical biopsy. This is done in a hospital under anesthesia. The surgeon makes a cut in your stomach and takes a sample of your small intestine tissue. A lab then checks the sample for signs of lactose intolerance."", 'Lactose Intolerance Treatment You may be able to eat or drink small amounts of dairy. Some people do better if they have it with a meal. And some dairy products, like hard cheese or yogurt, may be easier to digest.', 'Also, there are lots of lactose-free dairy products at the supermarket. Or you can take commonly found over-the-counter supplements (like Lactaid ) to break down the milk sugars if you still want the real thing. Talk to your doctor about a liquid lactase replacement. These are over-the-counter drops that you add to milk. Eating foods that contain probiotics might help with your lactose intolerance. Researchers are looking into whether lactic acid bacteria in probiotics might stop your body from turning undigested lactose into gas. \xa0Studies have shown that yogurt with lactic acid probiotics can help with lactose intolerance, but more research is needed.', 'If you give up milk completely, you can still get plenty of calcium , vitamin D , and other nutrients in a healthy diet. Instead of milk, you can substitute these foods: Almonds Dried beans Tofu Collards Kale Calcium -fortified orange juice and soy milk Fatty fish , like salmon , tuna, and mackerel Egg yolks Beef liver How to stop lactose intolerance pain The symptoms of lactose intolerance are uncomfortable; your best bet to manage that pain is to watch your diet and limit how much dairy you eat and drink.', 'What Foods Contain Lactose? Always read labels. Many foods have lactose, including snack foods, bakery products, candy, dry mixes, dried vegetables, and infant formulas. Many medicines also have lactose, which is used as a filler, especially in white tablets. Many birth control pills and medications used to treat gas and stomach acid contain lactose. Your doctor or pharmacist can let you know if any prescription medications you take contain lactose. Some high-lactose foods to watch out for: Milk and heavy cream Condensed and evaporated milk Ice cream Cottage cheese Ricotta cheese Sour cream Cheese spreads Lactose-free alternatives Look for foods you can substitute for those with lactose. They include: Soy milk. It’s high in protein , potassium , and antioxidants . Rice beverages Lactose-free milk. It’s high in calcium and protein and contains many other vitamins , such as A, B, and K, zinc, potassium, and magnesium . Almond milk Coconut milk If you have symptoms of lactose intolerance, see your doctor. And if you’re diagnosed with it, talk with them about how to be sure you’re eating right.', ""Takeaways Lactose intolerance is a common condition. When you have it, your body doesn't break down lactose, the sugar that's in milk and dairy products. That can lead to symptoms such as gas, bloating, nausea, and diarrhea. Steps you can take to manage lactose intolerance include learning what foods contain lactose, limiting the amount of dairy in your diet, and taking a supplement to help you digest lactose."", ""Lactose Intolerance FAQs Why am I suddenly lactose intolerant? The most common form of lactose intolerance happens as people age. As you get older, your body produces less lactase, the enzyme you need to break down the sugar in milk and dairy products. You also can develop lactose intolerance because you have a digestive condition like Crohn's disease, you've had surgery on your intestines, or you're having treatment for cancer. What happens if lactose intolerance goes untreated? The symptoms of lactose intolerance are unpleasant, but they're not dangerous. There's no need to keep experiencing them, though. You can adjust your diet and take other steps to deal with lactose intolerance. The main long-term concern is that if you eliminate dairy from your diet, you might not get enough calcium or vitamin D. But there are ways to get those nutrients without eating dairy.""]"
8,LAM Lung Disease (Lymphangioleiomyomatosis),"[""LAM lung disease ( lymphangioleiomyomatosis ) is a rare lung disease that tends to affect women of childbearing age. In LAM lung disease, muscle cells that line the lungs ' airways and blood vessels begin to multiply abnormally. These muscle cells spread into areas of the lung where they don't belong. The air sacs in the lung also swell and form small pockets called cysts . As the cysts develop throughout the lungs, LAM causes breathing problems similar to emphysema . The muscle cells can spread outside the lung, forming noncancerous tumors on organs in the abdomen and pelvis."", ""What Causes LAM Lung Disease? No one knows what causes pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis. Estrogen seems to be involved, because women rarely develop LAM before puberty or after menopause . Fewer than 10 men are known to have ever developed LAM lung disease. Smoking isn't known to cause LAM: more than half of people with LAM lung disease have never smoked. LAM is so rare that it's unknown how often it really occurs. For example, during a three-year study by researchers, fewer than 250 people with LAM were identified in the U.S. Fewer than 2,000 women are known to have LAM today. LAM is not cancer , but appears similar to other conditions in which benign tumors grow uncontrollably. LAM lung disease shares some features with a different condition called tuberous sclerosis ."", ""Symptoms of LAM Lung Disease Most people with LAM lung disease experience shortness of breath. Other symptoms include wheezing and cough , which may be bloody. Often, people with LAM develop a sudden pneumothorax (collapsed lung). This occurs when one of the cysts near the lung's edge ruptures, allowing inhaled air to compress the lung. A pneumothorax usually causes pain and shortness of breath. If muscle cells migrate to areas outside the lungs, LAM can cause other symptoms: Chylous ascites: The flow of lymph is blocked by errant muscle cells. Chyle (milky lymph fluid) builds up in the belly. Angiomyolipomas: Noncancerous tumors may grow in the liver or kidneys . These can cause pain , bleeding, or kidney failure . In a few people with LAM, discovery of these benign tumors outside the lungs is the first sign of LAM lung disease."", ""Diagnosis of LAM Lung Disease Most people with LAM see their doctor because of shortness of breath. Because LAM is so rare, it's often misdiagnosed at first as asthma or emphysema ."", ""Generally, LAM is finally discovered after a long workup for shortness of breath. Tests frequently performed include: Chest X-ray : In LAM, a chest X-ray may show fine lines in the lungs, where muscle cells have multiplied. In the early stages of LAM lung disease, the chest X-ray film may look normal. Pulmonary function tests measure lung capacity and the ability to get oxygen from the air into the blood . These tests are usually abnormal in people with LAM. Computed tomography ( CT scan ): Chest CT scans are almost always abnormal in LAM lung disease. Cysts are usually visible. High-resolution CT (HRCT) may show the changes of LAM even more clearly. It's possible to diagnose LAM lung disease based on a woman's history and findings on high-resolution CT scan . But doctors often recommend collecting a sample of lung tissue ( biopsy ) to confirm the diagnosis. Lung biopsies can be collected in different ways: Bronchoscopy : An endoscope (flexible tube with a camera on its end) is passed into the windpipe and lower airways. Tools passed through the endoscope can collect a lung biopsy . Thoracoscopy : An endoscope is passed through a small incision into the chest to collect lung tissue. Open lung biopsy : Traditional surgery in which a surgeon works through a larger incision in the chest and takes a sample of lung tissue. A physician (pathologist) then examines lung biopsy tissue, helping make the diagnosis of LAM lung disease with greater certainty."", ""Treatment of LAM Lung Disease The drug sirolimus ( Rapamune ) is the first drug approved to treat lymphangioleiomyomatosis. The drug has been found to help improve the lung capacity in patients, allowing them to breathe easier. In addition, inhaled bronchodilators ( albuterol , ipratropium ) can help open the airways, reducing shortness of breath in some people. Patients with LAM lung disease should avoid smoking cigarettes as well as second hand smoke. Because hormones like estrogen seem to be involved in LAM lung disease, treatments that manipulate hormone levels could help some people with LAM. A number of hormone-related treatments have been tested in women with LAM lung disease: Progesterone Tamoxifen ( Nolvadex, Soltamox ) Synthetic luteinizing hormone -releasing hormones ( Leuprolide , Lupron ) In clinical trials that tested these therapies, some women were helped, but others were not. People who experience pneumothorax generally must undergo procedures to reinflate the collapsed lung and prevent its recurrence. If pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis progresses and becomes disabling, lung transplantation may be an option. Though it's a drastic treatment, most people undergoing lung transplants for LAM lung disease gain improved lung function and quality of life after surgery."", 'What to Expect With LAM Lung Disease Pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis is progressive, and so far there is no cure. Most women with LAM experience a steady decline in lung function, with increased shortness of breath over time. However, women vary widely in their experience of living with LAM lung disease. Some rapidly progress while others progress slowly: in some studies, nearly 90% of women were alive 10 years after diagnosis with LAM. However, surviving as long as 20 years after diagnosis is rare. Researchers are working to identify how muscle cells go awry in LAM. Clinical trials of experimental drugs to treat LAM lung disease are also under way.']"
9,Understanding Myasthenia Gravis -- the Basics,"[""What Is Myasthenia Gravis? Myasthenia gravis is a chronic condition that causes muscles to tire and weaken easily. For example, if you have myasthenia gravis, you may notice that during a meal, your jaw muscles become tired and weak, interfering with your ability to chew food. After you have rested for a little while, the muscles may become strong again, allowing you to resume eating. This waxing-and-waning weakness of muscles, worsening with use and improving with rest, is a hallmark of this disease. There typically are periods when you may notice more symptoms (called an exacerbation), interspersed with periods when symptoms decrease or disappear (remission). Myasthenia gravis affecting multiple muscle groups throughout the body is called generalized myasthenia gravis. Other common muscle groups that are affected may make it difficult for you to chew, swallow, smile, shrug, lift your arm up, grip, rise to a stand, or walk up stairs. When the muscles needed for breathing are affected, a patient is said to be in myasthenic crisis. This is a life-threatening situation. Though anyone can get myasthenia gravis, those most likely to do so are women between ages 20 and 40 or men between ages 50 and 70. If a woman with myasthenia gravis gives birth, the baby may have some temporary, and potentially life-threatening, muscle weakness (neonatal myasthenia) because of antibodies that have transferred from the mother's bloodstream. Typically, during the baby's first weeks of life, the antibodies are cleared from the baby's circulation and the baby develops normal muscle tone and strength."", 'Myasthenia Gravis Symptoms The disease most commonly affects muscles that control eye and eyelid movement, so the first symptoms you notice may be eyelid drooping and/or blurred or doubled vision. The majority will go on to have weakness in other muscle groups in 1 or 2 years. General symptoms of myasthenia gravis include: Weakness in your eye muscles Drooping eyelids Double vision Blurred vision Change in your facial expression Trouble swallowing Shortness of breath Problems speaking Problems walking and lifting things Trouble holding up your head If the muscles you use to breathe get weak enough that you can’t control them, it’s called a myasthenic crisis. This is a medical emergency that may require a ventilator to help you breathe. Around 15% to 20% of people with myasthenia gravis have at least one myasthenic crisis. They can be caused by an infection, stress, surgery, or a reaction to medication.', 'Myasthenia Gravis Causes Under normal conditions, nerves direct your muscles to work by sending a message through an area called a receptor. The chemical that delivers the message is called acetylcholine. When acetylcholine binds to a nerve receptor, your muscle knows to contract. In myasthenia gravis, your body attacks its acetylcholine receptors.', ""Myasthenia gravis is considered to be an autoimmune disorder. In an autoimmune disease, some of the body's antibodies (special proteins in your body that are supposed to be programmed to fight foreign invaders such as bacteria, viruses, or fungi) mistake a part of your own body as foreign, resulting in its destruction. In the case of myasthenia gravis, antibodies block, attack or destroy the acetylcholine receptors needed for muscle contraction. No one knows exactly what causes the body to begin producing the antibodies that destroy acetylcholine receptors. In some cases, the process seems to be related to the thymus gland, which helps produce antibodies. About 15% of all myasthenia gravis patients are found to have a thymoma, a tumor of the thymus. Although most thymomas are benign (not cancerous), the thymus is usually removed (thymectomy) to prevent the potential spread of cancer. In fact, thymectomy seems to improve symptoms of myasthenia gravis in some patients, even if no tumor is present."", 'Myasthenia Gravis Diagnosis To see if you have myasthenia gravis, your doctor will start with a neurological exam. This includes a test of your: Reflexes Muscle strength Muscle tone Touch Sight Coordination Balance Fatigability (how soon your muscles weaken) Then you’ll have tests to help look more closely at symptoms of myasthenia gravis. These include: Edrophonium test. Your doctor injects you with a chemical called edrophonium chloride to see if it improves your muscle strength. If it does, that’s a sign you might have myasthenia gravis. Ice pack test. If you have a drooping eyelid, your doctor may put an ice pack on it for 2 minutes to see if the low temperature has an effect on it. Blood test. Your doctor will draw some of your blood and send it to a lab to check for certain antibodies that affect muscle nerve receptors. Repetitive nerve stimulation. This test uses electrodes on your muscles to send small electrical pulses to see if your nerves react to the signals. Single-fiber electromyography (EMG). Your doctor puts a thin wire electrode through your skin and into a muscle. It can test the electrical activity between your brain and your muscles. Imaging. Your doctor may suggest a CT scan or MRI to look more closely for a tumor on your thymus that could be causing symptoms. Pulmonary functioning tests. Your doctor tests your breathing to see if your lungs are affected by myasthenia gravis.', 'Myasthenia Gravis Treatment and Home Remedies Your treatment will depend on your age, how severe your symptoms are, and how fast the condition is progressing. You might need one or several treatments together. Your doctor may recommend a medication such as: Cholinesterase inhibitors. These medications boost the communication between your nerves and your muscles. They can help strengthen muscles. Corticosteroids. Corticosteroids such as prednisone mute your immune system and slow the release of antibodies that could be helping block your nerve receptors. Immunosuppressants. Your doctor may add immunosuppressants to your corticosteroids to help reduce your immune system response. Neonatal Fc receptor blocker. It works by blocking the\xa0autoantibodies that cause myasthenia gravis and helps ease the symptoms. If you’re dealing with a sudden worsening of symptoms or will soon have surgery or other therapies, your doctor may recommend intravenous (IV) therapy. Choices for this include: Plasmapheresis. This procedure is like dialysis, because it filters your blood. Your blood goes through a machine that removes certain antibodies. The effects are faster than other treatments but they\xa0are not long lasting (about a month). This procedure is usually used in a crisis. Intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIg ). This therapy injects new antibodies into your bloodstream. These antibodies alter your immune system response to help with symptoms. Results typically last about 3-6 weeks. Monoclonal antibodies. Your doctor will likely recommend this option only if other treatments haven’t worked. They can have serious side effects.', 'If your myasthenia gravis is due to a tumor on your thymus gland, you may need surgery to remove the whole gland (thymectomy). Even if you don’t have a tumor, taking your thymus out may help ease your symptoms. It may take years to see benefits from a thymectomy. You may need open surgery to remove your thymus . A surgeon opens your breastbone to get to your thymus and take it out. Another option that may work is minimally invasive surgery. There are two options: Video-assisted thymectomy. Surgeons make small cuts in your neck or chest and use a long, thin camera called an endoscope along with instruments to take out your thymus. Robot-assisted thymectomy. Surgeons make the same small cuts as video-assisted thymectomy and then use a robot with a camera and mechanical arms to remove your thymus.', 'In addition to medical treatments, you can make lifestyle changes to help manage your myasthenia gravis symptoms, including: Save energy when you eat. If chewing is a struggle, eat at times when you have the most strength. You might find it easier to eat several small meals a day instead of longer, larger ones less often. Stick to soft foods, and take breaks between bites. Install safety aids. Put handrails anywhere you might need a helpful handle, like next to the toilet or near tables. Remove any tripping risks such as rugs or floor clutter. Let machines do the work. Switch to an electric toothbrush and can opener, or any other device that can save you strength. Wear an eye patch. It can help with double vision. Use one when you watch TV or read, and switch eyes from time to time. Plan ahead. Be smart with your strength. Do chores or errands when you feel best during the day.']"
10,Ichthyosis,"[""What Is Ichthyosis? Ichthyosis is a skin disorder in which skin cells don't properly separate or shed. This leaves behind rough, dark, scaly skin. (Photo credit: Science Source) Ichthyosis is a group of about 30 skin conditions that cause skin dryness and scaling. The condition gets its name from the Greek word for fish because the skin looks like fish scales. You might also hear it called fish scale or fish skin disease. People with this condition lose the protective barrier that keeps moisture in their skin. They also make new skin cells too quickly or shed old cells too slowly. This leads to a buildup of thick, scaly skin. Most cases of ichthyosis are mild, but it can be more severe. Some types of ichthyosis can affect your other organs, too. Ichthyosis can't be cured, but treatments can relieve the scaling and make you feel more comfortable."", ""Types of Ichthyosis Some types only cause dry and scaly skin. Others cause problems inside the body, too. Ichthyosis has lots of types—more than 30. Most forms of the disease are very rare. They can go along with other conditions or syndromes. Some types include: Ichthyosis vulgaris . It's mild and affects about one out of every 250 people. Gray, brown, or white scales can show up usually in infancy. Most people with ichthyosis have this type. X-linked recessive ichthyosis. It affects about one out of 6,000 people, usually males. It starts at about 3-6 months and gets worse over time. You'll usually see scaling on the neck, face, trunk, and legs. Harlequin ichthyosis. You'll usually see this in newborns. It causes thick scaly plates all over the skin. It can change the way a newborn's face looks and can make it hard to move their joints. Epidermolytic ichthyosis. This type also happens in new babies. Infants with this type have fragile, blistered skin all over their bodies. Later, the blisters go away, and the skin gets scaly. Lamellar ichthyosis. Newborns with this have a clear membrane (collodion membrane) all over their bodies. After a few weeks, this covering peels away, leaving big, dark, plate-like scales. Congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma. This type is there at birth, too. Babies with this may also have a collodion membrane. Erythrokeratodermia variabilis. This type shows up in babies after a few months and can get worse or spread as they grow. Your skin may look rough, thick, or red, especially on the face, butt, arms, and legs. Progressive symmetric erythrokeratoderma. This type can start later in childhood compared with other types. You'll see dry, red, scaly skin, especially on the arms, legs, butt, face, ankles, and wrists."", ""Ichthyosis Causes Ichthyosis can be genetic (or inherited). It also can be acquired, meaning it happens later because of another illness or from medicine you're taking. Inherited ichthyosis is a genetic condition. That means it's passed down to you from your parents. Sometimes, parents who don't have ichthyosis can still pass it down. Genes are the codes that tell your body to make proteins, which determine how your body looks and functions. When there are changes or mutations in a gene, it can cause disease. Ichthyosis gene mutations affect the proteins that protect your skin and keep it moist. They also affect how quickly your body gets rid of or grows new skin cells. Ichthyosis usually shows up in infancy or early childhood. If both of your parents have a mutation that can cause it, you're likely to have a more serious condition than if only one of them has it. Sometimes, ichthyosis is genetic without being inherited. This can happen when a new mutation comes up in a developing fetus. In this case, the baby won't have enough of a protein (filaggrin) they need for their outer skin layer. They also won't shed dead skin cells the way they should."", ""Acquired ichthyosis shows up in adulthood. Doctors don't know why it happens, but people with it often have other conditions, including: Underactive thyroid gland Kidney disease Sarcoidosis , a rare disease that causes patches of inflammation inside the body Cancer such as Hodgkin's lymphoma HIV infection Some medicines might also trigger the condition, but it's rare. These include: Cancer drugs, such as hydroxyurea ( Droxia , Hydrea ) and vemurafenib ( Zelboraf ) Protease inhibitors, a group of drugs used to treat HIV infections Nicotinic acid , a vitamin that's used to treat high cholesterol Medicines for ulcers and acid reflux, such as cimetidine Clofazimine, which treats leprosy"", ""Ichthyosis Symptoms Your symptoms will depend on what type of ichthyosis it is. But 95% of people with it have ichthyosis vulgaris. It's possible to have ichthyosis and not even know it. You might just think you have dry skin. Dry, scaly skin is the main symptom. The scales form on only some parts of the body, such as the: Trunk Stomach Buttocks Legs Face and scalp"", ""The scales can be white, gray, or dark brown. They might have thick or thin cracks running through them. Dryness and scaling get worse in cold, dry weather. They usually improve in warmer weather. Other signs of ichthyosis vulgaris, the most common type, include: Itchy, dry skin Skin that's thick or rough and may look dirty, especially on the palms of your hands and soles of your feet White, gray, or brown scales Extra lines on the hands and feet that may be deep or even crack Rough and bumpy skin on the arms, thighs, and butt that may look like acne (keratosis pilaris) Trouble sweating Other, more severe signs of ichthyosis are: Skin redness Blisters that can break to cause wounds Peeling Itchiness Pain Lines on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet Tight skin that makes it hard to move Hair loss or hair that breaks easily Dry eyes that are hard to close Trouble hearing Trouble bending your joints Many people with ichthyosis also have eczema , a red, itchy rash . Ichthyosis usually shows up in babies or young kids before age 5. Symptoms may get worse until a child reaches puberty. Sometimes, it can get better with age. Your symptoms will depend on how severe your disease is and what's causing it. It usually doesn't go away, and you may need treatment to help with symptoms all your life."", ""Ichthyosis Complications Skin is your body's barrier. It holds moisture inside and keeps out bacteria and other invaders that might make you sick. When ichthyosis makes pieces of your skin scale off, you lose some of this protective layer. Scaling can lead to complications such as: Skin infections Dehydration Blocked sweat glands, which can lead to overheating Slow hair growth from scales on the scalp or hair loss Burning more calories because the skin has to work harder to turn over cells Ichthyosis can cause emotional issues, too. The scales can affect the way you look. People with this condition sometimes feel depressed and have low self-esteem. Kids with ichthyosis are more likely to get: Eczema Asthma Hay fever Hives Men with ichthyosis are also at an increased risk of: Testicular cancer Undescended or hidden testicles Low sperm count Other complications include: Vision loss from damage to the cornea (the clear layer in the front of the eye ) Hearing loss Brain and nervous system problems"", ""Ichthyosis Diagnosis Sometimes it's so mild that it looks like regular dry skin . If the dryness and scaling bother you, see a dermatologist—a doctor who treats skin problems —for treatment. They may: Ask if other people in your family have any skin problems. Look at your skin, hair, and nails. Take a sample of skin to check under a microscope. This is called a biopsy . Test your blood or saliva for gene changes that cause certain types of ichthyosis."", ""Ichthyosis Treatment It can't be cured, but treatments can help you manage dry and scaly skin. Rub cream, lotion, or ointment onto your skin every day to add moisture. Look for rich creams that have any of these ingredients: lanolin , alpha hydroxy acids, urea, or propylene glycol. Products with ceramides or cholesterol also keep skin moist. Apply the lotion right after you step out of the shower or bath, while your skin is still damp. This will help hold in moisture. Other things you can try: Take more than one bath a day to hydrate your skin. Take baths in salt water to help with burning, stinging, or itching. If you get infections often, try adding a little bit of bleach to your baths. Rub your skin with a pumice stone or rough sponge to help get rid of dead skin. Remove dead skin with a product that contains salicylic acid , glycolic acid, or lactic acid ."", ""If the dryness and scaling are severe, your doctor might prescribe an oral retinoid medicine such as acitretin ( Soriatane ) or isotretinoin ( Absorica , Claravis , Sotret , and others). Retinoids can cause side effects such as weakened bones, dry mouth , and upset stomach . You might need antibiotics for skin infections. If your skin condition is caused by another condition or medicine you're taking, treating the disease or changing the dose may help. Ichthyosis isn't life-threatening, but it can be life-changing. Your dermatologist can recommend treatments to help your skin look and feel better. If you feel depressed or have low self-esteem, talk to a therapist or other mental health experts."", ""Ichthyosis Prevention You can't make ichthyosis go away. But there's a lot you can do to make it feel better and help with your symptoms. Some steps you can take include: Taking baths or other steps to add moisture to your skin. Staying cool.

Avoid laundry detergents or other products with dyes and perfumes. It always helps to find other people with the same condition. They can be a source of support and have ideas for things to try. Look for a support group online or where you live with other people who have ichthyosis. If you're struggling with your skin condition, reach out to a mental health professional.""]"
11,What Is Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis?,"['You may know that white blood cells are your body’s infection fighters. But if your body makes too much of a type of immune cell called histiocytes, they can cause tumors, lesions, and other tissue damage. One of these rare disorders -- which resembles some types of cancer -- is called Langerhans cell histiocytosis, or LCH. It most commonly appears in toddlers and very young children, but you can have it as an adult, too.', 'Symptoms LCH can show up on many places on your body, but most often on your skin and bones. It can affect any organ, including your lungs , liver , brain , spleen , or lymph nodes . In about 8 out of 10 people, LCH leads to tumors called granulomas in the skull and in other bones. That can cause pain and swelling, and sometimes it can fracture your arms or legs. LCH symptoms can range from mild to more serious. Some people are born with it, and the disease eventually goes away on its own. But others have a severe and long-lasting type that affects multiple parts of the body.', 'Along with your bones, it can affect your: Skin. Red, scaly bumps in skin folds are common. Infants with LCH can get red, scaly scalps, which is often mistaken for cradle cap , a common skin condition. Liver . Usually, only severe cases of LCH affect the liver. Your skin might appear jaundiced, or yellow, and your blood can take longer to clot. Lymph nodes. These glands, which are behind the ears , in the neck, and in other places, can swell up. You also might have trouble breathing or have coughs .', 'Diagnosis Your doctor will know if you have LCH after a tissue biopsy . That’s when a specialist called a pathologist views the sample under a microscope for specific proteins and other markers of the disease. In addition to the physical exam , your doctors may order other tests based on your symptoms: X-rays of your lungs and bones Bone marrow biopsy to look for signs of LCH Blood chemistry test to check your kidneys , liver , thyroid , and immune system MRIs and PET and CT scans to get detailed images of your body Urinalysis to check levels of red and white cells, protein, and sugar in your pee', 'Causes We don’t know all the reasons why some people get LCH. About half of the people with the disorder have a faulty gene that makes the Langerhans immune cells grow out of control. That genetic mutation happens after birth, which means you usually won’t get LCH from your parents. Researchers suspect that other things may also play a role: Smoking Parents who were exposed to environmental toxins, like benzene or wood dust Infections as a newborn Family history of thyroid disease', 'Treatments As with some types of cancer , doctors sometimes treat LCH with chemotherapy . Many people with the disorder get care from cancer specialists like oncologists and hematologists. But unlike most cancers, limited forms of LCH sometimes spontaneously go away on their own. Beside chemotherapy, options for treatment include: Low-dose radiation to targeted part of the body Surgery to remove LCH lesions Steroids like prednisone or anti-inflammatory drugs Ultraviolet light therapy for skin conditions Stem cell transplant Bone marrow, liver, or lung transplants in very serious cases A great majority of people with LCH recover with treatment. If the disease is in your spleen, liver, or bone marrow, it’s called a high-risk LCH. About 80% of people with that type survive.']"

About 5% to 10% of health care workers have some form of latex allergy . Other people who are more likely than most people to get it include those who have: A defect in their bone marrow cells A deformed bladder or urinary tract Had more than one operation A urinary catheter, which has a rubber tip Allergy , asthma , or eczema Spina bifida Food allergies to apples , bananas, carrots , celery, chestnuts, kiwi, melons, papayas, raw potatoes, avocadoes, pineapple , and tomatoes Rubber industry workers and people who use condom s are also more likely than others to get a latex allergy.', 'How Can You Be Exposed to Latex? You can get exposed to latex: Through the skin , such as when you wear latex gloves Through mucous membranes, such as the eyes , mouth, vagina , and rectum Through inhalation. Rubber gloves can contain cornstarch powder, which absorbs the latex and can become airborne when the gloves are removed. Through the blood . This can happen when some medical devices containing rubber are used.', ""Types of Latex Allergies There are three types of latex reactions: 1. Irritant contact dermatitis . This is the least-threatening type, and it’s not an allergic skin reaction. It usually happens due to repeated exposure to chemicals in latex gloves and leads to dryness, itching , burning, scaling, and skin problems . This generally starts 12-24 hours after contact. 2. Allergic contact dermatitis. This is a delayed reaction to additives used in latex processing. It results in the same type of reactions as irritant contact dermatitis . But the reaction is more severe, spreads to more parts of the body, and lasts longer. Symptoms can start anywhere from 1 to 4 days after you've come in contact with latex."", '3. Immediate allergic reaction (latex hypersensitivity). This one is the most serious. It can show up as a nasal allergy with hay fever-like symptoms, conjunctivitis ( pinkeye ), cramps , hives , and severe itching. It’s rare, but symptoms may also include rapid heartbeat, tremors, chest pain , trouble breathing , low blood pressure , or anaphylaxis , a severe allergic reaction that can be life-threatening. If you have severe symptoms, call your doctor or 911 immediately, or go to the nearest emergency room.', 'Latex Allergy Diagnosis Doctors diagnose a latex allergy in people who: Have had symptoms of an allergic reaction -- like a skin rash , hives , eye tearing or irritation, wheezing , itching , or trouble breathing -- when exposed to latex or a natural rubber product Are known to be at risk for a latex allergy and blood or skin tests show that they have it, even if they haven’t had symptoms. If you need a skin test to check on a latex allergy, an allergy specialist must supervise it, in case you have a severe reaction.', 'Latex Allergy Treatment There’s no cure for a latex allergy. If you’re allergic to latex, the best course of action is to avoid contact with it. If you do have a reaction, the treatment will depend on how serious it is. For irritated skin, these may be enough: Antihistamines Corticosteroid medicines Soothing lotion like calamine or a 1% hydrocortisone cream If your reaction is severe, you may need these right away: Epinephrine IV fluids Watchful care from medical professionals If you have a latex allergy , wear a medical alert bracelet or another type of ID in case of an emergency. You may also need to carry two epinephrine shots if your doctor recommends that.', 'Latex Allergy Home Triggers An allergy to latex can become worse the more you come in contact with it. If you know you have this condition, be aware of products that may have the potential to cause a reaction. Ask your doctor if you need to avoid them. Many items have latex in them.

You may need to ask product makers to be sure.', 'Home goods that are made with latex include: Rubber sink stoppers and sink mats Gloves for dishwashing and household cleaning Rubber or rubber-grip utensils Rubber electrical cords or water hoses Bath mats and floor rugs that have rubber backing Toothbrushes with rubber grips or handles Rubber tub toys Sanitary napkins (that contain rubber) Condoms and diaphragms Diapers that contain rubber Adult undergarments that contain rubber Waterproof bed pads containing rubber Undergarments, socks, and other clothing with elastic bands that contain rubber Adhesives such as glue, paste, art supplies, glue pens Older Barbie dolls and other dolls that are made of rubber Rubber bands, mouse and keyboard cords, desktop and chair pads, rubber stamps Mouse and wrist pads containing rubber Keyboards and calculators with rubber keys or switches Pens with comfort grip or any rubber coating Remote controllers for TVs or recording devices with rubber grips or keys Camera, telescope, or binocular eyepieces Bathing caps and elastic in bathing suits Some rain boots and raincoats', 'Outside the home, latex is also in many items, such as: Grocery store checkout belts Restaurants where workers use latex gloves to prepare food Some balloons Car races that give off tire and rubber particles ATM machine buttons made of rubber Gloves worn by beauty salon workers Medical products containing latex include: Tourniquets Blood pressure pads EKG pads Stethoscopes IV tubing Some adhesive bandages Dental devices', ""How Can I Safely Visit a Doctor or Dentist? Tell them about your latex allergy at least 24 hours before your appointment. The hospital or doctor's office should have a plan in place so they can use products like nonlatex gloves to treat you. Ask for the first appointment in the morning. Even if your doctor or dentist uses latex-free gloves for you, there can be latex particles in the air from gloves used with other patients. You're more likely to avoid these particles by getting there early. If you have to stay in the hospital, you'll usually be given your own room, free of products that might give you a reaction."", 'Food Triggers Between 30% and 50% of people who have a latex allergy also have reactions to eating, touching, or even smelling certain foods. This happens because some fruits and vegetables have proteins that are structured a lot like the ones that cause the reaction to latex. It’s called a cross-reaction. These foods include: Avocado Banana Celery Cherry Chestnut Fig Grape Hazelnut Kiwi Melon Nectarine Papaya Peach Pineapple Plum Potato Rye Strawberries Tomato Wheat Almonds, peppermint, and mustard can also cause cross-reactions. If you’re allergic to any of these foods, you may also have a latex allergy, even if you don’t know it. Let your doctor and dentist know so they can keep from exposing you.']"
13,Constipation Treatment,"['Lately you\'ve been feeling a little -- to put it delicately -- backed up. You\'re not ""going"" as often as you should, and you feel bloated and uncomfortable. A lot of Americans -- more than 4 million by some estimates -- deal with constipation on a regular basis. Women have constipation more often than men. This may have to do with the slower movement of food through a woman\'s intestines , as well as with the effects of female hormones on the GI tract. There are a few effective constipation treatments.', ""What is Constipation? If you can’t go, it's often because there isn't enough water in your stool, a problem that occurs when you don't drink enough fluids. According to the National Digestive Diseases Information Clearinghouse, part of the National Institutes of Health, constipation is a condition in which you have fewer than three bowel movements in a week, and your stools are hard, dry, and small, making them painful and difficult to pass. Some people naturally have a bowel movement a few times a day, while others go just a few times a week. You don't need constipation treatments unless you're going to the bathroom a lot less often than usual."", 'Constipation Treatments You have a lot of options for treating constipation. What you choose will depend on why you’re blocked, and whether it’s a new or a long-term problem for you.', ""Constipation Home Remedies You may be able to solve your constipation problem yourself, without your doctor’s help. It may seem obvious, but your diet has a big impact on how you poop. Eat more fiber. Fiber makes stool bulkier and softer so it's easier to pass. Gradually increase the amount of fiber in your diet until you're getting at least 20 to 35 grams of fiber daily. Good sources include whole grains found in cereals, breads, and brown rice, beans, vegetables and fresh or dried fruits. Prunes and bran cereal are tried and true constipation remedies. Stay hydrated. Water is important for preventing constipation, too. Try to drink at least 8 glasses of water a day. Try coffee. While caffeinated drinks and alcohol can make you dehydrated, there’s evidence a cup of coffee of tea in the morning may help you poop. Limit high fat/low fiber food. Cheese and other dairy products, processed foods, and meat can make constipation worse. Watch your FODMAPs. Certain carbohydrates cause digestive problems, including constipation, in some people. The names of the carbohydrates are abbreviated “FODMAPs.” Foods that contain them include dairy, apples, broccoli, wheat, and lentils. You might try cutting individual foods from your diet, but do it carefully. A lot of them are good sources of fiber and other nutrients you need."", 'Other things you can do to relieve constipation include: Exercise regularly. Moving your body will keep your bowels moving, too. Adjust your toilet posture. It may be easier to poop if you squat, raise your legs, or lean back. Check your meds. Many prescription drugs can cause constipation. Ask your doctor if this might be the problem and if there’s an alternative. Biofeedback . Some people get constipated because they unconsciously clench their muscles when they try to poop. A therapist can help you train your pelvic floor muscles to relax. Massage. Massaging your own abdomen in a certain pattern can help encourage bowel movements. Enemas. You can irrigate your colon with either tap water or an over-the-counter preparation to soften and flush out the contents. Suppositories. Some over-the-counter constipation medications are meant to be inserted directly into the rectum. They typically work faster than laxatives you take by mouth. Prebiotics and probiotics. You may have digestive issues, including constipation, because of an imbalance in the bacteria that live naturally in your intestines. Supplements or foods containing prebiotics, like bananas and oatmeal, and probiotics, like yogurt and fermented foods, may help.', ""Laxatives for constipation treatment A box of laxatives shouldn't be the first place you turn to relieve constipation. Reserve laxatives for constipation that doesn't improve after you've added fiber and water to your diet. If your doctor recommends laxatives, ask what type is best for you, and for how long you should take them. Laxatives are best taken short-term only, because you don't want to start relying on them to go to the bathroom. Also ask how to ease off laxatives when you no longer need them. Stopping them too abruptly can affect your colon 's ability to contract. Laxatives come in several forms: Bulk-forming fiber supplements include calcium polycarbophil ( Equilactin , Fibercon ), methylcellulose fiber ( Citrucel ), and psyllium ( Fiber-Lax , Konsyl , Metamucil ), and wheat dextrin ( Benefiber ). Unlike other laxatives, you can take these every day. They make the stool bigger and softer. Although they are safe to use regularly, fiber supplements can interfere with your body's ability to absorb certain medicines, and they may cause bloating , cramps , and gas. Drink a lot of water with them. Lubricant laxatives , including Zymenol, help the stool pass more easily through the colon. In general, doctors do not recommend using mineral oil or castor oil. Mineral oil can cause problems such as vitamin deficiencies, and castor oil can lead to long-term constipation. Osmotic laxatives such as lactitol (Pizensy), lactulose ( Kristalose ), magnesium hydroxide ( Milk of Magnesia ), polyethylene glycol ( Miralax ), and Sorbitol help fluids move through your intestines. If you have diabetes , ask your doctor before taking osmotics because they can cause electrolyte imbalances. Stimulant laxatives such as bisacodyl ( Correctol , Dulcolax , Feen-a-Mint ) and sennosides ( Ex-Lax , Senokot ) make the muscles in your intestines contract to help push stool out. These laxatives work quickly, but they can cause side effects, including cramping and diarrhea , so use them for as short a period of time as possible. Stool softeners such as docusate calcium ( Surfak ) and docusate sodium ( Colace ) make stools easier to pass by adding fluid to them. Having softer stool can prevent you from having to strain during bowel movements. Your doctor may recommend one of these products if your constipation is due to childbirth or surgery."", 'Medical Treatment for Constipation Medicine If over-the-counter treatments don’t do the job, your doctor may prescribe a different kind of medication. Prescription laxatives such as linaclotide, ( Linzess ) lubiprostone, ( Amitiza ) and plecanatide ( Trulance ) work by increasing the amount of water in your intestines and speeding up the movement of stool. Note that Amitiza is approved for use only in women. Serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine 4 receptors. Prucalopride (Motegrity) is a powerful stimulant that’s used for chronic constipation without a known cause. PAMORAs. This is a shorter way of saying “peripherally acting mu-opioid receptor antagonists.” These work on constipation that’s caused by opioid pain medicines. These drugs\xa0 include methylnaltrexone (Relistor) and naloxegol (Movantik.) Surgery for constipation treatment Sometimes constipation is caused by a structural problem in your colon or rectum. Your colon may be blocked or unusually narrow, or you may have a partial collapse or a bulge in the wall of your rectum. In that case, surgery can correct the problem. Surgery may also be a last resort if your colon just works too slowly and treatments haven’t helped. You may need to have a section of your colon removed.', ""When Constipation Is a Regular Problem Regardless of what constipation treatment you use, give yourself enough time to sit on the toilet when you need to go. Holding in the urge can make your constipation worse. Set aside a regular time of the day when you know you'll be left undisturbed for several minutes. Also, don't ignore the problem. Untreated constipation can lead to real problems, such as hemorrhoids and tears in the skin around the anus (called fissures) that make you bleed. If you strain too hard, you might even cause part of your intestines to push out through the anus -- a condition called rectal prolapse that can sometimes require surgery. Call your doctor right away if you have any of these symptoms with constipation: Stomach pain Blood in your stools Unexplained weight loss Inability to have a bowel movement Also, call if you've been having trouble going for more than three weeks and constipation treatments aren't working. You may have a condition called Chronic Idiopathic Constipation (CIC) which means your constipation may be caused by something other than physical or physiological.""]"

Common symptoms include: Trouble telling how near or far away something is (depth perception) Squinting or shutting one eye Head tilting', 'Lazy Eye Causes Doctors don’t always know what’s behind some cases of amblyopia. Causes may include: Refractive errors. One eye might have much better focus than the other. The other eye could be nearsighted or farsighted. Or it could have astigmatism (distorted or blurry vision). When your brain gets both a blurry image and a clear one, it starts to ignore the blurry one. If this goes on for months or years, vision in the blurry eye will get worse. Strabismus. This is when your eyes don’t line up the way they should. One could turn in or out. People who have strabismus can’t focus their eyes together on an image, so they often see double. Your brain\xa0will ignore the image from the eye that isn’t aligned. Cataracts. A cloudy lens inside your eye can make things look blurry. The vision in that eye might not develop the way it should. Droopy eyelid (ptosis). A sagging eyelid can block your vision.', 'Lazy Eye Risk Factors A child might be more likely to have a lazy eye if they: Were born early (premature) Were smaller than average at birth Have a family history of amblyopia or other eye conditions Have developmental disabilities', ""Lazy Eye Diagnosis All children should have vision tests before they are school-age. Your child's doctor or the vision program at school will check to make sure that: Nothing blocks the light coming into their eyes Both eyes see equally well Each eye moves the way it should"", ""If there's any problem, the doctor or school nurse may suggest that you take your child to an eye specialist. If you feel like something is wrong with your child's vision -- even if nothing shows up at the vision check -- make an appointment with a pediatric eye doctor. Some eye care experts say kids should get an eye exam at 6 months old, 3 years old, and then every\xa0year while they’re in school. Ask your doctor what’s right for your child. Eye doctors test babies and young children by watching how well their eyes follow a moving object. They may also cover one eye at a time and check the child’s reaction. In older kids, the doctor will cover one eye and use pictures and letters to check their vision."", 'Lazy Eye Treatment It’s important to start treatment for amblyopia as soon as possible. Depending on the cause, it might involve: Correcting any underlying vision problems such as nearsightedness , farsightedness , or astigmatism . Most kids with amblyopia also need glasses to help their eyes focus. Surgery, if a cataract is blocking light from their eye or if strabismus keeps their eyes from moving together the way they should Wearing a patch over the strong eye to force their brain to use the weak one. At first, your child will have a hard time seeing. Their vision will get better, though it might take weeks or months. After that, they won’t have to wear the patch all the time.

15,Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome,"[""What Is Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome? Lennox-Gastaut syndrome ( LGS ) is a rare and severe kind of epilepsy that starts in childhood. Children with LGS have seizures often, and they have several different kinds of seizures. This condition is hard to treat, but researchers are looking for new therapies. Finding practical and emotional support is key to help you give your child the best quality of life while facing the challenges and stress this illness brings. The seizures usually start between ages 2 and 6. Children with LGS have learning difficulties and developmental delays (like sitting, crawling, walking) that can be moderate to severe. They can also have behavioral problems. Each child develops differently, and it's impossible to predict how a child with LGS will do. While most children have ongoing seizures and some form of learning disability , some may respond well to treatment and have fewer seizures. Others may continue to have seizures often, as well as problems with thinking, development, and behavior, and will need help with daily living activities. Some parents find that a special diet, called the ketogenic diet , helps."", ""Causes Doctors don't always know what caused a child's LGS. In some cases, it could be caused by: Lack of oxygen during birth Severe brain injuries linked with pregnancy or birth, such as low birth weight or premature birth Brain infections (such as encephalitis , meningitis , or rubella) Seizures that start in infancy, called infantile spasms or West’s syndrome A brain problem called cortical dysplasia, where some nerve fibers in the brain don’t line up right during development in the womb Tuberous sclerosis , where non-cancerous tumors form in many places throughout the body, including the brain Genetics"", 'Symptoms Children with LGS have frequent and severe seizures. And they often have different kinds of seizures, including: Atonic seizures. Also called ""drop attacks,"" because the person loses muscle tone and can fall to the ground. Their muscles may jerk. These seizures are brief, usually lasting a few seconds. Tonic seizures. These seizures cause the person\'s body to stiffen and can last for a few seconds to a minute. They usually happen when the person is asleep. If they happen when the person is awake, they can cause falls. Like atonic seizures, they are also called drop attacks.', 'Absence seizures . During these seizures, a person may have a blank stare or nod their head or blink quickly. In some children, the first sign of LGS is an ongoing seizure that lasts 30 minutes, or continuous seizures without full recovery between them. This is called status epilepticus, and it is a medical emergency. People with LGS may also have slower reaction time. Some have problems learning and processing information. They may have behavioral problems, too.', 'Getting a Diagnosis Your doctor will want to know: When did you first notice a problem? Has your child had seizures? How many? How frequent? How long did it last, and how would you describe what happened? Does your child have any medical conditions or take any medications ? Were there any complications during birth? Do you know if your child has any brain injuries? Does your child have problems with learning or behavior? Your doctor will look for three signs to diagnose LGS: Multiple kinds of seizures that are hard to control Developmental delays or intellectual disability An electroencephalogram (EEG) that shows a specific kind of pattern, called a slow spike-wave pattern, between seizures. An EEG uses a machine to record electrical activity in the brain.', 'Questions for Your Doctor Does my child need any more tests? Have you treated other children with this condition? What treatment do you recommend? How will treatment make my child feel? What can I do to keep my child safe during seizures? Are there clinical trials my child could take part in? How do I connect with other families who have children with LGS?', ""Treatment Medications Doctors may prescribe a variety of drugs to treat seizures from LGS. The goal is to reduce the number of seizures with medication that causes the fewest side effects. Finding the right treatment for your child will probably take time and close coordination with the doctor. Drugs used to treat seizures include: Cannabidiol ( Epidiolex ) Clobazam ( Onfi ) Felbamate ( Felbatol ) Lamotrigine ( Lamictal ) Rufinamide ( Banzel ) Topiramate ( Topamax ) Valproate , valproic acid (Depakene, Depakote ) Usually, no single medication controls seizures completely. The doctor will monitor your child's medication closely, especially if your child takes more than one at a time."", ""Diets A special high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet, called the ketogenic diet, helps some people with epilepsy , including some children with LGS. It's a high-fat, low-protein, low-carb diet. It has to be started in a specific way and followed very strictly, so you need a doctor's supervision. Your doctor will watch closely to see whether or when any medication levels can be lowered. Because the diet is so specific, your child may need to take vitamin or mineral supplements . Doctors aren't sure why the ketogenic diet works, but some studies show that children with epilepsy who stay on the diet have a better chance of reducing their seizures or their medications. For some kids, a modified Atkins diet may work, too. It is slightly different from the ketogenic diet. You don't have to restrict calories, protein, or fluids. Also, you don't weigh or measure foods. Instead, you monitor carbohydrates. People with seizures that are hard to treat have also tried a low glycemic index diet . This diet focuses on the type of carbs, as well as the amount, that someone eats."", ""Medical Marijuana A lot of attention has been focused on using medical marijuana to treat children with epilepsy, and many families are interested in learning more. Doctors haven't yet studied the use of medical marijuana in children who have LGS, and most of the studies using it to treat epilepsy have focused on short-term benefits. According to the Lennox-Gastaut Foundation, more research is needed to find out if this is a safe and effective treatment for children with LGS. Surgery If medications and other treatments aren't reducing the number of seizures, your doctor may suggest surgery. The vagus nerve stimulator is a small device placed in the arm or near the chest. It sends electrical impulses to the vagus nerve, which runs from the abdomen to the brain. The nerve then sends those impulses to the brain to help control seizures. The surgery is done under general anesthesia and takes about an hour. The RNS stimulator is a device that's placed inside the skull and is connected to the brain. It senses any abnormal electrical activity and then sends electrical impulses to the brain to try to keep seizures from happening. Corpus callosotomy divides the left and right hemispheres of the brain. That keeps seizures that start in one part of the brain from spreading to the opposite side. It is usually suggested only for people who have severe, uncontrollable seizures that cause them to fall and get hurt. Someone who has corpus callosotomy will need to stay in the hospital for 2 to 4 days, and will keep taking anti-seizure drugs after they go home."", ""What to Expect Parenting a child with LGS is tough. If your child has frequent seizures, they may need to wear a helmet to protect them if they fall. You may have to deal with behavioral problems like acting out, and side effects from anti-seizure drugs. There is no cure for LGS, although there is a lot of research to find treatments that work better. Each child with LGS has different needs. Most continue to have seizures and intellectual disabilities after they grow up. Some may be able to live independently, but most will need help with daily activities. They may need to live in a group or assisted living home. It's important for parents and siblings to get the support they need as caregivers and family members facing life with this severe condition. Talking with other families facing the same challenges can help you feel less isolated, and getting tips and information from others can make daily life easier."", 'Getting Support To learn more about Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, you can visit the web site of the LGS Foundation .

16,Muscular Dystrophy,"['What Is Muscular Dystrophy? Muscular dystrophy (MD) is a group of inherited diseases in which the muscles that control movement (called voluntary muscles) progressively weaken. In some forms of this disease, the heart and other organs are also affected. There are nine major forms of muscular dystrophy: Myotonic Duchenne Becker Limb-girdle Facioscapulohumeral Congenital Oculopharyngeal Distal Emery-Dreifuss Muscular dystrophy can appear in infancy up to middle age or later, and its form and severity are determined in part by the age at which it occurs. Some types of muscular dystrophy typicallyaffect only males; some people with MD enjoy a normal life span with mild symptoms that progress very slowly; others experience swift and severe muscle weakness and wasting, dying in their late teens to early 20s. The various types of MD affect more than 50,000 Americans. Through advances in medical care, children with muscular dystrophy are living longer than ever before.', ""Muscular Dystrophy Symptoms by Type Myotonic (also called MMD or Steinert's disease). The most common form of muscular dystrophy in adults, myotonic muscular dystrophy affects both men and women, and it usually appears any time from early childhood to adulthood. In rare cases, it appears in newborns (congenital MMD). The name refers to a symptom, myotonia -- prolonged spasm or stiffening of muscles after use. This symptom is usually worse in cold temperatures. The disease causes muscle weakness and also affects the central nervous system , heart , gastrointestinal tract, eyes , and hormone-producing glands. In most cases, daily living isn't restricted for many years. Those with myotonic MD have a decreased life expectancy. Duchenne. The most common form of muscular dystrophy in children, Duchenne muscular dystrophy typically affects only males. It appears between the ages of 2 and 6. The muscles decrease in size and grow weaker over time yet may appear larger. Disease progression varies, but many people with Duchenne (1 in 3,500 boys) need a wheelchair by the age of 12. In most cases, the arms, legs, and spine become progressively deformed, and there may be some cognitive impairment. Severe breathing and heart problems mark the later stages of the disease. Those with Duchenne MD usually die in their late teens or early 20s. Becker. This form is similar to Duchenne muscular dystrophy, but the disease is much milder: symptoms appear later and progress more slowly. It usually appears between the ages of 2 and 16 but can appear as late as age 25. Like Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Becker muscular dystrophy typically affects only males (1 in 30,000) and causes heart problems. Disease severity varies. Those with Becker can usually walk into their 30s and live further into adulthood. Limb-girdle. This appears in the teens to early adulthood and affects males and females. In its most common form, Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy causes progressive weakness that begins in the hips and moves to the shoulders, arms, and legs and the heart may be affected. Within 20 years, walking becomes difficult or impossible. Sufferers typically live to middle age to late adulthood. Facioscapulohumeral. Facioscapulohumeral refers to the muscles that move the face, shoulder blade, and upper arm bone . This form of muscular dystrophy appears in the teens to early adulthood and affects males and females. It progresses slowly, with short periods of rapid muscle deterioration and weakness. Severity ranges from very mild to completely disabling. Walking, chewing, swallowing, and speaking problems can occur. About 50% of those with facioscapulohumeral MD can walk throughout their lives, and most live a normal life span. It may also bee associated with seizures, mental health problems, and can involve the heart Congenital. Congenital means present at birth. Congenital muscular dystrophies progress slowly and affect males and females. The two forms that have been identified -- Fukuyama and congenital muscular dystrophy with myosin deficiency -- cause muscle weakness at birth or in the first few months of life, along with severe and early contractures (shortening or shrinking of muscles that causes joint problems). Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy causes abnormalities in the brain and often seizures . Oculopharyngeal. Oculopharyngeal means eye and throat. This form of muscular dystrophy appears in men and women in their 40s, 50s, and 60s. It progresses slowly, causing weakness in the eye and face muscles, which may lead to difficulty swallowing. Weakness in pelvic and shoulder muscles may occur later. Choking and recurrent pneumonia may occur. Distal. This group of rare diseases affects adult men and women. It causes weakness and wasting of the distal muscles (those farthest from the center) of the forearms, hands, lower legs, and feet . It is generally less severe, progresses more slowly, and affects fewer muscles than other forms of muscular dystrophy. Emery-Dreifuss. This rare form of muscular dystrophy appears from childhood to the early teens and affects mainly males. In very rare cases, females can be affected. For that to happen, both of a girls X chromosomes (the one they get from their mother and the one from their father) would have to have the defective gene. It causes muscle weakness and wasting in the shoulders, upper arms, and lower legs. Life-threatening heart problems are common and can also affect carriers -- those who have the genetic information for the disease but do not develop the full-blown version (including mothers and sisters of those with Emery-Dreifuss MD). Muscle shortening (contractures) occurs early in the disease. Weakness can spread to chest and pelvic muscles. The disease progresses slowly and causes less severe muscle weakness than some other forms of muscular dystrophy."", ""Muscular Dystrophy Causes and Risk Factors Muscular dystrophy is caused by defects in certain genes, with type determined by the abnormal gene. In 1986, researchers discovered the gene that, when defective or flawed, causes Duchenne muscular dystrophy. In 1987, the muscle protein associated with this gene was named dystrophin. Duchenne muscular dystrophy occurs when that gene fails to make dystrophin. Becker muscular dystrophy occurs when a different mutation in the same gene results in some dystrophin, but it's either not enough or it's poor in quality. Scientists have discovered and continue to search for the genetic defects that cause other forms of muscular dystrophy."", ""Most of the muscular dystrophies are a form of inherited disease called X-linked disorders or genetic diseases that mothers can transmit to their sons even though the mothers themselves are unaffected by the disease. Men carry one X chromosome and one Y chromosome. Females carry two X chromosomes. Thus, in order for a girl to become affected by muscular dystrophy, both their X chromosomes would have to carry the defective gene -- an extremely rare occurrence, since their mother would have to be a carrier (one defective X chromosome) and their father would have to have muscular dystrophy (since men carry just one X chromosome, the other is a Y chromosome). A female who carries the defective X chromosome can pass the disease to their son (whose other chromosome is a Y, from the father). A few muscular dystrophies aren't inherited at all and occur because of a new gene abnormality or mutation."", 'Muscular Dystrophy Diagnosis To start, your doctor will examine your child and ask questions about medical and family health history. Muscular dystrophy is diagnosed using several different tests. These may include:', 'Muscle biopsy . A small piece of muscle tissue is removed and examined to confirm the diagnosis or rule out another muscle disease. Genetic ( DNA ) testing. Genes passed down through families can cause some forms of muscular dystrophy. A blood test can determine if you or your child has the gene. Neurological tests. Various tests are done to check nervous system function, reflexes, and coordination. One example is a nerve conduction study, also called a nerve function test, or electromyography (EMG).', 'Enzyme tests. These are blood tests that check for proteins, or enzymes, linked to muscle weakness. People with muscular dystrophy have high levels of the enzyme creatine kinase. It’s made when muscles are damaged. They also have higher levels of serum aldolase, which is made when your body breaks down sugar into energy. Heart monitoring. An electrocardiogram may be done to check for an abnormal heartbeat . Some types of muscular dystrophy cause irregular heartbeats. MRI or ultrasound . These imaging tests give the doctor a look at muscle quality and can reveal if fat is replacing muscle tissue.', 'Muscular Dystrophy Treatment There is no cure for muscular dystrophy, but treatments can help manage symptoms and improve quality of life. Medications Prescription drugs are available to control muscular dystrophy symptoms or slow their progression. Medications for muscular dystrophy include: Steroids . Corticosteroids, such as prednisone and deflazacort (Emflaza), are the standard of care for muscular dystrophy. They help improve muscle strength and breathing and decrease weakness. Side effects include high blood pressure and weight gain . People who use steroids for a long time are at risk for brittle bones. Medicines targeting gene mutations. Eteplirsen (Exondys 51) and golodirsen (Vyondys 53) increase the level of the gene dystrophin. They’re approved to specifically treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Anticonvulsants. Often used to treat epilepsy , these antiseizure drugs may also help reduce muscle spasms . Immunosuppressants. These powerful medicines are often used to treat lupus and other autoimmune diseases . When given to people with muscular dystrophy, they may help prevent some muscle cell damage. Antibiotics. The doctor may prescribe an antibiotic to treat a lung infection, which is common in people with muscular dystrophy.', 'Physical therapy Physical therapy helps keep joints and muscles flexible. It’s an important part of a muscular dystrophy treatment plan. The goal of physical therapy is to improve strength in the large muscle groups and prevent scoliosis and contractures. Physical therapy for muscular dystrophy may involve: Range of motion exercises Stretching Low-impact workouts, such as swimming or water exercise (aquatic therapy)', 'Respiratory care Muscle weakness can affect the lungs, making breathing difficult. A respiratory therapist can teach you and your child how to properly use a mask, nose device, or mouthpiece. Mobility and positioning aids Braces, walkers, or wheelchairs help provide mobility and independence to people with muscular dystrophy. Standing with a walker, even for just a little bit each day, boosts blood flow and helps build better bones. Speech therapy Muscle weakness in the face and throat can make speaking difficult. Learning how to properly pace breathing and talking can be helpful. A speech therapist can also show you how to use speech communication devices.', 'Surgery Surgery may be recommended to manage or correct complications of muscular dystrophy. For example, cataract surgery may be done to replace a cloudy eye lens. Or a person with muscular dystrophy may need spinal fusion surgery to treat scoliosis, or heart surgery to implant a pacemaker .', 'Muscular Dystrophy Complications The complications of muscular dystrophy depend on the type. Some types are mild, while others are serious and get worse very fast. Worsening muscle weakness can affect the ability to walk, breathe, swallow, and speak. Complications of muscular dystrophy can include: Breathing problems . Progressive weakness in the breathing muscles (diaphragm) makes it hard to take a breath. That raises the risk for lung infections such as pneumonia. Curving of the spine (scoliosis). Weakness in the muscles supporting the backbone causes the spine to become curved. Most people with Duchenne muscular dystrophy need scoliosis surgery. Heart problems. Some types of muscular dystrophy cause abnormal and dangerous changes in the heartbeat. You need a pacemaker to regulate it. Muscular dystrophy can also cause the heart muscle to become weak ( cardiomyopathy ). That leads to heart failure .', 'Swallowing difficulty. Weakness affects the muscles in the esophagus , and causes problems with chewing and swallowing. This can lead to choking. Some people with muscular dystrophy will need a feeding tube . Shortening of the tendons or muscles around the joints (contractures). Bracing and tendon release surgery can help prevent some contractures. Vision problems. Some types of muscular dystrophy cause clouding of the eye lens ( cataracts ). Need for a wheelchair. Weakness in the large muscles of the legs makes it difficult to walk, stand, kneel, or climb. Some people with muscular dystrophy eventually need to use a wheelchair.']"
17,What Are Lice? How Do You Know If You Have Them?,"['The thought of lice might give you the creepy crawlies -- and with good reason. When these tiny mites infect the scalp and skin , they trigger intense itching and may even create a rash around the hairline. There are different types of lice . The type you have depends on the part of your body that’s affected: Head lice affect the scalp. Pubic lice (also called “crabs”) affect your genital area. Body lice affect other areas of the body and are often found in seams of clothing. View more\xa0images This article will focus on head lice, a very common condition among kids in elementary and middle school. About 6 million to 12 million of them get it every year. Head lice are most active at night. They can cause such intense itching that your child could lose sleep over it. It’s uncomfortable, but lice won’t make you sick. They don’t spread disease and they’re not a sign that you’re dirty. You can get lice even if you shower regularly and have super-clean hair . These pesky creatures don’t fly or jump -- they crawl over to the closest head they can find. This is called head-to-head contact, and most people get lice this way. But they also can spread onto hats, helmets, combs, bedding, pillows – even earbuds. Young children may get or spread lice when crawling on rugs. It’s important to know the early signs of lice. Then you can take steps to keep your child comfortable and keep the mites from spreading throughout your home.', 'Identifying Lice These pests are a type of insect called a parasite . They need human blood to live. Head lice usually stay close to the scalp and behind the ears. You might also spot them on the eyebrows and eyelashes. Body Lice. The dark mass in the abdomen of this female body louse is ingested blood, showing she has been feeding on her human host. Body lice are parasitic insects that can rely on their human hosts but can also make their home in clothing or bedding. An infestation can spread rapidly under crowded conditions. Lice are resilient. You may notice the tiny hairs on this louse’s body which help her detect environmental changes that may affect her survival. Female adult lice lay six to eight eggs a day on your scalp, and they spread from there. There are three forms of lice to watch for: Nits, or lice eggs. They’re very tiny -- about half\xa0the size of a pinhead. They’re hard to see. The oval-shaped eggs often look yellow or white but may be the same color as your hair . They are found on the first 1-2 inches of hair shaft closest to the scalp (not the end) and are hard to remove. You may confuse them with dandruff or flakes from hairspray build-up. Head lice nits usually hatch in 8 to 9 days. When they do, they leave behind clear shells, which remain stuck to the hair shaft and appear more grey in color. A nymph is a baby louse (singular for lice). It’s what hatches from the nit. It feeds on the blood on your scalp and keeps growing for 9 to 12 days. Nymphs (and adult lice) move quickly and avoid light. Mites begin to appear in your hair, on your skin, and on anything your head has touched. Itching might not start right away. Adult lice are about 2 to 3 millimeters long, about the size of a sesame seed. They’re tan or grayish-white. The color can be lighter or darker.\xa0Adult lice have six legs with claws at the end that allow them to latch tightly to your hair. Typically, adult head lice live 30 days when stuck to your head. If they fall off, they die within 1 to 2 days. If you spot lice, tell your child’s school so they can properly clean classroom items and stop the spread. The CDC says lice aren’t a medical hazard, and most health departments don’t require that you report it. But local school boards make their own school lice policies. Check with your child’s school to find out its policy.']"
18,Amyloidosis,"['Amyloidosis is when an abnormal protein called amyloid builds up in your tissues and organs. When it does, it affects their shape and how they work. Amyloidosis is a serious health problem that can lead to life-threatening organ failure.', 'Causes and Types of Amyloidosis Many different proteins can lead to amyloid deposits, but only a few have been linked to major health problems. The type of protein and where it collects tells the type of amyloidosis you have. Amyloid deposits may collect throughout your body or in just one area. The different types of amyloidosis include: AL amyloidosis (immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis). This is the most common type and used to be called primary amyloidosis. AL stands for “amyloid light chains,” which is the type of protein responsible for the condition. There’s no known cause, but it happens when your bone marrow makes abnormal antibodies that can’t be broken down. It’s linked with a blood cancer called multiple myeloma. It can affect your kidneys, heart, liver, intestines, and nerves.', ""AA amyloidosis. Previously known as secondary amyloidosis, this condition is the result of another chronic infectious or inflammatory disease such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn’s disease, or ulcerative colitis. It mostly affects your kidneys, but it can also affect your digestive tract, liver, and heart. AA means the amyloid type A protein causes this type. Dialysis-related amyloidosis (DRA). This is more common in older adults and people who have been on dialysis for more than 5 years. This form of amyloidosis is caused by deposits of beta-2 microglobulin that build up in the blood. Deposits can build up in many different tissues, but it most commonly affects bones, joints, and tendons. Familial, or hereditary, amyloidosis. This is a rare form passed down through families. It often affects the liver, nerves, heart, and kidneys. Many genetic defects are linked to a higher chance of amyloid disease. For example, an abnormal protein like transthyretin (TTR) is usually the cause. Age-related (senile) systemic amyloidosis. This is caused by deposits of normal TTR in the heart and other tissues. It happens most commonly in older men. Organ-specific amyloidosis. This causes deposits of amyloid protein in single organs, including the skin (cutaneous amyloidosis). Though some types of amyloid deposits have been linked to Alzheimer's disease, the brain is rarely affected by amyloidosis that happens throughout your body."", 'Risk Factors for Amyloidosis Men get amyloidosis more often than women. Your risk for amyloidosis goes up as you grow older. Amyloidosis affects 15% of patients with a form of cancer called multiple myeloma. Amyloidosis may also happen in people with end-stage kidney disease who are on dialysis for a long time (see ""Dialysis-related amyloidosis"" above).', 'Symptoms of Amyloidosis Symptoms of amyloidosis are often subtle. They can also vary greatly depending on where the amyloid protein is collecting in the body. It is important to note that the symptoms described below may be due to a variety of health problems. Only your doctor can make a diagnosis of amyloidosis. General symptoms of amyloidosis may include: Changes in skin color Severe fatigue Feeling of fullness Joint pain Low red blood cell count (anemia) Shortness of breath Swelling of the tongue Tingling and numbness in legs and feet Weak hand grip Severe weakness Sudden weight loss', 'Cardiac Amyloidosis (Stiff Heart Syndrome) This condition can cause less blood to flow to your heart muscle. Eventually, your heart will no longer be able to pump normally.', ""Some doctors also call cardiac amyloidosis “stiff heart syndrome.” Others say a stiff heart is actually a symptom of cardiac amyloidosis. Either way, amyloid deposits in your heart can make the muscular walls of your heart stiff. They can also make your heart muscle weaker and affect the electrical rhythm of the heart. Stiff heart syndrome can be serious. It may lead to congestive heart failure if it's not successfully treated. Who’s at risk? Cardiac amyloidosis is more common in men than in women. It’s also more likely to affect older people. People under 40 rarely get the condition. You can inherit stiff heart syndrome. Other things that raise your chances of getting it are: Having untreated high blood pressure Being obese Being over 60 Having gone through menopause What are the symptoms? If amyloidosis affects your heart, some symptoms you might notice are: Shortness of breath when you're doing light activity or lying down An irregular heartbeat Signs of heart failure, including swelling of the feet and ankles, weakness, fatigue, and nausea, among others"", ""These can be signs of other health conditions, too. So see your doctor to figure out what’s going on. How is it diagnosed? Your doctor will ask you about your symptoms and whether anyone in your family has cardiac amyloidosis or other heart conditions. They’ll give you a physical exam, too. The doctor may do several tests to diagnose or rule out cardiac amyloidosis, like: Blood and urine tests Imaging tests to see inside your body, like ultrasound, echocardiogram, electrocardiogram, MRI, or CT scan Biopsy Genetic testing, if cardiac amyloidosis runs in your family What are the treatments? There’s more than one type of cardiac amyloidosis. Your treatment will depend on the type you have. Among the options your doctor might recommend are: Medications, including chemotherapy and immunotherapy A pacemaker A stem cell transplant While some of these treatments, like chemo and immunotherapy, are also used to treat cancer, cardiac amyloidosis isn't cancer. It's a disease that affects the heart muscle. There's no cure, but there are treatments for most types of cardiac amyloidosis. Getting an early diagnosis is important since treatment can prevent permanent damage."", 'Renal (Kidney) Amyloidosis Your kidneys filter waste and toxins from your blood. Amyloid deposits in the kidneys make it hard for them to do this job. When your kidneys do not work properly, water and dangerous toxins build up in your body. If amyloidosis affects the kidneys, you may have: Signs of kidney failure, including swelling of the feet and ankles and puffiness around the eyes High levels of protein in your urine', 'Gastrointestinal Amyloidosis Amyloid deposits along your gastrointestinal (GI) tract slow down the movement of food through your intestines. This interferes with digestion. If amyloidosis affects your GI tract, you may have: Less appetite Diarrhea Nausea Stomach pain Weight loss If your liver is affected, that can cause liver enlargement and fluid buildup in the body.', ""Amyloid Neuropathy Amyloid deposits can damage the nerves outside your brain and spinal cord, called the peripheral nerves. The peripheral nerves carry information between your brain and spinal cord and the rest of your body. For example, they make your brain perceive pain if you burn your hand or stub your toes. If amyloidosis affects your nerves, you may have: Balance problems Problems controlling your bladder and bowel Sweating problems Tingling and weakness Lightheadedness when standing due to a problem with your body's ability to control blood pressure"", ""Diagnosing Amyloidosis A thorough physical exam and a detailed and accurate account of your medical history are crucial in helping your doctor diagnose amyloidosis. Blood and urine tests can spot abnormal proteins. Depending on your symptoms, your doctor may also check your thyroid and liver. Your doctor will do a biopsy to confirm a diagnosis of amyloidosis and know the specific type of protein you have. The tissue sample for the biopsy may be taken from your belly fat (the abdominal fat pad), bone marrow, or sometimes your mouth, rectum, or other organs. It's not always necessary to biopsy the part of the body damaged by the amyloid deposits. Imaging tests can also help. They show the amount of damage to organs like your heart, liver, or spleen. Your doctor will do a genetic test if they think you have a type that is passed down through families. Treatment for hereditary amyloidosis is different from treatment for other types of the disease. Once you’re diagnosed, your doctor might check your heart with an echocardiogram or your liver and spleen with imaging tests."", 'Amyloidosis Treatment There is no cure for amyloidosis. Your doctor will prescribe treatments to slow the development of the amyloid protein and manage your symptoms. If amyloidosis is related to another condition, then treatment will include targeting that underlying condition. Specific treatment depends on what type of amyloidosis you have and how many organs are affected. High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant can help remove the substance that leads to amyloid formation in some people with primary AL amyloidosis. Chemotherapy medicines alone may be used to treat other patients with primary AL amyloidosis. Secondary (AA) amyloidosis is treated by controlling the underlying disorder and with powerful anti-inflammatory medicines called steroids, which fight inflammation. A liver transplant may treat\xa0the disease if you have certain types of hereditary amyloidosis. New therapies can slow the production of the abnormal protein TTR. Your doctor might also recommend a kidney transplant. Other treatments to help with symptoms include: Diuretic medicine to remove extra water from your body Thickeners to add to fluids to prevent choking if you have trouble swallowing Compression stockings to relieve swelling in your legs or feet Changes to what you eat, especially if you have gastrointestinal amyloidosis', 'What to Expect Amyloidosis can be deadly, especially if it affects your heart or kidneys. Early diagnosis and treatment are important and can help improve survival. Researchers continue to question why some types of amyloid make people sick and how the formation of amyloid can be stopped. Studies to find new treatments are ongoing. If you have amyloidosis, consider asking your doctor if there are any clinical trials you can join, or search for one by visiting www.clinicaltrials.gov and typing in the search term ""amyloidosis.""']"

Eczema is a common skin condition, and atopic dermatitis (also called atopic eczema) is one of the most common forms of eczema . It can affect adults or children and isn’t contagious. The way eczema looks can vary from person to person. In adults, eczema most often affects the hands, elbows, and back of your knees. In young children, eczema often also shows up on the face, back of the neck, and scalp. Some things can trigger a flare-up of eczema or make eczema worse, but they don’t cause the condition. Hives Hives is a skin condition that causes raised, itchy bumps or welts. If you have hives, you could be allergic to something airborne or an insect bite. It can also be caused by changes in the temperature and bacterial infections.', ""Contact dermatitis The type of rash that comes from contact dermatitis happens when your body reacts to irritants such as detergents, fragrances, and chemicals. It can cause inflammation, itchiness, and redness. Granuloma annulare Granuloma annulare is a chronic skin condition. A circular-shaped rash with reddish bumps (papules) is a common symptom. Most often, it affects children and young adults. It's slightly more common in girls and is usually seen in people who are otherwise healthy. If you have granuloma annulare, you'll usually notice one or more rings of small, firm bumps over the back of your forearms, hands, or feet . The rash may be mildly itchy. Lichen planus Lichen planus is a common skin condition that causes shiny, flat-topped bumps. They often have an angular shape and a reddish-purplish color. Li chen planus can show up anywhere on the skin but often affects the insides of your wrists and ankles , lower legs, back, and neck.

Injections can be used to treat rashes that come from certain skin conditions. Dupilumab ( Dupixent ), for example, is an injectable monoclonal antibody used in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. It clears the itch quickly in most patients. Cortisone shots can also be used in more severe cases. Phototherapy (light therapy). This is another treatment that helps some people with eczema. Phototherapy uses ultraviolet light, either ultraviolet A (UVA) or ultraviolet B (UVB), from special lamps to treat people with severe cases.

Triggers may be respiratory infections, strep throat , tonsillitis , stress, injury to the skin, or taking antimalarial or beta-blocker medications. Inverse psoriasis , which causes discolored, shiny lesions that appear in skin folds, such as the armpits, groin, and under the breasts. On light skin, the lesions will be bright red. On darker skin, they'll be darker than the surrounding skin and can be purplish or brown in color. Erythrodermic psoriasis , which causes intense discoloration of the skin and shedding of scales in sheets. It's triggered by bad sunburn, infections, certain medications, and stopping some kinds of psoriasis treatment . It needs to be treated immediately because it can lead to severe illness."", ""What Causes Psoriasis? No one knows the exact cause of psoriasis , but experts believe it’s a combination of things. Something sets off your immune system , which causes inflammation. That triggers new skin cells to form too quickly. Normally, skin cells are replaced every 10-30 days. With psoriasis, new cells grow every 3-4 days. The buildup of old cells being replaced by new ones creates the scales. Psoriasis tends to run in families, but it may skip generations. For instance, a grandfather and their grandson may be affected, but not the child's mother.

They control your eye and hair color, your ability to taste certain things, and the other ways your body works. Some genes are active only at certain times. When you have psoriasis, the genes that control your immune system’s signals get mixed up. Instead of protecting your body from invaders, as it's meant to do, it promotes inflammation and turns skin cells on overdrive . Scientists have found more than 80 genes that are different in people with psoriasis. They think it takes more than one gene to cause the disease, and they're looking for the main ones. About 10 in every 100 people have genes that make them more likely to get psoriasis, but only two or three of them actually do. Alcohol :\xa0People who drink a lot are at a higher risk, especially younger men. Also, alcohol can make treatments less effective. Smoking : Lighting up can double your risk of getting psoriasis.

But sometimes the body isn't able to resume the work."", 'Reasons for Life Support If these systems stop working for any reason, you need life support: Lungs : In cases of near-drowning, pneumonia, drug overdose, a blood clot , and severe lung injury or disease, such as COPD and cystic fibrosis , and muscle or nerve diseases such as ALS and muscular dystrophy Heart : Sudden cardiac arrest or heart attack Brain : Stroke or a severe blow to the head', ""Types of Life Support When most people talk about a person being on life support, they're usually talking about a ventilator, which is a machine that helps someone breathe. A ventilator keeps oxygen flowing throughout the body by pushing air into the lungs . It's used temporarily for conditions like pneumonia, but it may be needed longer for someone with lung failure."", ""One end of a tube goes into the windpipe through the nose or mouth. The other end attaches to the electric pump. Some people get medicine to make them more comfortable and sleepy while on a breathing machine. When a person's heart stops, doctors will try to restart it. These life support methods include CPR, which keeps blood and oxygen flowing throughout the body, electric shocks (called defibrillation) to get the heart beating again, and medication to help the heart work. Less urgent forms of life support include dialysis to filter toxins from the blood , and a feeding tube or an IV to give nutrition and water."", ""Starting Life Support Doctors, nurses, and other health care professionals will begin life support immediately unless: You decline it outright. You left written instructions saying you don't want it. Your medical power of attorney or closest family member, with the right to make decisions for you, turns it down on your behalf."", ""Stopping Life Support Doctors usually advise stopping life support when there is no hope left for recovery. The organs are no longer able to function on their own. Keeping the treatment going at that point may draw out the process of dying and may also be costly. Choosing to remove life support usually means that the person will die within hours or days. The timing depends on what treatment is stopped. People tend to stop breathing and die soon after a ventilator shuts off, though some do start breathing again on their own. If they are not taking in any fluids, they will usually die within several days of a feeding tube removal, though they may survive for as long as a week or two. When someone is unconscious or not of sound mind, doctors and family members decide when life support measures should stop. It's a hard decision, especially if the sick person hasn't previously discussed their end-of-life wishes with their family. Doctors encourage family members to focus on what they think their loved one would want. It's important to remember that it's the underlying condition, not the removal of life support, that actually causes someone to die, and doctors will do all they can to keep your loved one comfortable.""]"
25,Fissured Tongue,"[""If you have fissures in your tongue , it's likely no cause for concern. In fact, certain types of grooves or cracks are considered simply a variation of a normal tongue . Sometimes called a plicated or scrotal tongue , this condition is often harmless. However, it's rarely a good idea to diagnose yourself. So, if you have any concerns, set your mind at ease by discussing this with your doctor or oral specialist."", 'Characteristics of Fissured Tongue These are the characteristics of a fissured tongue: Cracks, grooves, or clefts appear on the top and sides of the tongue. These fissures only affect your tongue. Fissures on the tongue vary in depth, but they may be as deep as 6 millimeters. Grooves may connect with other grooves, separating the tongue into small lobes or sections. Unless debris builds up in these fissures, you are unlikely to have any symptoms. Fissures may first appear during childhood. However, fissures are more common in adults. And, just as wrinkles can deepen with age, fissures can also become more pronounced as you get older. If you have regular dental exams, your dentist has no doubt spotted the fissures on your tongue. This is how most fissures are found.', ""Conditions Associated With Fissured Tongue About 2% to 5% of the U.S. population has a fissured tongue. A fissured tongue may affect men slightly more often than women. Because a fissured tongue can cluster in families, it may be genetically inherited. Although other causes of fissured tongue are unknown, it may appear along with other conditions such as these: Geographic tongue, also known as benign migratory glossitis (BMG). This benign condition often shows up along with fissured tongue. It may cause no symptoms other than sensitivity to hot and spicy foods. Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome. This is a rare condition. It not only causes a fissured tongue, but also lip or facial swelling and paralysis in the face ( Bell's palsy ) that may come and go. Down syndrome . Fissured tongue occurs in as many as 80% of children with the chromosomal disorder Down syndrome. It is not common to need a biopsy of a fissured tongue. If a fissured tongue causes any symptoms, your dentist may encourage you to brush your tongue. This may help remove debris that has built up in deep fissures, causing irritation. In almost all cases, though, no treatment is needed. However, if you have symptoms or any complications of Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome, your dentist or doctor may recommend that you see a specialist.""]"
26,Black Hairy Tongue,"[""The name black hairy tongue may sound scary, but the condition is harmless. Black hairy tongue is caused by bacteria or fungi in the mouth, which make the tongue appear black and hairy. It's easily remedied by good old-fashioned oral hygiene."", 'What Causes Black Hairy Tongue? A black hairy tongue is caused by too much bacteria or yeast growth in the mouth . The bacteria build up on tiny rounded projections called papillae. These lie along the surface of the tongue. Instead of shedding as they normally do, the papillae start to grow and lengthen, creating hair -like projections. They can grow to 15 times their normal length. Normally, the papillae are pinkish-white. But as they grow, pigments from food, drinks, and possibly the bacteria or yeast themselves get caught in the papillae, dyeing the tongue a color. Most often that color is black, hence the name. But the tongue can also turn brown, yellow, green, or a variety of other colors. Certain lifestyle habits and conditions can make people more likely to develop black hairy tongue. They include: poor oral hygiene smoking tobacco drinking a lot of coffee or tea using antibiotics (which may disrupt the normal balance of bacteria in the mouth ) being dehydrated taking medications that contain the chemical bismuth (such as Pepto-Bismol for upset stomach ) not producing enough saliva regularly using mouthwash that contains peroxide, witch hazel, or menthol getting radiation therapy to the head and neck Black hairy tongue is more common in men, people who use intravenous drugs, and those who are HIV-positive.', ""What Are the Symptoms of Black Hairy Tongue? Other than the appearance of the tongue, most people with black hairy tongue don't have any symptoms or feel any discomfort. The exception is when there is too much growth of the yeast Candida albicans , which can cause a burning sensation on the tongue. This burning sensation is called glossopyrosis. Some people complain of a tickling feeling in the back of the roof of the mouth, a metallic taste in their mouth, or nausea . In more severe cases, the condition may lead to a gagging feeling. Sometimes, food getting caught inside the extra-long papillae can cause bad breath ."", ""How Is Black Hairy Tongue Treated? Practicing good oral hygiene is the best way to treat black hairy tongue. Gently brush your teeth twice a day with a soft toothbrush . Also, brush your tongue. You can use a tongue scraper to make sure you're thoroughly cleaning the area. Drink plenty of water throughout the day to help keep your mouth clean."", ""Other tips include: If you smoke, quit. Add more roughage to your diet. Soft foods won't clean off the tongue effectively. Call your doctor or dentist if the problem doesn't get better on its own. Your doctor may prescribe antibiotics or an antifungal drug to get rid of the bacteria or yeast. Topical medications, such as tretinoin (Retin-A), are also sometimes prescribed. As a last resort, if the problem doesn't improve, the papillae can be surgically clipped off with a laser or electrosurgery.""]"
27,Tardive Dyskinesia,"[""Tardive dyskinesia is a side effect of antipsychotic medications . These drugs are used to treat schizophrenia and other mental health disorders. TD causes stiff, jerky movements of your face and body that you can't control. You might blink your eyes , stick out your tongue , or wave your arms without meaning to do so. Not everyone who takes an antipsychotic drug will get it. But if TD happens, it’s sometimes permanent. So if you have movements you can't control, let your doctor know right away. To ease your symptoms, your doctor may: Lower the dose Add another medication to counteract the movements Switch you to a different drug"", ""Symptoms Tardive dyskinesia causes stiff, jerky movements that you can't control. They include: Orofacial dyskinesia or oro-bucco-lingual dyskinesia : Uncontrolled movements in your face -- namely your lips, jaw, or tongue . You might: Stick out your tongue without trying Blink your eyes fast Chew Smack or pucker your lips Puff out your cheeks Frown Grunt Dyskinesia of the limbs: It can also affect your arms, legs, fingers, and toes. That can cause you to: Wiggle your fingers Tap your feet Flap your arms Thrust out your pelvis Sway from side to side These movements can be fast or slow. You may find it hard to work and stay active."", ""Causes and Risk Factors Antipsychotic meds treat schizophrenia , bipolar disorder , and other brain conditions. Doctors also call them neuroleptic drugs. They block a brain chemical called dopamine. It helps cells talk to each other and makes the muscles move smoothly. When you have too little of it, your movements can become jerky and out of control. You can get TD if you take an antipsychotic drug. Usually you have to be on it for 3 months or more. But there have been rare cases of it after a single dose of an antipsychotic medicine. Older versions of these drugs are more likely to cause this problem than newer ones. Some studies find a similar risk from both types, though. Antipsychotic medications that can cause tardive dyskinesia include antipsychotics like: Haloperidol (Haldol) Fluphenazine Risperidone (Risperdal) Olanzapine (Zyprexa) Your chances of getting TD go up the longer you take an antipsychotic medicine. Some drugs that treat nausea , reflux, and other stomach problems can also cause TD if you take them for more than 3 months. These include: Metoclopramide ( Reglan ) Prochlorperazine ( Compazine ) You're more likely to get it if you: Are a woman who has gone through menopause Are over age 55 Abuse alcohol or drugs Are African American or Asian American"", ""Diagnosis TD can be hard to diagnose. Symptoms might not appear until months or years after you start taking antipsychotic medicine. Or you might first notice the movements after you've already stopped taking the drug. The timing can make it hard to know whether the medicine caused your symptoms. Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS): If you take medicine for mental health conditions, your doctor should check you at least once a year to make sure you don't have TD. They can give you a physical exam called the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale, which will help them rate any abnormal movements. They can also do tests to find out whether you have another disorder that causes abnormal movements, like: Cerebral palsy Huntington's disease Parkinson's disease Stroke Tourette's syndrome To rule out these conditions, you may get: Blood tests Imaging scans of the brain, such as a CT or MRI scan"", 'Treatment and Prevention The goal is to prevent TD. When your doctor prescribes a new drug to treat a mental health disorder, ask about its side effects. The benefits of the drug should outweigh the risks.', ""If you have movement problems, tell your doctor but don't stop taking the drug on your own. Your doctor can take you off the medicine that caused the movements, or lower the dose. You might need to switch to a newer antipsychotic drug that may be less likely to cause TD. There are two FDA-approved medicines to treat tardive dyskinesia: Deutetrabenazine ( Austedo ) Valbenazine ( Ingrezza ) Both of these medicines work in similar ways to regulate the amount of dopamine flow in brain areas that control certain kinds of movements. Both can sometimes cause drowsiness. Austedo also has been shown to sometimes cause depression when used in patients with Huntington's disease. There's no proof that natural remedies can treat it, but some might help with movements: Ginkgo biloba Melatonin Vitamin B6 Vitamin E Talk to your doctor before you take any supplements for your symptoms.""]"
28,Acquired Lipodystrophy,"[""Lipodystrophy is a problem with the way your body uses and stores fat. It's called acquired when you aren't born with it. It often affects the fat that’s just under your skin, so it can change the way you look. It also can cause other changes in your body. Some people with HIV get lipodystrophy (LD-HIV). It may be related to the medicines they take or the disease itself. Other acquired lipodystrophies are: Acquired generalized lipodystrophy (AGL), or Lawrence syndrome Acquired partial lipodystrophy (APL), also called progressive lipodystrophy or Barraquer-Simons syndrome Localized lipodystrophy AGL often shows up in children, but adults can get it, too. APL typically starts around ages 8-10. Both conditions affect girls 3 times more often than boys. Both cause a person to lose fat from their face, so they may look sick or much older than they are. Localized lipodystrophy can happen to anyone at any age. A small dimple of localized lipodystrophy may look odd, but it probably won't cause any other trouble."", ""However, because fat tissue makes the hormone leptin , people with larger areas of acquired lipodystrophy might not have enough of this chemical in their bodies. Leptin tells your body you've eaten enough and to make insulin. Fat could also build up in places it shouldn't, like the blood, heart, liver, and kidneys. Depending on which type of lipodystrophy a person has, it may cause other problems, including diabetes , high cholesterol and triglycerides , liver disease, and kidney failure. Doctors can help you manage these complications. And cosmetic surgery might be an option if looks are a concern."", ""Causes Often, doctors don't know what causes acquired lipodystrophy, but some triggers are: An infection, such as measles , pneumonia, infectious mononucleosis, or hepatitis A disease where your immune system attacks your body (called an autoimmune disease ) Repeated injections in or pressure on the same place on your body An injury For example, people with diabetes who have to inject insulin daily tend to get localized lipodystrophy where they keep giving themselves shots. That's a good reason to change your injection site often."", ""Symptoms While all kinds of acquired lipodystrophy cause a loss of body fat, exactly what that means for each person is different. The type your child has will affect: Where it happens How much fat is lost Other effects on their body AGL . They'll lose fat from under the skin all over their body, including their face, arms, legs, palms, and sometimes the soles of their feet. They could look very muscular, and you’ll be able to see veins under their skin. Kids with AGL are very hungry all the time and grow fast. Adults may have large hands and feet and a strong, square jawbone if their hormone balance is off and they've kept growing. They could have larger than usual sex organs (clitoris and ovaries, penis and testicles). A woman might have irregular periods or none at all. They could have polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). They'll probably have extra hair on their upper lip and chin. Some people with AGL have patches of dark, velvety skin in their underarms, on their neck, around their belly button or nipples, or on their hands and feet."", 'Because of the fat loss, a person may have problems using sugar in their body or controlling their blood sugar and triglyceride levels. They could have a large liver or spleen. APL . This type affects just the upper body, on both sides. It usually starts with their face and moves to their neck, arms, and chest. Localized . This looks like a dent in the skin, but the skin itself seems fine. The size can vary. It could be in one spot or many. There might also be tender or painful bumps.', ""Getting a Diagnosis When you go to the doctor, they'll do a full exam and ask questions about your child’s health: What symptoms have you noticed? When did you first see them? Are changes in how they looks only in certain areas, or all over? Have they had panniculitis -- swollen bumps under their skin or a bumpy red rash? Do they have diabetes? What other health problems or recent injuries have they had? Have you had their blood sugar, cholesterol, and triglyceride levels checked?"", ""Tests of body fat can confirm the diagnosis. For a skin biopsy , the doctor will cut a small piece of skin and check the cells under a microscope. Your doctor may also look for a pattern of fat loss with: Skinfold thickness measurements, checking how much skin they can pinch between their fingers at specific spots on their body A special X-ray that measures bone mineral density A special whole-body MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) that uses powerful magnets and radio waves to make pictures showing tissues with fat Blood tests check: Blood sugar Kidney health Fats Liver enzymes Uric acid If the doctor suspects APL, they'll check their blood for evidence of a specific way the body attacks fat cells. Urine tests check for kidney problems."", 'Questions for Your Doctor What type of lipodystrophy is this? Do you know what caused it? Do we need any more tests? How many other people with this condition have you treated? What\'s the best way for us to treat it? What other symptoms should we watch for? Do we need to see any other doctors? Is there anything I can do that will help my child look and feel ""normal""? Can we be part of a lipodystrophy research trial?', ""Treatment Since you can't replace the missing body fat, your aim will be to avoid complications of the disease. A healthy lifestyle plays a big role. Everyone with lipodystrophy should eat a low-fat diet. But children still need enough calories and good nutrition so they grow properly. Exercise will help your child stay healthy, too. Physical activity lowers blood sugar and can keep fat from building up dangerously. People with AGL may be able to get metreleptin injections (Myalept) to replace the missing leptin and help prevent other diseases. Statins and omega-3 fatty acids, found in some fish, can help control high cholesterol or triglycerides, too. If your child has or gets diabetes, they'll need to take insulin or other drugs to control their blood sugar. Women with AGL shouldn't use oral birth control or hormone replacement therapy for menopause because they can make levels of certain fats worse."", ""Your doctor may prescribe a lotion or cream to lighten and soften dark skin patches. Over-the-counter bleaches and skin scrubs probably won't work and could irritate the skin. As your child gets older, they may be able to get plastic surgery to help fill out their face with skin grafts from their thighs, belly, or scalp. Doctors can also use implants and injections of fillers to help reshape facial features. People with APL who have extra fat deposits can use liposuction to get rid of some, but fat may build up again. Talk to your doctor about what approach for their appearance makes sense and when."", 'Taking Care of Your Child Because this condition affects how you look, care and compassion are as important as medicine. Focus on keeping your child healthy and being supportive. Set the tone for others. Be positive and open-minded. People may not know how to react or what to say to keep from prying, or offending or embarrassing you and your child. When someone asks about them, be matter-of-fact about their condition. Do what you can to boost their self-esteem. Try to focus your praise on achievements, rather than appearance. Encourage friendships. But kids will be kids, so prepare them for unkind looks and words. You can help them practice how they’ll react with role-play and humor. Consider professional counseling . Someone with training can help your child and your family sort out their feelings as they deal with the challenges of this disease.', 'What to Expect Over time, people with AGL can lose most or all of their body fat. With APL, it typically stops after a few years.', ""In general, the more fat you lose, the more serious the condition is. Yet many people with lipodystrophy live active, productive lives. You'll need to work closely with your doctor to prevent complications. For example, people with AGL are likely to have heart and liver problems. Diabetes can be hard to control. They might develop autoimmune disorders such as vitiligo (light-colored spots of skin), rheumatoid arthritis , and a kind of hepatitis."", ""People with APL probably won't have the insulin-related problems that often come with AGL. But it can lead to kidneys that don't work well or at all, and drusen, tiny fat deposits in the back of the eyes that may be connected to age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Women may get extra fat on their hips and thighs. AGL and APL can be linked to autoimmune disorders, too, including rheumatoid arthritis and celiac disease . Researchers are studying lipodystrophy, and they may find more ways to treat it."", ""Getting Support If you're looking for a community, Lipodystrophy United is a good place to start.

29,Lipoma,"['What Is a Lipoma? A lipoma is a lump of fat that grows in your body’s soft tissues. Though it’s classified as a tumor, it’s usually harmless. It’s the most common tumor to form beneath your skin. About 1 person out of every 1,000 will get one at some point. You most often find them in your upper body, arms, or thighs.', 'Symptoms of Lipoma They usually appear as small, soft lumps. They’re typically less than 2 inches wide. You could have more than one. When you press on the lipoma, it may feel doughy. It will move easily with finger pressure. They don’t normally hurt, but they can cause pain if they bump against nearby nerves or have blood vessels running through them.', 'Causes of Lipoma It isn’t clear what causes them. Middle-aged men and women tend to get them more. They also run in families. Lipomas often show up after an injury, though doctors don’t know whether that’s what makes them form. Inherited conditions can bring them on. Some people who have a rare condition known as Madelung’s disease can get them. This most often affects men of Mediterranean ancestry who have alcohol use disorder.', 'When to Call a Doctor If you notice a lump or swelling on your body, have a doctor check it out. They can let you know whether it’s a harmless lipoma or something that needs more tests. Lipomas can form inside muscles or internal organs, but this doesn’t happen often. If one is causing pain or affecting your muscles, you might have to get it removed. It’s rare, but a lump may be a type of cancer called a liposarcoma, which grows rapidly and can be painful. If your doctor suspects this condition, they’ll suggest more tests.', 'Lipoma Diagnosis Lipomas can usually be diagnosed with a physical exam. But you may need a biopsy, in which a small piece of the tissue is removed and looked at under a microscope, to confirm the diagnosis. Tests like X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs can also give a clearer picture.', 'Lipoma Removal and Treatment Since lipomas aren’t harmful, doctors often leave them alone. You may need to keep an eye on it between visits.', 'If one hurts or you don’t like the way it looks, you might want to have it removed. Your doctor can take it out surgically with a small cut. You’ll get a shot of medication to numb the area so it won’t hurt. You should be able to go home after it’s done. You may have to go back within a couple of weeks to get a few stitches taken out. Other possible treatments include: Steroids: This type of drug can help shrink a tumor. Liposuction : The doctor uses a needle and syringe to draw out the fatty tissue.', 'Large Lipomas Lipomas bigger than 2 inches are sometimes called giant lipomas. They can cause nerve pain , make you feel self-conscious about your looks, or change the way your clothes fit. It’s a little harder to take out one of these. The doctor will probably give you medication that will help you sleep through the procedure. You’ll need someone to drive you home afterward. Lipomas rarely come back once removed. Having one doesn’t make it more likely that you’ll get other diseases.']"
30,Liposarcoma,"[""What Is Liposarcoma? If you're diagnosed with liposarcoma, you have a form of cancer that starts in fat cells. It's a rare type of soft tissue sarcoma, cancers that start in soft tissues like muscle, nerves, tendon, or fat. There are five types of liposarcoma: Well-differentiated liposarcoma. It's the most common type, and it tends to grow slowly. It usually doesn't spread to other parts of your body. Myxoid liposarcoma. This is the second most common type. It can grow faster than well-differentiated tumors, and it's more likely to spread to other parts of your body. Its cells can form a unique shape or pattern. Round cell. This type can also grow faster than well-differentiated tumors and is often found in the arms or legs. Dedifferentiated liposarcoma. You have this type when a slow-growing tumor starts to change to a faster-growing, more aggressive type. Pleomorphic liposarcoma. It's a less-common form of the cancer and often spreads very quickly. Liposarcoma can happen at any age, but it's most common between ages 50 and 65."", ""Causes Doctors aren't sure exactly what causes liposarcoma. They do know these tumors form because of changes, called mutations, in the DNA of your fat cells. But it's not clear why that happens. A few things make you more likely to get liposarcoma: Some rare, genetic diseases Radiation treatments you've had in the past, usually for another cancer A family history of liposarcoma or other soft-tissue cancers"", 'Symptoms Liposarcoma can form in any part of your body that has fat cells. But it usually shows up in the fatty areas of the legs or belly. You may find that your tumor is not sore or painful at first. But it will continue to grow and will eventually cause problems or start to hurt. For example, if the liposarcoma tumor forms somewhere in your belly, it may push against your stomach or other organs. The symptoms of liposarcoma depend on where the tumor is on your body, but they include: A new or growing lump beneath your skin, especially around or behind your knees or on your thighs Pain or swelling Weakness in an arm or leg that has the lump Feeling full soon after you start eating Constipation Poop that has blood or looks black or tarry Cramping Bloody vomit Your belly gets larger', ""Getting a Diagnosis Your doctor will examine you and ask about your symptoms. If liposarcoma is a possibility, they'll likely order a test, such as: CT scan or MRI, which help your doctor see the size and scope of a tumor Biopsy, which involves removing a small piece of your tumor to test it for cancer cells"", 'Questions for Your Doctor Have you treated other people for this cancer? What is the stage of my cancer? What treatment do you recommend and why? What side effects might this treatment cause? Should I get a second opinion? What is my outlook? Where can I get support during treatment?', ""Treatment Your treatment options depend on where you have the tumor, how big it is, and the type. If possible, your doctor will try to remove the tumor with surgery. This is the most common treatment for liposarcoma. If your tumor is growing near an important organ, or if there's something else that prevents your doctor from removing all of the cancer during surgery, you may need to have radiation or chemotherapy after an operation to kill any cancer cells that may be left behind."", ""In some cases, your doctor may suggest radiation or chemo to shrink the size of the tumor before surgery. You can also ask your doctor about clinical trials for people with liposarcoma. These studies test new treatments to see if they're safe and if they work. Your doctor can let you know if you might be a good fit for one."", ""Taking Care of Yourself Liposarcoma and the treatments you get for it can have an impact on your body and your emotions. It's important to take care of both. If you find that liposarcoma is making you feel worried and stressed, talk to your doctor. They can suggest a therapist or mental health counselor who can help you manage your emotions. Also reach out to family and friends for the backing you need. Diet and exercise can help you feel better. Fresh vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and lean protein will help build back your strength. Stay active if you can. Exercise eases fatigue, boosts your mood, and improves your self-esteem. Some treatments, like chemotherapy and radiation, have side effects. Many of them will get better once your treatment ends."", ""What to Expect A team of doctors, nurses, and other health pros will manage your care. They'll let you know what treatment plan to follow, what side effects to expect, and how to manage any problems that come up.\xa0 Ask questions if anything isn't clear. Your doctor will tell you what to expect based on your type of liposarcoma, where it is in your body, and how healthy you are overall. After you finish treatment, you'll continue to see your doctor to make sure your cancer hasn't come back. These follow-ups will ensure that if your cancer does return, you can catch it early."", ""Getting Support No one knows what it's like to live with liposarcoma as well as someone who's had this cancer. That's where a support group can be a huge help. You'll meet other people who know just what you're going through. You may be able to tell your support group things you don't feel comfortable talking to friends and family about. The group members can give you guidance on everyday things like handling work or treatment side effects. You can find a support group through your hospital, an organization like the American Cancer Society, or online. Some support groups are for people with all types of cancer. Others focus only on sarcomas or liposarcoma.""]"
31,What Is Lissencephaly?,"['Lissencephaly is a rare condition that causes a child’s brain to develop the wrong way during pregnancy . A child with the disorder may have an unusual-looking face or a hard time swallowing, among the many health issues it can cause. How a child will get along with the condition varies. Some have near-normal development while others never go beyond a 5-month-old level. There’s no cure, but supportive care helps in some cases. It can be life-threatening for some kids, but other children grow into adulthood. Because there is such a wide range of complications, you should seek out a specialist in this condition.', 'Types During pregnancy, a baby’s brain should develop many folds and wrinkles as it grows. These folds allow the brain to function normally. In rare cases during the 9 th and 12 th weeks, this does not happen. The brain is mostly smooth and forms few wrinkles. Infants can have this condition by itself. You may hear a doctor call it “isolated lissencephaly sequence.” Other children can have it as a result of another condition. Some that might go along with it are: Miller-Dieker syndrome . Kids with this tend to have large foreheads, small jaws and other facial issues. They may grow more slowly and have breathing problems . Norman-Roberts syndrome. Complications can include wide-set eyes , seizures , and reduced mental abilities. Walker-Warburg syndrome . This causes severe muscle weakness and wasting.', 'Causes About 1 in every 100,000 babies is born with lissencephaly. Researchers have found that a problem in any one of several different genes can cause it. Most of these gene changes aren’t necessarily passed down from a parent. Instead, they can appear at random in a person’s genetic makeup when there is no family history of the condition. Some people with the condition don’t have changes in any of the genes that are known to be connected with it. They may have irregularities in genes that researchers have not yet identified, or their condition could have other unknown causes. Some research shows uterine infections during pregnancy could cause the condition. It may also be possible for a baby in the womb to have a stroke that leads to it.', 'Symptoms Lissencephaly has varying levels of severity and symptoms. The condition can stunt the growth of the brain. Infants may have an unusually small head at birth or sometime thereafter. Other possible signs and symptoms may include: Difficulty swallowing Muscle spasms Severe mental and physical challenges', 'Some kids may never be able to sit, stand, walk or roll over. They might have poor muscle tone. Their hands, fingers, or toes may be deformed. Other people, however, may develop normally and show few signs of a learning disability .', 'Seizures Infantile spasms, a type of seizure, are common in babies with lissencephaly. About 8 of 10 babies will have them. These seizures may be undetectable or not appear serious. They don’t cause the type of convulsions that people may imagine a seizure to be. If your baby has infantile spasms, it might look like they are startled or having colic or reflux. But they can be more serious than typical seizures. They can cause brain damage and further hinder your child’s growth. It’s important to seek medical attention right away. Some 9 out of 10 babies with lissencephaly will develop epilepsy , a type of brain disorder that also causes seizures, within the first year of life.', 'Diagnosis Doctors use brain scans to diagnose it. These may include a CT scan or MRI. After a doctor confirms a diagnosis, genetic testing might find a mutation that caused the condition.', 'Living With It There is no cure for lissencephaly, but some people can improve over time. Doctors and parents focus on controlling and addressing the symptoms. Physical, occupational, and speech therapy could help in some cases. People living with the condition might need medications to control seizures. Children can sit in wheelchairs or chairs that keep them upright. Some might need a feeding tube if they have trouble swallowing.', 'Complications Trouble with breathing and swallowing -- and seizures -- are common causes of death among people who have lissencephaly. Parents should remember every case is different. Although some children with the condition don’t live past age 10, others go on to become adults. You should seek out a specialist to give you more information about your child’s condition and support services.']"
32,What You Should Know About Food Poisoning,"['If you’ve ever had food poisoning, you probably had a good idea that’s what it was even before you talked to your doctor. It’s hard to miss the main symptoms: stomach cramps, vomiting , and diarrhea . They can hit a few hours or a day or two after you eat the food that caused the problem. Your symptoms usually pass in a few days or even in mere hours. But if your discomfort doesn’t go away, you may need to get checked and find out exactly what made you sick. You should also see a doctor if along with other symptoms you have high fever , blood in your stool, or feel dehydrated or unable to keep any food or liquid down. Your doctor may be able to tell you what caused it after running tests. But they\xa0aren’t always necessary and don’t confirm every case.', 'Do I Have Food Poisoning? Many times, your doctor will diagnose food poisoning based simply on your symptoms. While the main symptoms are nausea , diarrhea, vomiting, and stomach cramps, you also may have a fever, headache , muscle and joint aches, or blood in your stool. You may also be dehydrated, so your mouth and throat feel dry and you don’t pee as often as you typically do. Dehydration can make you dizzy when you stand up. Rarely, food poisoning can cause blurry or double vision , tingling, or weakness.', ""More than 250 bacteria, viruses, and parasites are known to cause food poisoning. They can exist in foods at any stage, such as when they're growing, packaged, shipped, stored, or cooked. Certain foods are more likely to harbor bad germs. These include raw eggs, unpasteurized milk and juice, soft cheeses, and raw or undercooked meat or seafood. Fresh produce is another risk. Foods made in bulk are problematic, too. A single bad egg could affect the whole batch of omelets in a buffet. You could make trouble for yourself by not washing the cutting board or your hands as you prepare different foods. Your chances of getting food poisoning are higher in the summer. In 90-degree heat, food can start to spoil within an hour. At a picnic or during a camping trip, you are more likely to eat undercooked grilled meats or to handle raw meat without access to soap and water. Bacteria can grow quickly inside tepid coolers. So if you're picnicking on a hot day, put leftovers back in with fresh ice."", ""Common Causes In 4 out of 5 cases of food poisoning, you never find out exactly what caused it. That's OK because you most likely will get better on your own. But in cases where the culprit is found, it's usually one of the following: Norovirus , often called stomach flu , is behind more than half of the foodborne illnesses in the U.S. where the cause is known. Norovirus can sicken you not only through eating contaminated foods, but also through touching doorknobs and other surfaces or having contact with an infected person. You should wipe down the kitchen if someone in your house has it. It typically takes 12-48 hours before you feel sick. Your symptoms may last 1-3 days. Salmonella is the name of a group of bacteria. They grow in undercooked eggs and meat. But you can also get salmonella from unpasteurized milk or cheese. Some fruits and vegetables, such as melons or sprouts, can also cause it. Symptoms start within 1-3 days and can last up to a week. Clostridium perfringens are bacteria that are more likely to show up when foods are prepared in bulk, such as in cafeterias or nursing homes or for catered events. Cooking kills the bacteria but not its spores. So food left warming can grow new germs. You can get it from beef, chicken, or gravy. You may have cramps and diarrhea but no other symptoms. You get sick within 6-24 hours and are usually feeling better in a couple of days. Campylobacter comes from undercooked poultry, unpasteurized milk, and sometimes water. It may take 2-5 days to develop symptoms you can notice. But you should feel better in another 2-10 days. You can't pass it to anyone. But if it's serious, you might have bloody diarrhea."", ""More Serious Causes Some bacteria cause fewer cases of food poisoning but can make you very sick. They can even cause death. They include: E. coli , a type of bacteria found in the intestines of animals. You can get this from undercooked ground beef, unpasteurized milk, sprouts, or any food or liquid that has had contact with animal feces or sewage. Some strains are harmless. Others can make you very sick. Listeria is an unusual bacteria that can grow in cold temperatures such as in the refrigerator. It's found in smoked fish, raw (unpasteurized) cheeses, ice cream, pates, hot dogs, and deli meats. Typically, symptoms start within 24 hours of eating the product and you have short-lived gastroenteritis with watery diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and sometimes fever. That said, it can be much more serious in older people, pregnant women, or those with weakened immune systems. The bacteria can enter the bloodstream and central nervous system and cause an infection called listeriosis. This usually happens within 10 days to a month after exposure. In addition to diarrhea and vomiting, listeria can cause unusual symptoms, including weakness, confusion, and a stiff neck. It can also be deadly. If you have any of these symptoms, call your doctor right away."", ""Tests for Food Poisoning If your illness is severe or complicated, your doctor may run some of the following tests. Stool cultures are the most common lab test for food poisoning . Your doctor may order one if you have a fever, ntense stomach pain ,\xa0or bloody diarrhea, or if there is an outbreak that is being tracked. They may also order one if you have symptoms that linger. A sample of your stool can help tell if your sickness is related to bacteria. It can even reveal the germ’s DNA “fingerprint” and which antibiotics will kill it. Viruses are more difficult to see in culture,\xa0 so if the specific virus needs to be identified, your doctor\xa0may order stool tests to look for\xa0the germ's DNA fingerprint.Microscopic exams of stool can identify parasites. Stool tests aren’t always accurate, and they can take several days to come back. Blood tests may be ordered if your doctor thinks the infection has spread into the blood. Blood tests can detect the bacteria Listeria monocytogenes and the hepatitis A virus. Specific blood tests can tell how sick you are by looking for inflammation and signs that you’re dehydrated."", 'Stool or blood tests can check for toxins, such as for botulism, which can be deadly. Imaging tests such as MRIs and CT scans aren’t often used in food poisoning cases. But they can help rule out other causes for your symptoms.', 'Could It Be Something Else? A host of other conditions can lead to many of the same symptoms of food poisoning . Most common is mon-foodborne gastroenteritis ,\xa0which is most often caused by a virus. For instance, Norovirus causes both foodborne gastroenteritis (from contaminated\xa0food or water) and viral gastroenteritis from person to person spread.\xa0Other causes include gallbladder problems , pancreatitis , and inflammatory bowel disease . So figuring out if you have food poisoning is as much about the timing as it is about the symptoms themselves.', ""Delayed Symptoms In most cases, food poisoning usually shows up hours or days after you’ve eaten something that made you sick.\xa0 That can make it hard to know if it's food poisoning or something else. The delay also makes it tricky to trace the illness back to the specific food or drink."", 'But different organisms work at different speeds. For example, Staphylococcus aureus can give you cramps, diarrhea, and nausea in as little as 30 minutes after you eat or drink. This bacterium grows in meats, eggs , and cream that haven’t been refrigerated properly. Another, far less common, cause of foodborne illness is the hepatitis A virus. It can lie in wait as long as 50 days before making itself known. You can get the virus through foods and drinks that have been in contact with sewage water. You’re more likely to get the virus when traveling in developing countries.', 'Food Poisoning Treatment Call 911 if you think the food poisoning may be from seafood or wild mushrooms, or if the person is severely dehydrated. First, control n ausea and vomiting : Avoid solid foods until vomiting ends. Then eat light, bland foods, such as saltine crackers, bananas, rice, or bread. Sipping liquids may help avoid vomiting. Don’t eat fried, greasy, spicy, or sweet foods. Don’t take anti-nausea or anti- diarrhea medication without asking your doctor. They have side effects and may make some kinds of diarrhea worse. Your doctor may give you anti-nausea medication if you are at risk of being dehydrated.', 'It’s important to prevent dehydration : Drink clear fluids, starting with small sips and gradually drinking more. If vomiting and diarrhea last more than 24 hours, drink an oral rehydration solution. Call a doctor right away if symptoms last more than 3 days or you have: Severe belly pain Fever Bloody diarrhea or dark stools Vomiting that is prolonged or bloody Signs of dehydration , such as dry mouth , decreased urination, dizziness , fatigue , or increased heart rate or breathing rate', 'Food Poisoning Prevention Food safety for high-risk groups Food poisoning is more common and riskier for people with weakened immune systems, infants and young children, pregnant women, and the elderly. If you fall into one of these groups, try to avoid: Sushi and other raw seafoods and partly cooked shellfish like mussels, clams, and scallops. Refrigerated smoked seafood. These usually have labels that say “Nova-style,” “lox,” “kippered,” “jerky,” or “smoked.” Smoked seafood should be safe if you cook it well or if it has been canned or stored on a shelf. Unpasteurized juice and cider, including fresh-squeezed. These drinks can be safe if you boil them for 1 minute. Soft cheeses (Brie and Camembert), blue-veined cheeses (Roquefort) and Mexican-style cheeses (queso blanco, queso fresco, Panela). These are often made from unpasteurized milk, especially when they’re sold at farmer’s markets. Feta is also often made with raw milk. Stick with hard cheeses like cheddar or Swiss. Raw or partly cooked eggs. That means staying away from cookie and cake batter (not even a lick of the spoon). Same for homemade eggnog, tiramisu, Caesar dressing, hollandaise sauce, and ice cream . If you buy one of these products at the store, check the label to make sure it doesn’t contain raw eggs. At home, cook eggs until the yolk is hard. Raw or undercooked sprouts such as alfalfa, clover, mung beans, and radishes. Premade salads from the deli that contain meat or seafood. Canned versions are safe. Pâtés or meat spreads that have been refrigerated (they may be unpasteurized). Hot dogs, cold cuts, and luncheon and deli meats, even if they’re labeled cooked. Eat them only after you’ve reheated them steaming hot. Make sure no juices from these products end up on your hands or on plates, utensils, or counters.', 'Food safety in the grocery store Before you load items into the shopping cart: Check the ingredients for unpasteurized milk or raw eggs. Make sure the “sell by” date hasn’t passed. Don’t buy food in dented or bulging cans or in damaged packaging. Pick up meat, poultry, and seafood just before you check out to limit the time they go unrefrigerated. Wrap meats in separate plastic bags so they don’t touch other items. Go directly home after you buy your food, and put away refrigerated items right away. Food safety in the kitchen These tips will help make your home-cooked meals safe: Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Also wash hands during cooking and preparations if you switch from one food to another. Keep countertops clean. Rinse all fruits and vegetables , even if you’re not going to eat the skin. Don’t let raw meat, poultry, seafood, and eggs come into contact with other foods on cutting boards, countertops, utensils, and other surfaces. Don’t touch any foods if you have symptoms of food poisoning . Wash cutting boards and knives with antibacterial soap and warm to hot water after handling raw meat, poultry, seafood, or eggs. Wooden cutting boards are not recommended because they can be harder to clean. Do not thaw foods at room temperature. Thaw foods in the refrigerator, and use them promptly. Do not refreeze foods if they have been thawed all the way. Don’t set out eggs, meats, poultry, seafood, or milk at room temperature for long. Cooking kills bacteria. Use a thermometer to make sure meats are cooked to safe temperatures. For beef and pork, it’s 145 F. For poultry, it’s 165 F. Keep your fridge temperature below 40 F and your freezer at 0 F.', 'Food safety while eating out You have more control over the safety of\xa0 foods cooked at home than in a restaurant. But you can still take some safe steps when eating out: Choose where you eat carefully. If the restaurant looks dirty to you, it could be a sign that it isn’t handling or serving food properly. People who eat often at fast-food restaurants are more likely to report stomach issues than those who don’t visit as often. Check with your local health department’s restaurant inspection reports. Some states and cities require restaurants to post their health ratings in a visible spot. Always ask for your hamburger or other ground meat well done. For whole steak, roast, or a chop, medium rare (145 F) can be safe. Raw-meat dishes like steak tartare are risky. Make sure there are no raw or undercooked eggs in anything you order. If you take home food, put it in the fridge within 2 hours of leaving the restaurant. If it’s above 90 F outside, make that 1 hour.', ""Food safety while traveling Who doesn’t love a vacation? But you need to be careful when you travel, especially to developing countries. Eat packaged or dry foods. Many of the bugs that cause food poisoning prefer moisture. Dry foods such as bread or chips or factory-sealed foods such as tuna are usually a safe bet. Go for bottled, canned, or hot drinks. Carbonated drinks are a good choice, because the bubbles will tell you it’s been sealed properly. You should be good with coffee or tea if it arrives steaming hot. Avoid raw food, local wild game, and tap water and ice in developing countries. Other safety tips Breastfeed your baby if possible. Mother's milk is the safest food for young infants. Breastfeeding may prevent many foodborne illnesses and other health problems. Wash your hands with soap after handling reptiles, turtles, birds, or after contact with human or pet feces. If you have diarrhea or vomiting , do not prepare food for others, especially people in high-risk groups. Always wash your hands before preparing food or eating. Always wash your hands after using the toilet, changing diapers , or coughing or sneezing .""]"
33,What Is Listeria?,"['It can happen to anybody -- you eat something and it doesn’t agree with you. You feel sick to your stomach , and you might come down with diarrhea . After a couple of days (or less in most cases), the trouble goes away and that’s the end of it. A possible source of the illness: listeria , one of the causes of food poisoning . It’s triggered by listeria bacteria that can live in soil, water , dust, animal poop , and other substances. You can get sick if you eat food that carries it. For most healthy people, the infection doesn’t pose much of a threat, even if it makes you sick for a day or two.\xa0Healthy people rarely become ill from listeria infection, but for some people, the infection can be serious or even life-threatening, particularly pregnant women and their babies, people whose immune systems aren’t working right, and seniors. If you belong to any of those groups, you need to be extra cautious.\xa0Prompt antibiotic treatment can help curb the effects of listeria infection.', 'What Causes Listeria? Listeria is caused by bacteria that can grow at cold temperatures, like those inside a refrigerator. Even freezing doesn’t stop it. When it contaminates food, you can’t see, smell, or taste it. People pick up the infection most often from deli meats that aren’t processed properly or from dairy products made from milk that isn’t pasteurized -- in other words, the milk hasn’t been heated to kill germs. Other common sources of outbreaks are: Cantaloupes Hot dogs Soft cheeses', 'Symptoms When you get a listeria infection, the signs typically include: Diarrhea Nausea Achy muscles Fever They could appear a few days after you eat the bad food, or they might take a couple of months to show up. If you have any of those symptoms, contact your doctor. If the infection spreads to your nervous system, it’s more serious. This severe form, called listeriosis, is fatal for 20% of people who have it. This happens most often with the very young, the very old, and people with weakened immune systems. The signs could be: Headache Stiff neck Confusion Loss of balance Convulsions', 'Go for emergency care or call 911 if you or a loved one have any of these symptoms. When you’re pregnant, you need to take special care because you have an increased risk of listeria in the blood . Call your doctor if you have: Headache Fever Achy muscles Back pain with or without diarrhea A mild case of listeria may need no treatment at all. For a more serious case, the doctor may use antibiotics .', 'Foods to Watch Out For There’s no vaccine to protect against listeria. So it’s important to be on guard. The main foods that can make you sick include: Raw vegetables contaminated by soil or by manure that was used as fertilizer Animal meat that is contaminated with listeria Milk that wasn’t pasteurized , and other products made from it Processed foods such as deli meats and hot dogs that are contaminated after they’re produced', 'How to Protect Yourself Be sure to wash your hands . Clean them well with warm, soapy water before you start cooking. If you handle raw meat or poultry, wash them afterward. Here are some other good ideas for cleaning, handling, and cooking food: Clean all kitchen surfaces, cutting boards, and utensils with hot, soapy water when you finish cooking. Scrub raw vegetables with a brush under running water. Cook meat, poultry, and egg dishes until they reach 160 F in the center. Use a meat thermometer to make sure. Keep uncooked meat and poultry away from other food. Use hot dogs within a week after you open the package, and deli and luncheon meats within 3 to 5 days after opening. Wash your hands with soap before handling a whole melon . Clean it with a brush under running water. Eat slices promptly. Throw out anything that sits at room temperature more than 4 hours. Keep the temperature below 40 F in the refrigerator , and below 0 F in the freezer .', 'People Who Should Be Extra Careful Pregnant women, and especially pregnant Hispanic women, are more likely than most people to come down with listeriosis.\xa0An infection, even one that affects the mother mildly, can have very serious effects on the baby , including premature birth or even stillbirth.', 'If a baby is born with listeria, symptoms might include: Little interest in feeding Fussiness Fever Vomiting Pregnant women and people in the other at-risk groups -- seniors and people whose immune systems are weak -- need to be especially careful. They should not eat: Hot dogs, cold cuts, or deli meats unless they have been heated to 165 F Refrigerated meat spreads or refrigerated smoked seafood. Foods that do not need refrigeration, such as canned tuna, are OK. Soft cheeses that are made from milk that has not been pasteurized. Some examples: brie, camembert, feta, queso panela, queso blanco and queso fresco. But if the label says specifically that the cheese is made from pasteurized milk, it’s OK.', 'Recalled Foods Just as cars might be recalled by their makers because of safety defects, companies that make and sell food sometimes have to recall it. News media report these recalls when they happen, and the federal foodsafety.gov website lists recalls on its home page. If you see a recall for food that you’ve eaten, watch for symptoms of listeria, and contact your doctor if you have any.']"
34,Understanding Liver Cancer -- the Basics,"['What Is Liver Cancer? The liver continuously filters blood that circulates through the body, converting nutrients and drugs absorbed from the digestive tract into ready-to-use chemicals. The liver performs many other important functions, such as removing toxins and other chemical waste products from the blood and readying them for excretion. The liver can be affected by primary liver cancer , which arises in the liver, or by cancer which forms in other parts of the body and then spreads to the liver. Most liver cancer is secondary or metastatic, meaning it started elsewhere in the body. Primary liver cancer, which starts in the liver, accounts for about 2% of cancers in the U.S., but up to half of all cancers in some undeveloped countries. This is mainly due to the prevalence of hepatitis, caused by contagious viruses, that predisposes a person to liver cancer. In the U.S., primary liver cancer strikes twice as many men as women, at an average age of 67. Because the liver is made up of several different types of cells, several types of tumors can form there. Some of these are benign (noncancerous), and some are cancerous and can spread to other parts of the body (metastasize). These tumors have different causes and are treated differently. The outlook for health or recovery depends on what type of tumor you have.', ""The more common benign tumors of the liver include: Hemangioma Hepatic adenoma Focal nodular hyperplasia Cysts Lipoma Fibroma Leiomyoma None of these tumors are treated like liver cancer . They may need to be removed surgically if they cause pain or bleeding. Liver cancers include: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) Cholangiocarcinoma (These are really cancers of the bile duct. They will not be discussed in this article.) This article discusses hepatocellular carcinoma. It's important to know what type of liver tumor you have. Be sure to get that information from your healthcare provider."", 'What Causes Liver Cancer? Primary liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma) tends to occur in livers damaged by alcohol misuse, or chronic infection with diseases such as hepatitis B and C, hemochromatosis (a hereditary disease associated with too much iron in the liver), and cirrhosis . More than half of all people diagnosed with primary liver cancer have cirrhosis -- a scarring condition of the liver commonly caused by alcohol misuse. Hepatitis B and C and hemochromatosis can cause permanent damage and liver failure . Liver cancer may also be linked to obesity and fatty liver disease .', ""Various cancer-causing substances are associated with primary liver cancer, including certain herbicides and chemicals such as vinyl chloride and arsenic. Smoking, especially if you abuse alcohol as well, also increases risk. Aflatoxins, cancer-causing substances made by a type of plant mold , have also been implicated. Aflatoxins can contaminate wheat, peanuts, rice, corn, and soybeans. These are rare problems in most developed countries like the U.S. Other causes include the hormones androgen and estrogen and a dye formerly used in medical tests called thorotrast. Other risk factors for liver cancer may include: Your sex . Men are more likely to get hepatocellular carcinoma than women. Your weight . Obesity can increase the risk for hepatocellular carcinoma . Your race. In the U.S., liver cancer is most common in Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. Anabolic steroid use. Male hormones abused by athletes to increase muscle can slightly increase liver cancer risk with long-term use. History of diabetes . Studies have suggested a link between diabetes and liver cancer. This is likely due to the link between diabetes and fatty liver disease. Inherited metabolic diseases. Diseases that disrupt the normal metabolism of the body have been shown to increase your risk of liver cancer. Rare diseases. Studies have found a link between liver cancer and some rare diseases like alpha -1- antitrypsin deficiency , tyrosinemia, and Wilson's disease.""]"
35,Understanding Liver Cancer -- Diagnosis and Treatment,"[""How Do I Know If I Have Liver Cancer? Screening for early detection of primary liver cancer is not performed routinely, but it may be considered for people at high risk for the disease. However, studies haven't determined if screening is beneficial for people who are not at increased risk. To diagnose liver cancer , a doctor must rule out other causes of liver dysfunction. Patients at high risk include patients with a condition called hemochromatosis, chronic hepatitis, and alcoholics. Additional tests include: Blood tests that measure tumor markers -- the levels of these substances rise in the blood if someone has a particular cancer -- can aid diagnosis. Liver cancers secrete a substance called alpha fetoprotein (AFP) that is normally present in fetuses but goes away at birth. An elevated AFP in adults may indicate liver cancer as it is produced in 70% of liver cancers. Elevated levels of iron may also be a tumor marker. Imaging with ultrasound is the initial diagnostic test as it can detect tumors as small as one centimeter. High resolution CT scans and contrast MRI scans are used to diagnose and stage these tumors. A liver biopsy will distinguish a benign tumor from a malignant one. However, depending on the results of other tests, a biopsy might not be required to diagnose cancer . Laparoscopy, using tools and cameras through small incisions, is useful for detecting small tumors, determining the extent of cirrhosis , or obtaining a biopsy, and confirm previous tests, among other things."", ""What Are the Treatments for Liver Cancer? Any liver cancer is difficult to cure. Primary liver cancer is rarely detectable early, when it is most treatable. Secondary or metastatic liver cancer is hard to treat because it has already spread. The liver's complex network of blood vessels and bile ducts makes surgery difficult. Most treatment concentrates on making patients feel better and perhaps live longer . Patients with early-stage tumors that can be removed surgically have the best chance of long-term survival. Unfortunately, most liver cancers are inoperable at the time it's diagnosed, either because the cancer is too advanced or the liver is too diseased to permit surgery. In some patients, chemotherapy is given directly into the liver (chemoembolization) to reduce tumors to a size that may make surgery possible. This may also be done without chemotherapy (bland embolization) in some cases, using ethanol instead. Patients in remission must be monitored closely for potential recurrence."", ""Cryotherapy, or freezing the tumor, and radiofrequency ablation (RFA), using radio waves to destroy the tumor, may be used to treat some cases of liver cancer. Radiation therapy can be given in various ways, but has its limitations due to the liver's low tolerance to radiation. When used, the role of radiation is to alleviate symptoms outside of the liver or to relieve pain within the liver by shrinking the tumor. Radioembolization therapy uses substances to cut off the blood supply to the tumor."", ""A liver transplant may be an option for those with both liver cancer and cirrhosis. Although this procedure is risky, it offers some chance of long-term survival. Advanced liver cancer has no standard curative treatment. Chemotherapy and low-dose radiation may control the cancer's spread and ease pain, however these are of modest benefit in this type of cancer. Most patients receive painkilling medication along with drugs to relieve nausea , improve appetite, and reduce abdominal or lower body swelling. The drug sorafenib ( Nexavar ) and regorafenib ( Stivarga ) are targeted drugs that can improve the overall survival with advanced liver cancer. In addition, lenvatinib ( Lenvima ), nivolumab ( Opdivo ),\xa0and the combination of atezolizumab ( Tecentriq ) plus bevacizumab ( Avastin , Mvasi , Zirabevcan ) can also be used to treat advanced liver cancer. People with advanced liver cancer may choose to join clinical trials testing new approaches to treatment.""]"
36,What Is Epidermolysis Bullosa?,"['Epidermolysis bullosa is a rare genetic condition that makes skin so fragile that it can tear or blister at the slightest touch. Children born with it are often called “Butterfly Children” because their skin seems as fragile as a butterfly wing. Mild forms may get better with time. But severe cases can be painful, trigger other serious health issues, and can be life-threatening. If you have this condition, you need special treatment to keep your delicate skin as healthy as possible.', 'Types There are five major types of epidermolysis bullosa. The kind you have depends on where your blisters tend to form. Epidermolysis Bullosa Simplex: The most common type, it first shows up in newborns. It mainly affects the palms of the hands and soles of the feet . Junctional epidermolysis bullosa : While it also first appears in babies, this is a more severe form that causes blistering in deep layers of the skin. Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa: If you have this type, your skin doesn’t have collagen to hold it together, or the collagen you do have doesn’t work well. This means the layers of your skin don’t seal together like they should. Sometimes this type doesn’t show up until early childhood.', 'Kindler syndrome: This is a mixed condition since blisters appear across different skin layers. It can also cause patchy changes in your skin coloring when it’s exposed to the sun. Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita: This form causes blisters on your hands and feet as well as in mucous membranes like the mouth .', 'Causes Almost all types of epidermolysis bullosa run in families. If you inherited certain gene glitches from your parents, you will have it. There’s one exception. Epidermolysis bullosa aquisita is the only type that’s not inherited. It happens because of a problem in your immune system .', 'Symptoms Usually, signs of epidermolysis bullosa first appear in babies or toddlers . Painful skin blisters are the main symptom. They can form anywhere on the skin. Sometimes they also form on the eyes , or in parts of the throat, stomach , or bladder . If these blisters become infected or scar the skin, they cause more problems.', 'Diagnosis To confirm the condition, your doctor may take a small sample of skin and send it to a lab where experts will use a microscope to look at it.', 'Treatment There’s no cure for epidermolysis bullosa. But there are treatments for it. If you have a severe case, you’ll care for your skin much like someone who has a burn does. You’ll need to learn how to perform daily wound treatment and how to bandage and protect affected areas. Your doctor can also prescribe a medicine to help with pain relief. In some cases, you might need surgery. If you have blisters that have fused your fingers and toes together, your doctor can separate them. Or if your esophagus , the tube connecting your mouth to your stomach , becomes too scarred, you can get surgery to widen it to help you eat. Some people with epidermolysis bullosa still find eating too painful. In that case, your doctor may suggest a feeding tube so food goes right into your stomach.', 'Tips for At-Home Care To help prevent blisters, you have to take special care of your skin. Reduce friction. Use lotion to keep your skin moist and reduce friction. If you cover wounds, use only dressings that aren’t sticky, then loosely wrap again with rolled gauze. Wear loose-fitting clothes without tags, tight sleeves, or seams.', 'Drain blisters. If left untreated, these can fill with fluid and become infected. Your doctor can show you the best way to drain them. Keep cool. Keep your bath water no warmer than room temperature. Stay in air conditioning as much as you can and avoid heat and humidity. Know the signs of infection. Your skin may get red or feel hot to the touch if it is becoming infected. You could also notice pus or a yellow discharge crusting at the site, a red streak under the skin, or have fever or chills. If you see any of these signs, call your doctor right away. You may need antibiotics . Check your diet . Many people with epidermolysis bullosa have low levels of iron, selenium , or vitamin D . Your doctor may suggest that you see a nutritionist about eating more foods that are rich in these vitamins and minerals.', 'Get support. Talk to your doctor or someone you trust. You might also find it helpful to talk about your feelings to a therapist or at a support group in your area.']"
37,Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS),"[""What Is ALS? ALS is a disease that causes motor neurons, the nerve cells that send messages from your brain to your spinal cord and then to your muscles, to break down and die. These motor neurons control all your voluntary movements, allowing you to do things like walk, chew and swallow food, and even breathe. There are two main types of these nerve cells. Upper motor neurons are located in the brain. They send signals down the spinal cord to the lower motor neurons, which stimulate the muscles to move. With ALS, your brain can't send messages to your muscles anymore. Because the muscles don't get any signals, they become very weak and waste away. This is called atrophy. ALS is a progressive disease, which means it gets worse over time. As your muscles atrophy, it gets harder for you to walk, talk, eat, and breathe. There are two types of ALS: Sporadic ALS is the most common form. It affects up to 95% of people with the disease. Sporadic means it happens sometimes without a clear cause. Familial ALS (FALS) runs in families. About 5% to 10% of people with ALS have this type. FALS is caused by changes to a gene. Parents pass the faulty gene to their children. If one parent has the gene for ALS, each of their children will have a 50% chance of getting the gene and having the disease."", ""What Causes ALS? Researchers still don't know exactly what causes ALS. Gene changes, or mutations, are behind 5% to 10% of cases. More than 12 different mutations have been linked to the disease. One mutation is to a gene that makes a protein called SOD1. This protein may be toxic to motor neurons. Other gene changes in ALS might also damage motor neurons. Your environment could also play a role in ALS. Scientists are studying whether people who come into contact with certain chemicals or germs are more likely to get the disease. Scientists are also looking at these other possible causes: Glutamate. This chemical is a type of neurotransmitter – it sends signals to and from the brain and nerves. With ALS, glutamate builds up in the spaces around nerve cells and may damage them."", 'The medication riluzole (Rilutek) works by lowering glutamate levels and can help make the disease progress more slowly. Immune system problems. Your immune system protects your body from foreign invaders such as bacteria and viruses. Microglia are the main type of immune cell in your brain. They destroy germs and damaged cells. With ALS, microglia might also destroy healthy motor neurons.', 'Mitochondria problems. Mitochondria are the parts of your cells where energy is made. A problem with them might lead to ALS or make an existing case worse. Oxidative stress. Your cells use oxygen to make energy. Your body may form some of this oxygen into toxic substances called free radicals, which can damage cells. The medication edaravone (Radicava) is an antioxidant that can help control these free radicals.', 'Symptoms ALS affects everyone differently, but it causes a gradual loss of control in your voluntary muscles -- the ones you use to walk, talk, move, speak, eat, drink, and breathe. Early symptoms of ALS may include: Muscle twitching in the arm, leg, shoulder, or tongue Muscle cramps, especially in your hands and feet Muscle tightness or stiffness Weakness in your hands, arm, leg, or only one side of the body Trouble speaking loudly Slurred speech Problems chewing or swallowing Later on, ALS can cause you to: Trip or fall more often Drop things a lot Lose weight Drool or choke on liquid Feel tired all the time Have trouble controlling facial expressions Laugh or cry without meaning to', 'As the disease progresses, it affects more of your body. Eventually, you may not be able to control your muscles and do things on your own, including: Move your arms and legs Stand or walk Get in and out of bed Chew or swallow Talk or form words Breathe without help from a machine Less commonly, you may notice changes in your memory or how you think and act.', 'Diagnosis and Testing There isn’t one test used to diagnose ALS. Your doctor will give you a physical exam and ask about your medical history. You’ll also get a neurologic exam to check how well your muscles and nerves work together. These tests measure your reflexes and check for muscle problems like weakness, wasting, or spasticity (stiffness). Symptoms of ALS can mimic other medical problems. You’ll likely need several tests to rule out other health conditions and confirm an ALS diagnosis. The most common ones are: Electromyogram (EMG). Your doctor will poke a needle through your skin into your muscle to measure electrical activity. If you have ALS, your muscle fibers won’t fire as they should. Nerve conduction study. This test checks for communication problems between your nerves and muscles. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Your doctor will take detailed images of your brain and spinal cord to check for tumors or other things that might cause your symptoms. Blood and urine tests. These can help your doctor rule out other health conditions. Spinal tap. This is also called a lumbar puncture. Your doctor may put a hollow needle in your lower back to take a sample of your spinal fluid. Muscle biopsy. Your doctor may remove a small part of your muscle so they can look at it under a microscope. They’ll give you numbing medicine first, so it doesn’t hurt. You may be more likely to get this test if there’s a chance you have another muscle disease besides ALS.', ""My Diagnosis Story By Fred Shank, as told to Kara Mayer Robinson I was diagnosed with ALS last year. The symptom that brought me to a doctor was a drop left foot. But looking back, there were other signs. The earliest sign was struggling to keep flip-flops on my feet when I walked on a boardwalk after years of wearing them. I remember my toes couldn't grasp the soles easily and they’d slide or slip off. Later, even though I was very active and in good shape -- I work out regularly, I play tennis twice a week, and I’m a Peloton enthusiast -- I remember not being able to fire up my legs and accelerate to reach a jump shot in tennis. At the time I chalked it up to getting older or being tired. When I noticed the drop foot, I went to a sports medicine doctor, who suggested an MRI and X-rays. His initial concern was a herniated disk in my back, which we found by doing an EMG on my left leg. It showed the disk was disrupting my nerves."", ""He recommended spinal surgery; either full fusion or microfusion. But as I was deciding which one to have, my right leg started to show symptoms. We thought the herniated disk was now affecting both legs, so we went with full fusion spinal surgery. Two months later, I wasn't bouncing back stronger and my nerves weren’t improving. I went to a neurologist, who recommended another EMG. I remember watching her face when she did the test on my legs and lower back. Things were off. She needed to do more tests on my upper body and neck and asked me to come back at her next available time, which was nearly a month later. She also diagnosed motor neuron disease (MND) with the possibility of ALS. She had me take the genetic test for ALS and told me about her hospital network’s ALS clinic. I decided to get a second opinion at the ALS Clinic at Johns Hopkins. They got copies of my test, ran a full blood screen, and did a clinical exam. They said it was probable I had ALS and recommended starting treatment immediately. ALS apparently needs months to officially be diagnosed, but they didn't see a reason to wait, so I went with the Johns Hopkins team."", ""Doctors have to rule out nearly every other thing to arrive at ALS. There’s a genetic test, but it only identifies about 10% of the cases. It's a long road, not only because how the disease works but because of our health care system. There aren't neurologists on every street corner who have experience with MND or ALS. Finding someone with that insight and getting an appointment takes time, which can be terribly frustrating. If you’re on this road, my advice is to be kind to yourself. It's a lot to deal with. No emotion is wrong."", 'Questions for Your Doctor There’s a lot to know about ALS, and it may take more than one appointment for you to absorb all the information. Write down the topics you’d like to go over and bring the list with you. It’s easy to forget things when face-to-face with your medical team. Here are some questions to get you started: What are the symptoms of ALS? What kind of ALS do I have? How do you know my symptoms are from ALS? Can you go over all my test results with me? What are all my treatment options? How can occupational, speech, and respiratory therapy help? Is there a cure for ALS? Does ALS cause pain?', 'You may also want to ask: Can I catch germs and get sick easier? Does ALS increase my chances of other health problems? What kind of exercise is best for someone with ALS? Do I need to change my diet? How fast will I lose muscle strength? Is there anything I can do to slow the progression of ALS? When should I get home health care services? How can I join a clinical trial? When it comes to financial support, ask your doctor if you can talk to a social worker or navigator for advice. Some questions to ask are: How can I get help paying for my medical care? What does insurance cover? How can I apply for Medicare or Medicaid? How do I apply for disability or Social Security benefits? Do veterans get extra benefits? If so, how do I find out what they are and how to get them?', 'Your Treatment Plan Medication and other therapies can make daily life better and more comfortable, but there’s no way to reverse damage caused by ALS or to cure the disease.', 'Treatment for ALS may include: Medication. These are prescription drugs that may help you live longer or improve your quality of life. Medications approved to treat ALS include: Riluzole. (Exservan, Rilutek, Tiglutik kit). You take this drug by mouth, either as a liquid or a tablet that dissolves under your tongue. It may help you live 3 to 6 months longer. Edaravone (Radicava). You get this drug through a vein in your arm or as a pill. It may help you function a little better day to day, but scientists don’t know if it can help you live longer. Sodium phenylbutyrate and taurursodiol (Relyvrio). This drug comes in powder form. You can mix it with water or put it in a feeding tube. It may help slow disease progression, but we need more research to show how well it works for large groups of people with ALS. Drugs to ease symptoms. Your doctor may also give you medicine to manage problems related to ALS, including: Muscle cramps or spasms Constipation Fatigue Making extra spit or mucus Pain Depression Trouble sleeping', 'You can also take medicine to manage pseudobulbar affect (PBA). PBA is the medical name for sudden episodes of crying or laughing that happen at the wrong time. Your doctor can let you know if PBA treatment is right for you. Other therapies. There are many things you can do to feel better with ALS. You’ll need to work with a team of health professionals to get the most benefit.', 'Your Care Team Along with a regular doctor, you may see: A neurologist to prescribe ALS treatment. A dietitian to help you get good nutrition with easy-to-swallow foods or through a feeding tube. An occupational therapist to teach you about techniques and tools to stay independent. A physical therapist to help ease pain and keep you moving for as long as possible. A speech therapist to help you speak louder or use devices to communicate. A respiratory therapist who will check your breathing and provide respiratory care. A psychologist or counselor to get ongoing emotional and mental health support. A social worker to help with practical needs like how to pay for things or deal with insurance. A hospice nurse to help you with end-of-life care.', 'Taking Care of Yourself ALS can be a challenge, but there are ways to take control of your life. Here are some ways to support yourself: Take time to feel whatever emotions you have and adjust to your diagnosis. Learn all you can about ALS. Work with your whole medical team. Eat a balanced diet with plenty of fruits and vegetables. Create a routine to add structure to your day. Come up with activities to challenge your mind. Join an ALS support group. Ask your doctor or social worker to connect you with people who have ALS or visit the website of the ALS Association to find support groups in your area.', ""What to Expect At first, your muscles get weak or stiff. You may have more trouble with fine movements -- such as trying to button a shirt or turn a key. You may stumble or fall more than usual. After a while, you can't move the muscles, including those in your head, neck, and throat."", 'Right now, there isn’t a cure for ALS. Most people live 2 to 5 years with the condition, although around 10% of people may live up to 10 years or longer after their diagnosis. An even smaller group may live more than 30 years. You should still be able to taste, touch, smell, and hear. But for a minority of people with ALS, the disease may affect memory and your ability to make sound decisions. Eventually, people with ALS lose control of all their voluntary muscles and will be paralyzed. You won’t be able to move your diaphragm, the muscle in the chest that helps you breathe. Most people from ALS die because they can’t breathe without the help of a machine. This is called respiratory failure.', 'How ALS Might Change Over Time ALS is a progressive condition that causes you to lose control of your muscles in stages. At first, you may notice mild weakness, muscle twitching, or slurred speech that worsens over a few weeks. As the disease progresses, you’ll lose control of more vital voluntary muscles. ALS is fatal for everyone who gets it, but the timeline is tough to predict. Your symptoms may worsen gradually over months or years or level off after a period of fast progression. If you want to know more, ask your doctor what signs and symptoms to watch for and when you might need daily assistance or more help.', 'Caring for Your Emotional and Mental Health There’s no right way to react to ALS, and it’s natural to go through a range of emotions after your diagnosis. You may feel angry, sad, or scared. Many people feel anticipatory grief -- a strong sense of grief about future losses. Strong feelings like shock may ease over time, while others, including death anxiety, may grow stronger. These mood symptoms can affect you just as much as physical problems. The good news is there are ways to boost your well-being no matter what you’re going through. Your emotional and mental health support team may include a mix of people, including: Friends and family Others with ALS Psychologists or psychiatrists Social workers Spiritual and grief counselors Most people with ALS don’t get anxiety or depressive disorders. But you should check in with your doctor if you have trouble managing your moods or can’t control negative thoughts and worries. Mental health treatment, including behavioral therapy, can help teach you skills to adapt to life with ALS.', 'Information for Caregivers Like your loved one with ALS, you’re not in this alone. Reach out to friends, family, or neighbors when you need support. Most people are happy to help, they just don’t know how. Be specific about your emotional or practical needs. Ask the doctor or social worker how you can get respite care. This is a type of relief offered to caregivers. During respite care, someone will stay with your loved one while you take a break for a few hours or a few days. You can run errands, rest in another part of your house, or take a short vacation. The ALS Association’s Care Connection program can also match you with volunteers in your area who can tackle some of your everyday tasks. For example, you can ask for help with meals, rides to medical visits, or childcare. You can also reach out to others who know what you’re going through. Caregivers who confide in each other often report less stress and other problems. Visit the ALS Association website to find an ALS Support Group in your area.', 'It’s important to ask for help when you need it because caregivers for people with ALS face higher odds of burnout. This is a type of physical, emotional, or mental tiredness caused by ongoing stress. Your chances of anxiety or depression also go up if your loved one needs constant care, but there are ways to bolster your well-being. Here are some ways to practice self-care: Make sleep, healthy eating, and exercise a daily priority. Carve out some “me time” each day. Read a book, see a movie, or do something else you enjoy. Meet a friend or another caregiver for a supportive talk. Know when to say no. You’ll also want to learn stress-management skills. Here are some techniques that may help you feel calm: Deep-breathing exercises Yoga Tai chi Progressive muscle relaxation Meditation Talk to a professional counselor or therapist if you’re unsure how to manage stress or mood problems. Let them know if you have symptoms like pain, hopelessness, anger, trouble sleeping, or fatigue that don’t go away. These could be signs you need professional mental health treatment to feel better.', 'Finding Support If you or a loved one is diagnosed with ALS, you may go through a range of emotions. Remember there’s no right way to feel about this disease. Give yourself time to let the news settle in. Once you’re ready to learn more, ask your doctor or social worker how to find resources in your area. Let them know if you’re looking for practical help or emotional support. Informational websites and social groups can help you connect with other like-minded people. You can start by searching online for “ALS support groups near me” to see what pops up. You’ll also find more info about how to find in-person or virtual support groups through: I Am ALS ALS Association ALS Facebook groups']"
38,Management of Back Pain,"['There can be many causes of back pain including accidents, strains, and injuries. Two types of back injury are spondylolisthesis and cervical radiculopathy. Both have their own set of symptoms, causes, and treatments. The spine, or backbone, is made up of a column of 33 bones and tissue extending from the skull to the pelvis. These bones, or vertebrae, enclose and protect a cylinder of nerve tissues known as the spinal cord. Between each one of the vertebrae is an intervertebral disk, or band of cartilage serving as a shock absorber between the vertebrae. The types of vertebrae are: Cervical vertebrae: the seven vertebrae forming the upper part of the spine Thoracic vertebrae: the 12 bones between the neck and the lower back Lumbar vertebrae: the five largest and strongest vertebrae located in the lower back between the chest and hips The sacrum and coccyx are the bones at the base of the spine. The sacrum is made up of five vertebrae fused together, while the coccyx (tailbone) is formed from four fused vertebrae.', 'What Causes Back Pain? The causes of back pain can be complex. Some causes of back pain include accidents, muscle strains, and sports injuries.', ""How Is Back Pain Diagnosed? In addition to performing a complete history and physical exam for your back pain , your doctor may suggest one of the following diagnostic studies: X-rays , which can be used to provide detail of the bone structures in the spine and to check for instability (such as spondylolisthesis, see below), tumors, and fractures CT scans , which can identify specific conditions, such as a herniated disc or spinal stenosis MRI scans , which can provide details about the backs' discs and nerve roots. MRI scans are most commonly used for pre-surgical planning A number of other imaging and electrical studies may also be used to identify back problems, and some injections are used for diagnostic purposes as well as for pain relief."", 'Types of Back Injury Two main types of back injury include: Spondylolisthesis: This is a slipping of vertebra that occurs, in most cases, at the base of the spine. Spondylolysis, which is a defect or fracture of one or both wing-shaped parts of a vertebra, results in this vertebral slipping backward, forward, or over a bone below. Cervical Radiculopathy : Cervical radiculopathy is the damage or disturbance of nerve function that results if one of the nerve roots near the cervical vertebrae is compressed. Damage to nerve roots in the cervical area can cause pain , weakness, and the loss of sensation in the neck, arms, or shoulders, depending on where the damaged roots are located.', 'Causes of Spondylolisthesis There are many causes for Spondylolisthesis. A vertebra might be defective from the time a person is born, or a vertebra may be broken by trauma or a stress fracture. In addition, vertebrae can be broken down by infection or disease.', 'Symptoms of Spondylolisthesis Symptoms of Spondylolisthesis may include: Lower back pain Muscle tightness and stiffness Pain in the buttocks Pain radiating down the legs (due to pressure on nerve roots) Muscle weakness', 'Spondylolisthesis Treatments Spondylolisthesis is treated with the strengthening of supportive abdominal and back muscles through physical therapy . Acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines, such as ketoprofen ( Frotek) , ibuprofen ( Motrin , Advil ),\xa0and naproxen ( Aleve , Naprosyn )\xa0may help with pain. Epidural steroid injections may also be effective. For patients who continue to have severe pain and disability despite these treatments, there are options such as decompressive laminectomy, a procedure in which the spinal canal is widened (to provide more room for nerves and a spinal fusion is performed to stabilize the spinal cord), with or without surgical fusion ( arthrodesis ) of the vertebra, or the use of an implanted device to stabilize the vertebrae in the lower back while permitting more normal movement.', 'Causes of Cervical Radiculopathy In cervical radiculopathy, damage can occur as a result of pressure from material from a ruptured disc, degenerative changes in bones, arthritis, or other injuries that put pressure on the nerve roots. In older people, normal degenerative changes in the discs can cause pressure on nerve roots. In younger people, cervical radiculopathy tends to be the result of a ruptured disc. This disc material then compresses the nerve root, causing pain.', 'Symptoms of Cervical Radiculopathy The main symptom of cervical radiculopathy is pain that spreads into the arm, neck, chest, and/or shoulders. A person with radiculopathy may experience muscle weakness and/or numbness or tingling in fingers or hands. Other symptoms may include lack of coordination, especially in the hands.', 'Cervical Radiculopathy Treatment Cervical radiculopathy may be treated with a combination of pain medications such as acetaminophen ( Tylenol ), or nonsteroidal pain medication such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), ketoprofen (Frotek), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), and physical therapy. Steroids may be prescribed either orally or injected epidurally (into the epidural space that surrounds the spinal cord). Physical therapy might include gentle cervical traction and mobilization, exercises, and other modalities to reduce pain. If significant compression on the nerve exists to the extent that motor weakness results, surgery may be necessary to relieve the pressure.']"
39,Spinal MRI,"['What Is a Spinal MRI? A spinal MRI, or magnetic resonance imaging , uses powerful magnets, radio waves, and a computer to make clear, detailed pictures of your spine. You may need this scan to check for spine problems, including: Low back pain Neck pain Numbness, tingling, and weakness in your arms and legs The MRI may scan your whole spine or just a part of it. Unlike X-rays and computerized tomography (CT) scans, it doesn’t use damaging radiation. It’s generally safe and painless. The doctor will let you know about any possible risks you may face. They’ll also tell you if you can’t get the procedure because of certain implants that you have.', 'Why You Might Need a Spinal MRI You’ll get one if you have trouble breathing or coughing after an injury to your spine -- this is an emergency situation. The MRI also lets your doctor examine the small bones, called vertebrae, which make up your spinal column, as well as the spinal disks, spinal canal, and spinal cord. The test looks for: Fractures in the vertebrae Injuries Infection Swelling Spinal cord problems Bulging or slipped spinal disks Tumors Unusual parts or curves in your spine Compression (or pressure) of your nerves or your spinal cord', 'Your doctor may also use a spine MRI to help plan surgeries on the spine, like for a pinched nerve , or for procedures like epidural or steroid shots. If you have any of these symptoms, you might need a spinal MRI: Lower back (lumbar) pain Neck (cervical) pain Mid-spinal (thoracic) pain (less common) Pain radiating to arms and chest Pain radiating to legs Stiffness in your lower back area that restricts range of motion You can’t maintain a normal posture because of stiffness and/or pain Muscle spasms during activity or inactivity (resting) Pain that lasts for 10-14 days Loss of motor function in feet -- you can’t tiptoe or you do a “heel walk” Loss of control of your bladder or bowels Numbness or tingling in hands, fingers, feet or toes Weakness or paralysis in any part of your body Difficulty walking and keeping your balance', 'Risks of Spinal MRI MRI scans are considered safer than CT scans or X-rays. However, there are risks. MRIs use a magnet that creates a strong magnetic field. This can cause problems such as: Pulling or moving medical devices inside your body Heating devices and causing burns Causing electrically active medical devices to malfunction Causing Injuries if magnetic objects become projectiles', 'The presence of medical devices can also affect the quality of the MRI image. Your doctor will check beforehand to see if and what type of devices you may have and if it’s OK for you to get a scan. Devices that aren’t or may not be compatible with MRI include: Implants such as pacemakers, cochlear implants, stents and artificial joints. If you have any of these, your doctor or the MRI technologist may ask for the make and model of the device to see whether it’s safe for you to get an MRI. Metal objects such as surgical clips, plates, screws or wire mesh. If you have these you may not be able to get an MRI on that part of your body. External devices like an external insulin pump, leg brace, ventilator, patient monitor or wound dressing. They may prevent you from getting an MRI. Other risks of MRI include: Claustrophobia . Some people get this from having to go into the MRI tube or tunnel. You can take anti-anxiety medication ahead of the procedure to help with this or try an open MRI machine. Allergic reaction or sensitivity to contrast dye. Sometimes doctors use dyes with MRIs. Some people are allergic to these chemicals and shouldn’t get MRIs. Possible effect on pregnancy/unborn child . There’s no evidence that an MRI has any adverse effect on a baby. However, doctors usually try to avoid MRIs during the first trimester of pregnancy. Thermal Injuries or burns. An implanted medical device could heat up and burn you. Or you might come into contact with heated coils or cables in the scanner. Hearing loss or ringing in the ears (tinnitus). High noise levels can cause hearing loss or ringing in the ears Crushed or pinched fingers. Your hand could get stuck in the moving table you’re lying on. Falls. You could fall off the table.', 'How Do I Prepare for a Spinal MRI? Usually\xa0you can eat, drink, and take medication as you normally do before the procedure. You may wear a gown, or your own clothes if they’re loose and don’t have any metal. You’ll need to remove any eyeglasses , hearing aids , jewelry, your watch, body piercings, dentures, and other metal items. Let your doctor know if you: Have any serious health problems, such as kidney or liver disease Recently had surgery Have any allergies or asthma Are pregnant , or think you may be Wear a medicine patch Y our medical team will check to see if any implants or medical devices in your body are compatible with the MRI machine. If you have tattoos or permanent makeup , talk to your doctor. Some inks contain iron that could heat up during the test. If you don’t like being cooped up in small spaces or you’re nervous about the test, tell your doctor. They can give you medicine to help you relax.', 'Spinal MRI Procedure An MRI machine is a long, narrow tube with both ends open. A magnet surrounds the tube. You lie on a table that slides into the tube. Some MRI machines have much larger openings or are open on the sides so you don’t have to slide into a tube. They may be a good choice if you’re overweight or fear tight spaces. The doctor will decide which MRI machine will work best for you. Before some MRIs, the doctor might need to inject a dye into a vein in your arm or hand . It helps them see any infection, tumor, or disk problem in your spine. The dye most often used in MRIs is called gadolinium. You might feel flush or cold for a few moments afterward. It can also leave a salty or metal taste in your mouth . You’ll lie on the table that slides into the MRI machine. The doctor may use straps to help keep you in the right position during the test. A radiologist and technologist will be at a computer\xa0outside of the room. They can see, hear, and talk to you the whole time. Sometimes a family member or friend can stay in the room with you. Often an MRI exam includes a number of runs, or sequences. Each run can last from a few seconds to several minutes. You have to stay very still during each one. The MRI machine creates a strong magnetic field around you. A computer takes the signals from the MRI and uses them to make a series of pictures. Each picture shows a thin slice of your body. You won’t feel any pain during the test. But you may feel warmth in the area of your spine being scanned. You’ll also hear a loud tapping or thumping when the image is being recorded. Earplugs or headsets can help block out the noise if it bothers you. You can even listen to music . MRI scans can take from 30 minutes to an hour or more, depending on how much of your spine is being scanned. After a spine MRI, you can go back to your normal activities right away. But if you had medicine to relax before the test, you’ll need to wait until it wears off. Sometimes contrast dye can cause side effects. You might feel nauseated or have a headache , or you might have some pain where the dye was injected. An allergic reaction to the dye is rare. But if you get hives , itchy eyes, or any other symptoms, tell your radiologist right away.', 'Your Results A specially trained doctor called a radiologist will look over your spine MRI and report the results to your doctor. Your doctor will explain what they mean and what to do next. It may take up to a week or more to get your results.']"
40,"Low Blood Pressure (Hypotension): Symptoms, Causes, and Treatment","[""What Is Low Blood Pressure? Hypotension is the medical term for low blood pressure . You have it when a reading shows your blood pressure is much lower than expected. A blood pressure reading appears as two numbers. The top number is a measure of systolic pressure, or the pressure in the arteries when the heart beats and fills them with blood. The bottom number measures diastolic pressure, the pressure in the arteries when the heart rests between beats. The optimal blood pressure level is less than 120/80. (You may also see it written as 120/80 mmHg). What is considered low blood pressure? Doctors consider you to have low blood pressure when your reading is less than 90/60. The risk of both low and high blood pressure increases with age due in part to normal changes during aging. Is low blood pressure serious? In healthy people, low blood pressure without any symptoms isn't usually a concern and doesn't require treatment. But low blood pressure can be a sign of an underlying problem -- especially in older people -- and could reduce blood flow to the heart, brain, and other vital organs."", ""Long-lasting low blood pressure with no symptoms is almost never serious. But you can have health problems when your blood pressure drops suddenly and your brain doesn't have an adequate blood supply. This can lead to dizziness , lightheadedness, and sometimes fainting. Types of low blood pressure There are several types of low blood pressure: Postural hypotension. Sudden drops in blood pressure most often happen when you rise from a lying or sitting position to standing. This is called postural hypotension or orthostatic hypotension. It happens when your cardiovascular or nervous system doesn't react appropriately to sudden position changes. An estimated 10% to 20% of people over 65 have postural hypotension. Neurally mediated hypotension . You can get this type when you stand up for a long time. It's thought to happen because of communication problems between your brain and your heart. It's more common in younger people. Postprandial hypotension. Sometimes, your blood pressure drops an hour or two after a meal. It’s thought to be caused by blood pooling into the vessels of the stomach and intestines . It's most common in older people with high blood pressure or nervous system conditions like Parkinson's disease. It tends to happen after large meals containing \xa0lots of carbohydrates. Multiple system atrophy with orthostatic hypotension. This rare type of low blood pressure happens when you're lying down. It involves your involuntary nervous system, which controls things like your blood pressure, breathing, and heart rate. Low blood pressure (hypotension) has many causes. Often, it has no symptoms. Photo credit:  E+ / Getty Images"", ""Causes of Low Blood Pressure The cause of low blood pressure isn't always clear. It may be linked to: Pregnancy Hormonal problems such as an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism), diabetes, or low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) Some over-the-counter medications Some prescription medicines such as for high blood pressure, depression, or Parkinson’s disease Heart failure Heart arrhythmias (abnormal heart rhythms) Heart valve disease Widening, or dilation, of the blood vessels Heat exhaustion or heat stroke Liver disease Bed rest for long periods Anemia caused by shortages of vitamin B12, iron, and folate"", 'What Causes a Sudden Drop in Blood Pressure? Sudden drops in blood pressure can be life-threatening. Causes of this type of hypotension include: Loss of blood from bleeding Low body temperature High body temperature Heart muscle disease causing heart failure Sepsis, a severe blood infection Severe dehydration from vomiting, diarrhea, or fever A reaction to medication or alcohol A severe allergic reaction\xa0called anaphylaxis\xa0that causes an irregular heartbeat', 'Postural Hypotension Postural hypotension, which causes dizziness upon standing, can happen to anyone for a variety of reasons, such as dehydration, lack of food, or being overly fatigued. It can also be influenced by: Your genes Aging Medication your diet Psychological factors Conditions like infection and allergy', ""Postural hypotension happens most often in people who are taking drugs to control high blood pressure (hypertension). It can also be related to pregnancy, strong emotions, hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis), or diabetes . Older people are particularly affected, especially those who have high blood pressure or autonomic nervous system dysfunction. Several drugs are linked to postural hypotension. They can be divided into two main categories: Drugs used to treat high blood pressure, such as diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium-channel blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors Drugs that have hypotension as a side effect, including nitrates, erectile dysfunction (ED) medications, drugs for Parkinson's disease, antipsychotics, neuroleptics, anti-anxiety agents, sedative-hypnotics, and tricyclic antidepressants Common causes of naturally occurring postural hypotension include: Dehydration and electrolyte loss, which may result from diarrhea, vomiting, excessive blood loss during your period, or other conditions Age-related declines in blood pressure regulation, which may be made worse by certain health conditions or medications Certain diseases can also cause postural hypotension. These include: Nerve problems, such as peripheral neuropathy or autonomic neuropathy Cardiovascular disorders Alcoholism Nutritional diseases"", 'What Are the Symptoms of Low Blood Pressure? Low blood pressure symptoms can include: Dizziness Lightheadedness Unsteadiness Dimming or blurring of vision Agitation or other behavior changes Weakness Fatigue or lethargy Confusion Nausea Cold, clammy\xa0skin Fainting Pale skin If your\xa0blood pressure gets seriously low, your body might not get enough oxygen to carry out its normal functions.

Drink lots of nonalcoholic fluids. Limit alcoholic beverages. Drink more fluids during hot weather and while sick with a viral illness, such as a cold or the\xa0flu. Have your doctor check your prescription and over-the-counter medications to see if any of them are causing your symptoms. Get regular exercise to promote\xa0blood flow. Be careful when rising from lying down or sitting. To improve circulation, pump your\xa0feet and\xa0ankles a few times before standing up. Then go slowly. When you get out of bed, sit upright on the edge of the bed for a few minutes before standing. Raise the head of your bed at night by placing bricks or blocks under it. Avoid heavy lifting. Avoid straining while on the toilet. Avoid standing still for long periods. Avoid prolonged exposure to hot water, such as hot showers and spas. If you get dizzy, sit down. It may help to keep a chair or stool in the shower in case you need to sit. To prevent injury, use a nonslip chair or stool designed for use in showers and bath tubs. To avoid problems with low blood pressure and lessen episodes of dizziness after meals, try eating smaller, more frequent meals. Cut back on carbohydrates. Rest after eating. Avoid taking drugs to lower blood pressure before meals.', ""If needed, use elastic support (compression) stockings that cover the\xa0calf and thigh. These help restrict blood flow to your legs, thus keeping more blood in your upper body. Medications for low blood pressure If these steps don't lessen the problem, you may need medication. These drugs are sometimes used to treat low blood pressure: Fludrocortisone. This medication seems to help some types of low blood pressure. It works by promoting sodium retention by your kidneys . This causes fluid retention and some swelling, which is necessary to improve blood pressure. But sodium retention also causes a loss of\xa0potassium. So when taking fludrocortisone, make sure you get enough potassium each day. Fludrocortisone has none of the anti-inflammatory properties of\xa0cortisone or\xa0prednisone and doesn't build muscle like anabolic\xa0steroids. Midodrine. This drug activates receptors on your smallest\xa0arteries and veins to boost blood pressure. It's used to increase standing blood pressure in people who have postural hypotension related to problems with the nervous system ."", ""Complications of Low Blood Pressure Complications you could develop because of low blood pressure include: Falls. Dizziness caused by low blood pressure can make you fall or faint. Falls can result in injuries, sometimes serious ones. Heart problems or stroke : Your heart might try to make up for low blood pressure by pumping too hard or too fast. That can lead to problems like heart failure, stroke, or deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Shock. Seriously low blood pressure can limit blood supply to your organs so much that you go into shock. If you have symptoms of shock, call 911 right away. Low blood pressure during pregnancy can lead to an increased risk of falls. But there's no scientific evidence that low blood pressure by itself is harmful to your baby unless it gets low enough to send you into shock."", ""When to Call a Doctor Call your doctor if: You have any of the symptoms listed above.

41,What is Hypokalemia?,"['If you have hypokalemia , that means you have low levels of potassium in your blood . Potassium is a mineral your body needs to work normally. It helps muscles to move, cells to get the nutrients they need, and nerves to send their signals. It’s especially important for cells in your heart . It also helps keep your blood pressure from getting too high.', ""Causes There are many different reasons you could have low potassium levels. It may be because too much potassium is leaving through your digestive tract. It’s usually a symptom of another problem. Most commonly, you get hypokalemia when: You vomit a lot You have diarrhea Your kidneys or adrenal glands don’t work well You take medication that makes you pee ( water pills or diuretics) It’s possible, but rare, to get hypokalemia from having too little potassium in your diet. Other things sometimes cause it, too, like: Drinking too much alcohol Sweating a lot Folic acid deficiency Certain antibiotics Diabetic ketoacidosis (high levels of acids called ketones in your blood ) Laxatives taken over a long period of time Eating disorders Some asthma medications Low magnesium Several syndromes can be associated with low potassium, such as: Cushing's\xa0syndrome Gitelman syndrome Liddle syndrome Bartter syndrome Fanconi syndrome Women tend to get hypokalemia more often than men."", 'Symptoms If your problem is temporary, or you’re only slightly hypokalemic, you might not feel any symptoms. Once your potassium levels fall below a certain level, you might experience: Weakness Fatigue Muscle cramps or twitching Constipation Arrhythmia (abnormal heart rhythms) Hypokalemia can affect your kidneys . You may have to go to the bathroom more often. You may also feel thirsty. You may notice muscle problems during exercise . In severe cases, muscle weakness can lead to paralysis and possibly respiratory failure.', 'Diagnosis You will need a blood test for your doctor to find out if you have hypokalemia. They will ask you about your health history. They’ll want to know if you’ve had any illness that involved vomiting or diarrhea. They’ll ask about any conditions you might have that could be causing it. You may take a urine test so your doctor can find out if you’re losing potassium when you pee. Since low potassium sometimes can affect your blood pressure, your doctor will check that, too. They also may want to do an electrocardiogram (EKG) if they think you may have arrhythmia. This is one of the more serious side effects, and might change the way your doctor chooses to treat the problem.', 'Treatment You can get more potassium by taking supplements . Most of these you can take by mouth . In some cases it’s necessary to get your potassium injected by IV. For example: If your potassium level is dangerously low If taking supplements don’t raise your potassium levels If your low potassium levels cause abnormal heart rhythms When your hypokalemia is a result of another medical condition, your doctor will help you treat that. If you have low potassium because of diuretics, they may take you off them. Sometimes that makes the condition go away. Always check with your doctor before you stop any medicine. Also, ask them before you take any potassium supplements . This might cause too much potassium to build up in your system, which could lead to hyperkalemia .']"
42,"High-Protein, Low-Carb Diets Explained","['High-protein, low-carbohydrate diets, like The Atkins Diet , have been widely promoted as effective weight loss plans . These programs generally recommend that dieters get 30% to 50% of their total calories from protein. By comparison, the American Heart Association, the National Cholesterol Education Program, and the American Cancer Society all recommend a diet in which a smaller percentage of calories come from protein. The American Heart Association recommends getting 10% - 35% of your daily calories from protein. This is about\xa046 grams of protein for adult women and 56 grams for adult men.', 'How Do Low-Carb Diets Work? Carbohydrates are the main source of energy for the body. Without enough carbs for energy, the body breaks down fat into ketones. The ketones then become the primary source of fuel for the body. When ketones become the primary source of fuel, this puts your body in a state called ketosis . When your fat stores become a primary energy source, you may lose weight.', ""The Risks of High-Protein, Low-Carb Diets Some experts have raised concern about high-protein, low-carb diets. High cholesterol. Some protein sources -- like fatty cuts of meat, whole dairy products, and other high-fat foods -- can raise cholesterol , increasing your chance of heart disease. However, studies showed that people on the Atkins diet for up to 2 years actually had decreased “bad” cholesterol levels . Kidney problems. If you have any kidney problems, eating too much protein puts added strain on your kidneys . This could worsen kidney function. Osteoporosis and kidney stones . When you're on a high- protein diet , you may urinate more calcium than normal. There are conflicting reports, but some experts think this could make osteoporosis and kidney stones more likely."", ""Is a Low-Carb Diet Right for You? If you're considering a high-protein diet, check with your doctor or a nutritionist to see if it's OK for you.

43,Should You Take Aspirin for Heart Disease?,"['Aspirin has been used as a pain reliever for more than 100 years. Since the 1970s, it’s also been used to prevent and manage heart disease and stroke . Now, a top U.S. panel of health experts has published recommendations that aim to limit people’s use of daily aspirin to prevent a first heart attack or stroke. Here’s what you need to know about the finalized guideline changes, aspirin’s benefits and risks, and why it’s important to talk to your doctor to find out if taking it daily is right for you.', 'Where Do the Experts Stand on Daily Aspirin? The recommendations come from an independent panel of experts in disease prevention and evidence-based medicine called the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). The group has revamped its 2016 guidelines on aspirin after reviewing newer studies. In 2021, it released a draft version of proposed changes and made them available for public comment. Now, the task force has published its final recommendations: People 40 to 59 years old who are at higher risk for heart disease or stroke and don’t have a history of either condition should talk to their doctor about whether they should start taking aspirin as preventive step. People 60 and older shouldn’t start taking aspirin to prevent a first heart attack or stroke. The task force says the risk of internal bleeding due to aspirin, which rises with age and can be life-threatening, cancels out the benefits of preventing heart problems in people 60 and older.', 'These recommendations aren’t meant for everyone, the USPSTF says. Ask your doctor what you should do if you: Already have heart disease Have had a stroke Are already taking aspirin If you’re already taking aspirin because you’ve had a heart attack or stroke, don’t stop taking it unless your doctor tells you to, the task force says.', 'How Does Aspirin Help the Heart? It eases inflammation . Plaque may be more likely to cause a heart attack or stroke if it’s inflamed. Aspirin blocks an enzyme called cyclooxygenase. That makes your body less likely to produce chemicals that can help cause inflammation .', ""It helps prevent blood clots . Some chemicals in the blood trigger events that cause blood clots. When aspirin stops those chemicals, it helps slow the formation of the clots. That’s important because they can clog the arteries that bring blood to heart muscle and the brain , which increases your risk of heart attack and stroke . It\xa0might reduce\xa0your risk of death. A low-dose aspirin might be considered to prevent a first heart attack and stroke in a select group of adults between 40-59 who aren't at increased risk of bleeding."", ""Who Could Benefit?

It can increase your chance of having stomach ulcers and abdominal bleeding. During a stroke, aspirin can boost your risk of bleeding into the brain .', 'What Are the Benefits? Aspirin can greatly reduce the damage to your heart during a heart attack. It can help prevent future heart problems after a heart attack . It can reduce your risk of another stroke. Talk to your doctor about the benefits and risks of aspirin therapy before you begin a regular regimen.', 'How Much Should I Take? Research says between 80 milligrams and 160 milligrams per day. This is less than half of the standard 325-milligram aspirin most people are prescribed. Many studies show the lower dose works just as well as the higher dose. It also drops your risk of internal bleeding . A baby aspirin contains 81 milligrams. There are other lower-dose adult aspirins available. Check with your doctor first to find out what dose is right for you.', 'How Should I Take It? First, tell your doctor if you are allergic to aspirin, ibuprofen, or naproxen . If you get the go-ahead to start an aspirin routine, then: Don’t take it on an empty stomach . Take aspirin with a full glass of water with meals or after meals to prevent stomach upset. Don’t break, crush, or chew extended-release tablets or capsules -- swallow them whole. Chewable aspirin tablets may be chewed, crushed, or dissolved in a liquid. Aspirin should never be taken in place of other medications or treatments recommended by your doctor. Never take it with alcohol . That increases your chance of stomach bleeding.', 'Ask your doctor what other medicines you can take for pain relief or minor colds while you take aspirin. Read the labels of all pain relievers and cold products to make sure they’re aspirin-free. Other drugs with aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) may cause bleeding when taken with your regular aspirin therapy. Before any surgery, dental procedure, or emergency treatment, tell the doctor or dentist that you’re taking aspirin. You might need to stop taking it for 5 to 7 days before your procedure.

44,Back Pain: What You Need to Know,"[""There's a lot riding on your spinal column. It's your body's main structural support. It needs to keep you stable enough to stand upright but flexible enough for movement. So it's no surprise that many people have back problems from time to time. The hurt can stem from sore muscles , ligaments, and tendons, or from herniated disks, fractures , and other problems in your upper, middle, and lower back. Sometimes you feel the effects right away. But in many cases, back problems develop over time."", 'Causes We often bring on our back problems through bad habits, such as: Poor posture, like sitting incorrectly at a desk or behind the steering wheel Repeating the same motion or overdoing it Pushing, pulling, and lifting things carelessly The spine is actually a stack of 24 bones called vertebrae. A healthy spine is S-shaped when viewed from the side. It curves back at your shoulders and inward at your neck and small of your back. It houses and protects your spinal cord, the network of nerves that transmit feeling and control movement throughout your entire body.', ""One of the more common types of back pain comes from straining the bands of muscles surrounding the spine . It happens most often in the curve of the low back and the base of the neck. These areas support more weight than your upper and mid back, which are less prone to trouble. Injuries from contact sports, accidents, and falls can cause problems ranging from minor muscle strains, to herniated disks, to fractures that damage the spinal column or cord. Stabbing low back pain could be from muscle spasms, when your muscles seize up and don't relax, like a cramp. Osteoarthritis can affect your vertebrae, when the cartilage between them wears down. Bone spurs or a herniated disk can push on nerves. Pregnancy often brings on back pain , too. Hormonal changes and weight gain put new kinds of stresses on a pregnant woman's spine and legs. Sometimes your back might be sore for no clear reason. That's called nonspecific backache. It could come from weak muscles that can't handle everyday walking, bending, and stretching ."", ""Other Symptoms Back pain -- whether a dull ache or shooting -- is just one sign that something's going on with your back. You may also have feelings in your legs or arms: Radiating pain Numbness Tingling Weakness Uncontrolled peeing or pooping , or inability to pee, and muscle weakness could mean a serious problem like spinal cord compression. Call your doctor right away."", ""Diagnosis You should see a doctor: After you get hurt, like in a fall or accident When the pain gets in the way of your daily activities If it lasts longer than 6 weeks, or spreads During your exam, your doctor will test your range of motion -- unless you can't move -- and check how well your nerves are working. That may be enough to decide what to do next. You might need imaging tests, like X-rays, an MRI , or a CT scan . But they're not always useful, and there's not always a direct link between the results of these tests and how much it hurts."", ""Treatment Your specific treatment will depend on what's causing your pain and where in your back it is. Despite what you may think or have been told before, staying in bed isn't usually the answer; gentle exercise is. It will help work out the kinks, build support for your spine, and improve your flexibility. A physical therapist can work with you to design a set of exercises, give you relief from the pain, and get you moving again. Over-the-counter pain relievers, ice, and heat will work to take the edge off most back pain. Your doctor can prescribe stronger medicines, but some can make you drowsy or dependent on them if you're not careful. Complementary therapies, such as chiropractic spinal manipulation, acupuncture , and massage , can help ease pain, too. If a bone is damaged, or you have a herniated disk or pinched nerve , you may need surgery. But for ongoing back pain, doctors will try other treatments first. Counseling could help you learn to live with chronic pain better as well as deal with symptoms of depression because of it."", ""Prevention Exercise ! Strengthening the muscles around your spine and in your core will help keep you stable and balanced. Walking is great for your low back, and it's simple to do. Practice good posture. As a rule of thumb, aim to keep your ears, shoulders, and hips aligned when you sit, stand, and walk. Lift heavy things correctly, using your hips and knees for power while keeping your back straight. Try sleeping on your side, with a medium-firm mattress. Don't smoke. It restricts blood flow, so your muscles and tissues don't get a good supply of nutrients and oxygen.""]"
45,What Are Lung Carcinoid Tumors?,"['If you or someone you know has been diagnosed with carcinoid tumors in the lung , you may wonder what they are and how they’re different from other types of lung cancer . Carcinoid tumors are a rare type of lung cancer . Only 1% to 2% of lung cancers are carcinoid tumors. They usually grow slowly. They are a type of neuroendocrine tumor , meaning that they start in special cells, called neuroendocrine cells, that are found in the lungs and throughout the body.', 'Types of Carcinoid Tumors It’s important for you to know what kind of carcinoid tumor you have to get the best treatment. Carcinoid tumors are divided in two types: typical and atypical. Typical carcinoid tumors are the most common. About 9 out of 10 carcinoid tumors are called typical. They grow slowly, and they don’t usually spread outside of the lungs. Atypical carcinoid tumors grow faster, and they’re more likely to spread, or metastasize, outside of the lungs. Doctors also refer to lung carcinoid tumors based on their location. If your tumors are in the walls of the large airways of your lungs, they’re central carcinoids. If they’re found in the smaller airways closer to the edges of your lungs, they’re peripheral carcinoids. The outlook is often good. Among people with typical carcinoid tumors of the lung, about 85% to 90% live another 5 years or more, as do 50% to 70% of those with atypical carcinoids.', 'Causes and Risk Factors Researchers don’t really know the causes of carcinoid tumors in the lung. They have found that typical carcinoids don’t seem to be linked to smoking , but atypical carcinoid tumors are found more often in people who do smoke. You may be at a higher risk for these rare tumors with: Age . You can get carcinoid tumors at any age, but they happen most often in people 45 to 55 years old. Gender . Carcinoid tumors are more common in women than in men. Race/ethnicity . These tumors are more common in whites than in other racial and ethnic groups. Family history . Your risk is higher if you have family members with carcinoid tumors. Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 . This inherited syndrome raises your chances of getting lung carcinoid tumors, as well as tumors in the pancreas and the pituitary and parathyroid glands.', 'Symptoms You may not have any symptoms. Around 25% of people with these tumors don’t. Your doctor may discover them when you have tests for something else.', 'Carcinoid tumors in the lung may cause: Coughing , sometimes with blood Wheezing Chest pain Shortness of breath Sometimes carcinoid tumors cause a condition called carcinoid syndrome. That’s due to the hormones released by the cells in the tumors. Symptoms may include flushing of your face and neck, diarrhea , fast heart rate, and weight gain .', 'Diagnosis Your doctor will ask you questions about your medical history (that includes your family history) and examine you, listening to your lungs. These tests can help diagnose carcinoid tumors: Chest X-rays may show whether any tumors are in your lungs. Some may be too small or in locations that can’t be seen with standard X-rays. CT scans use X-rays and a computer to give a cross-section view of your lungs and can also show if any tumors have spread to other organs, such as your liver . Blood and urine tests may\xa0find substances that carcinoid tumors sometimes release. Serotonin or chromogranin-A in the blood may be a sign of a typical carcinoid tumor. The level of 5-HIAA, a byproduct of serotonin, can show up in your pee. A biopsy is a sample of tissue taken from your tumor and checked under a microscope. It can be done two ways. If you have a nonsurgical biopsy , you’ll probably be sedated. Your doctor may insert a bronchoscope, a type of thin, flexible camera, into your lungs to look at the tissue. If you have a surgical biopsy, you’ll have anesthesia and may need to stay in the hospital. It will take longer to recover, too. Your doctor will have to make small surgical cuts in your chest to get the sample of tissue.', 'Stages The stage of your cancer is based on the size of your tumor and whether it has spread to nearby lymph nodes or other parts of your body. Knowing the stage helps you and your doctor weigh your treatment options. Stages range from 0, the earliest, to IV, the most advanced. Doctors sometimes use letters along with the stage number to break it down even more.', 'Treatment Your doctor can help you understand the pros and cons of all your treatment options and what’s likely to be best for you. Surgery is usually the first choice, depending on how healthy you are, where your tumors are in your lungs, whether they’re typical or atypical, and what stage they are. You may get chemotherapy or radiation therapy , sometimes after surgery. If your tumors can’t be removed with surgery or have spread or returned, your doctor may recommend targeted therapy, a special type of chemotherapy. The FDA approved everolimus (Afinitor) for this purpose in 2016. Certain drugs can ease symptoms caused by hormones that your tumors release and may slow their growth. A clinical trial may be an option if other treatments aren’t a good fit for you. In clinical trials , researchers study the safety and effectiveness of new treatments. Your doctor can help you look for a clinical trial that you may be eligible for. Make sure you know what’s involved, including the risks, benefits, and where you’ll go for treatment before you sign up.']"
46,What Is Nocardiosis?,"['Nocardiosis is a disease caused by bacteria found in soil or standing water. It starts in your lungs or skin , and can cause serious problems if it gets into your bloodstream and infects other parts of your body. Nocardiosis comes in two forms. You get the pulmonary (lung) version from breathing in the bacteria. The second type is primary cutaneous (skin). That’s when the bacteria gets into an open wound like a scratch. Between 500 and 1,000 people get it each year in the United States. Men are three times more likely to be infected by it than women -- middle-aged men working outdoors are at the highest risk. You also may have a greater chance of getting it if you have a weak immune system because of a condition like diabetes , HIV , or cancer , or if you’ve had a bone-marrow or organ transplant . If you’ve taken high doses of powerful steroids (drugs that help with inflammation ), it also increases your chances.', 'Symptoms The signs can be different, depending on which type you have. Pulmonary nocardiosis is the most common, and its symptoms are a lot like ones you might have with pneumonia or tuberculosis : Chest pain Coughing Sweating Chills Feeling weak Lack of appetite Unexplained weight loss Shortness of breath or a hard time breathing The most common signs of primary cutaneous nocardiosis are skin abscesses on your hands, chest, or rear end. These are bumps on or below the skin’s surface that are usually filled with a fluid (pus). You also might have a fever. If not treated, the infection can spread through your bloodstream to your brain or, more rarely, to your kidneys , intestines , or other organs. It can be very serious. Signs that the infection has spread to your brain include: Bad headaches Motor skills problem, like balance or hand- eye coordination Extreme sensitivity to loud sounds or bright lights If you have any of these symptoms, see your doctor right away.', 'Diagnosis It can be hard to tell the difference between pulmonary nocardiosis and pneumonia or tuberculosis. And primary cutaneous nocardiosis looks a lot like several other, more common skin infections. To find out for sure, your doctor probably will take a small sample of tissue or fluid from the area where you’re infected. This might include tissue or mucus from your lungs or tissue from your skin. If the infection is in your lungs, you might get a chest X-ray -- or a CT scan , which takes X-rays from several angles and puts them together to make a more detailed image.', 'Treatment Nocardiosis usually can be cured with antibiotics , but not all of them will work against the bacteria. Your doctor might need to run some lab tests to see which ones will work best for you. Then you might need to take them for 6 weeks up to a year, depending on how serious your infection is. In some cases, you might need surgery to remove or drain abscesses in infected areas.']"
47,Understanding Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma -- the Basics,"['What Is Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma? Lymphoma refers to a malignancy of the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system is a network of nodes (knots of tissue) connected by vessels. Together, the lymph nodes drain fluid and waste products from the body. The lymph nodes act as tiny filters, removing foreign organisms and cells. Lymphocytes\xa0are a type of white blood cell that helps fight infections caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi. The lymph node function is to prevent infections from entering the bloodstream. When the lymphatic system is fighting an active infection, you may notice that some of the lymph nodes in the area of the infection become swollen and tender. This is the body’s normal reaction to an infection. Lymphoma occurs when the lymph-node cells or the lymphocytes begin to multiply uncontrollably, producing cancerous cells that have the abnormal capacity to invade other tissues throughout the body. The two main types of lymphoma are Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The differences in these two types of lymphoma are certain unique characteristics of the different lymphoma cells.', 'Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is further classified into a variety of subtypes based on the cell of origin (B-cell or T-cell), and the cell characteristics. The subtype of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma predicts the necessity of early treatment, the response to treatment, the type of treatment required, and the prognosis. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is much more common than Hodgkin lymphoma. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is the seventh most common cause of cancer -related deaths in the United States. The risk of developing non-Hodgkin lymphoma increases with age and it is more common in males than in females and in Caucasians. North America has one of the highest incidence of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.', ""What Causes Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma? The exact cause of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is unknown. However, there are multiple medical conditions that are associated with an increased risk of developing the disease: Inherited immune deficiencies Genetic syndromes: Down syndrome, Klinefelter's syndrome (a genetic condition in men caused by an extra X chromosome) Immune disorders , and their treatments: Sjögren's syndrome (an immune disorder characterized by unusual dryness of mucous membranes), rheumatoid arthritis , systemic lupus erythematosus Celiac disease, a disease involving the processing of certain components of gluten, a protein in grains Inflammatory bowel disease, particularly Crohn’s disease, and its treatment Psoriasis Family history of lymphoma Bacteria: Helicobacter pylori , associated with gastritis and gastric ulcers; Borrelia burgdorferi, associated with Lyme disease ; Campylobacter jejuni; Chlamydia psittaci Viruses: HIV , HTLV-1, SV-40, HHV-8, Epstein Barr virus, hepatitis virus Non-random chromosomal translocations and molecular rearrangements"", 'Other Factors Include: Regular exposure to certain chemicals, including insect and weed killers, and a number of chemicals used in industries such as farming, welding, and lumber Exposure to nuclear accidents, nuclear testing, or underground radiation leaks Treatment with immunosuppressant drugs, for prevention of organ transplantation rejection, or for treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune disorders Tumor necrosis factor agents used to treat psoriatic and rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease Prior exposure to chemotherapy and/or radiation used to treat a prior diagnosis of cancer Treatment with a medication called Dilantin (phenytoin), commonly used to treat seizure disorders Use of hair dyes, especially dark and permanent colors, used before 1980 (research is inconclusive) High levels of nitrates found in drinking water Diets high in fat and meat products Ultraviolet light exposure Alcohol intake']"
48,What Is Lymphedema?,"['Lymphedema is swelling that’s caused by a collection of too much lymph fluid. It usually happens in your arms and legs, but it can happen in other parts of your body, as well. This swelling may cause pain and limit how well the affected area moves. Lymph is a protein -rich fluid that moves throughout your body in lymph vessels. It scoops up things like bacteria, viruses, and waste, and carries them to your lymph nodes. Your lymph nodes then filter the fluid to get the impurities out of your body. You could get lymphedema for any number of reasons. There are treatments to help bring down the swelling so you feel and move better.', ""Causes and Types If your lymphatic system is damaged or a blockage exists, the fluid can build up in the soft tissue beneath your skin .

This swelling, which can extend into the fingers or toes, usually develops gradually over time. At first, the swelling is soft and fluid. In time, it can become more dense and fibrous, and it may make your skin look grainy. You could also have pain, heaviness, or limited range of motion in the affected limb, which may make it hard to exercise or do other activities. Over time, these symptoms may lead to other problems including infection, and in rare cases, cancer . If swelling in your arm or leg doesn’t go away, you should see your doctor.', 'Diagnosis Your doctor will want to know about your medical history. You may also get imaging tests to help diagnose the problem. A lymphoscintigraphy is a scan that can detect blockages or missing lymph vessels. It is done by injecting radioactive material. Other tests to investigate the cause of your swelling include MRI , CT scan , and ultrasound .', 'Treatment Your doctor may recommend: Compression garments: These fabric sleeves apply pressure to the affected limb to help lymph fluid circulate. Compression devices: These compression sleeves are attached to a pump that automatically applies and removes pressure on your limb on a timed schedule to prevent lymph buildup. Exercise : Gentle exercises may promote lymph drainage and strengthen your affected limb. Bandages: Wrapped in just the right way, these may help push lymph fluid toward the trunk of your body. You may also wear them to help prevent lymph fluid from going back into your affected limb. Massage : A specially trained professional can do light massage to help move fluid from areas of swelling to other areas where working lymph vessels may carry it away. You can even learn how to use these massage techniques on yourself.']"
49,What Are Lysosomal Storage Disorders?,"['Lysosomal storage disorders are a group of more than 50 rare diseases. They affect the lysosome -- a structure in your cells that breaks down substances such as proteins, carbohydrates, and old cell parts so the body can recycle them. People with these disorders are missing important enzymes (proteins that speed up reactions in the body). Without those enzymes, the lysosome isn’t able to break down these substances. When that happens, they build up in cells and become toxic. They can damage cells and organs in the body. This article covers some of the most common lysosomal storage disorders.', 'Types of Lysosomal Storage Disorders Each disorder affects a different enzyme and has its own set of symptoms. They include: Fabry disease : It affects your ability to make alpha-galactosidase A . This enzyme breaks down a fatty substance called globotriaosylceramide. Without the enzyme, this fat builds up in cells and damages them. Symptoms might include: Pain, numbness, tingling, or burning in the hands and feet Body aches Fever Tiredness Red or purple skin sores Trouble sweating Swelling in the lower legs, ankles , and feet Clouding of the cornea (the clear cover on the front of the eye ) Diarrhea , constipation , or both Trouble breathing Ringing in the ears and hearing loss Dizziness Abnormal heart rhythms, heart attack , and stroke', 'Gaucher disease : A lack of glucocerebrosidase (GBA) causes this condition. This enzyme breaks down a fat called glucocerebroside. Without GBA, the fat builds up in the spleen , liver , and bone marrow. Gaucher disease comes in three types, each with different symptoms. In general, symptoms include: Anemia (low red blood cell count) Enlarged spleen and liver Easy bleeding and bruising Tiredness Bone pain and fractures Joint pain Eye problems Seizures Krabbe disease: This affects the nervous system . A lack of the enzyme galactosylceramidase causes this condition. This enzyme helps make and maintain myelin , the protective coating around nerve cells that helps nerves talk to each other. Symptoms start in the first few months of life and include: Muscle weakness Stiff limbs Trouble walking Vision and hearing loss Muscle spasms Seizures Metachromatic leukodystrophy ( MLD ): You can get MLD if you don’t have the enzyme arylsulfatase A . It normally breaks down a group of fats called sulfatides. Without the enzyme, these fats build up in white matter -- the part of the brain that contains nerve fibers. They destroy the myelin coating that surrounds and protects nerve cells.', ""MLD comes in different forms. Symptoms can include: Loss of feeling in the hands and feet Seizures Trouble walking and talking Vision and hearing loss Mucopolysaccharidosis ( MPS ): This is a group of diseases that affects enzymes that break down certain carbohydrates. The unbroken carbohydrates build up in many different organs. Symptoms of MPS affect many parts of the body and can include: Short height Stiff joints Trouble speaking and hearing Ongoing runny nose Learning problems Heart issues Joint problems Trouble breathing Depression Niemann-Pick disease: This is a group of disorders. The most common forms are types A, B, and C. In types A and B, people lack an enzyme called acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) . It breaks down a fatty substance called sphingomyelin, which is found in every cell. In type C, the body can't break down cholesterol and fats in cells. Cholesterol builds up in the liver and spleen. Other fats build up in the brain . Symptoms of Niemann-Pick include: An enlarged liver and spleen Trouble moving your eyes up and down Jaundice (yellow skin and eyes ) Slow development Breathing problems Heart disease"", 'Pompe disease : It affects the enzyme alpha-glucosidase (GAA) . This enzyme breaks down the sugar glycogen into glucose. Without GAA, glycogen builds up in muscle cells and other cells. Symptoms include: Severe muscle weakness Poor muscle tone Lack of growth and weight gain in infants An enlarged heart , liver, or tongue Tay-Sachs disease: This is caused by a lack of the enzyme hexosaminidases A (Hex-A) . This enzyme breaks down a fatty substance called GM2 ganglioside in brain cells. Without it, the fat builds up in nerve cells and damages them. Babies with Tay-Sachs grow normally for the first few months of life. Then their development slows. They lose control over their muscles. It becomes harder for them to sit, crawl, and walk. Other symptoms include: A red spot in the back of the eye Vision and hearing loss Seizures', ""How Do These Disorders Happen? Most lysosomal storage disorders are passed down from parents to their children. Usually, a child has to inherit the faulty gene from both parents. If a child gets the gene from only one parent, they will be a carrier and won't show symptoms."", 'The faulty genes affect how your body makes enzymes that break down material in the cells. Lysosomal storage diseases are rare, but some forms are more common in certain groups of people. For example, Gaucher and Tay-Sachs happen more often in people of European Jewish descent.', 'Symptoms The symptoms depend on which enzyme is missing. Each of these conditions has different symptoms based on the cells and organs it affects.', ""Diagnosis Your doctor can test for these disorders in your baby during pregnancy . If you have a child with symptoms, blood tests can look for the enzyme that's missing. The doctor might also do these tests: MRI uses powerful magnets and radio waves to make pictures of the brain . Biopsy removes a small piece of tissue, which is checked under a microscope for signs of disease. Finding these diseases early is key. Treatments can slow lysosomal storage disorders and improve your child's outlook."", ""Treatments Though there isn't a cure for lysosomal storage disorders, a few treatments can help. Enzyme replacement therapy delivers the missing enzyme through a vein (IV). Substrate reduction therapy reduces the substance that is building up in the cells. For example, the drug miglustat (Zavesca) treats one form of Gaucher disease. Stem cell transplant uses donated cells to help the body make the enzyme it's missing. Treatments to manage symptoms of the disease include: Medicine Surgery Physical therapy Dialysis (a treatment that removes toxic substances from the body)""]"
