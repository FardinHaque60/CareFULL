0,What Are Urea Cycle Disorders?,"Urea cycle disorders (UCDs) are a group of diseases. They make it hard for your child’s body to remove waste products as they digest proteins. They are inherited diseases -- you pass them down to your child. In most cases, you can manage them with diet and medications . When your baby eats protein , their body breaks it down into amino acids and uses what they need. What they don’t need is further broken down into waste products that their body removes. This happens in a process called the urea cycle. Your baby’s liver makes things called enzymes that turn waste nitrogen into urea. The urea leaves their body in their urine . If your child has a urea cycle disorder, their liver can’t make one of the enzymes the cycle needs. When their body can’t remove nitrogen, ammonia forms and collects in their blood . It’s toxic and can cause brain damage or put them in a coma . It can even be fatal if you don’t treat it quickly. Who Gets Them? UCDs affect about 1 in 35,000 newborns. There are eight types. They’re named after what’s missing from the urea cycle. You’ll also hear doctors call them by their initials: ARG1 deficiency -- Arginase ASL deficiency -- Argininosuccinate lyase ASS1 deficiency -- Argininosuccinate synthase 1 Citrin deficiency -- Citrin CPSI deficiency -- Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I NAGS deficiency -- N-acetylglutamate synthase ORNT1 deficiency -- Ornithine translocase OTC deficiency -- Ornithine transcarbamylase Parents pass these diseases down to their children through defective genes. We all inherit two copies of our genes, one from each parent. With most UCDs, you must get a defective gene from both parents to get the disease. The genes tell your child’s body how to break down protein. One UCD, called ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency, is what doctors call a sex-linked disorder. Mothers carry the gene on their X chromosome , and they mostly pass it to their sons. Symptoms UCDs fall into two groups: Complete UCD: This means your baby has a severe or total lack of the enzyme. You’ll notice symptoms in the first couple of days: Fussy Sleepy or sluggish Can’t feed Vomits Low body temperature Problems with posture Seizures Fast breathing that becomes slow Coma Partial UCD: Your baby can make some of the enzyme, but not as much as they need. You may not spot symptoms for months or even years. A buildup of ammonia (you may hear the doctor call it hyperammonemia) can happen from illness, injury, stress , or quick weight loss. Symptoms are usually less severe than in babies with complete UCD. They include: Avoiding foods high in protein or a dislike of meat Loss of appetite Nausea or vomiting Behavior problems, including hyperactivity Mental problems (confusion, delusions , hallucinations , psychosis ) Diagnosis Most newborns in the U.S. are tested for ASS1 and ASL, but how well the tests work is different in each state. Many states test for arginase and citrin deficiencies. A handful also test for OTC and CPS1 deficiencies. If your baby starts to show symptoms after you get home, the doctor will do a physical exam . They’ll ask about your family history and do tests. They’ll look for ammonia in your child’s blood and amino acid in their blood and urine. The doctor can take a tiny piece of their liver through a process called biopsy . They’ll test it for enzymes. Genetic tests will usually confirm the diagnosis. Treatment UCDs are life-threatening. Don’t wait to get treatment. A team of health professionals will care for your child. They will first do these three treatments at the same time: Dialysis to remove ammonia from their blood Feeding them supplements of sugars, fats, and amino acids Medicines to remove extra nitrogen Long-term treatment can manage UCD symptoms. Your child will need frequent blood tests throughout their life to check ammonia levels. Stresses on their body -- like illness, injury, or surgery -- can cause their levels to rise. During those times, you’ll need to give them extra calories so their body has plenty of fuel. Long-term treatment will include: A low protein, high-calorie diet Medications to remove nitrogen Supplements of amino acids Drinking plenty of water A liver transplant can reverse the symptoms of a urea cycle disorder. Outlook There’s no cure for UCDs. Your child’s long-term health depends on which UCD they have, how severe it is, how early it was diagnosed, and how closely you follow the treatment plan. If your child doesn’t follow the special diet or they have frequent stress -induced symptoms, repeated brain swelling can lead to irreversible brain damage. If they’re diagnosed early and follow their diet, they can live a normal life."
1,What Is a Peptic Ulcer?,"You have a peptic ulcer if you get open sores in the lining of your stomach or the upper part of the small intestine. That happens when your stomach acids etch away your digestive tract’s protective layer of mucus . You may have no symptoms, or you may feel discomfort or burning pain. Peptic ulcers can lead to internal bleeding, which sometimes can mean you’ll need blood transfusions in the hospital. You can have two types of peptic ulcer disease: Gastric ulcer . You get this on your stomach lining. Duodenal ulcer. This appears at the top end of the small intestine, an organ that digests and absorbs much of the food you eat. You can have ulcers at any age, but your chances go up as you get older. What Causes Peptic Ulcers? Ulcers form when digestive juices damage the walls of the stomach or small intestine. If the mucus layer gets too thin or your stomach makes too much acid, your gut will feel it. The two major causes are: Bacteria. It’s called Helicobacter pylori ( H. pylori ), and as many as half of us carry it. Most people infected with H. pylori do not get ulcers. But in others, it can raise the amount of acid, break down the protective mucus layer, and irritate the digestive tract. Experts aren’t sure how H. pylori infection spreads. They think it may pass from person to person through close contact, like kissing . You may also get it from unclean food and water. Certain pain relievers. If you’ve been taking aspirin often and for a long time, you’re more likely to get a peptic ulcer . The same is true for other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ). They include ibuprofen and naproxen . NSAIDs block your body from making a chemical that helps protect the inner walls of your stomach and small intestine from stomach acid. Other types of pain meds, such as acetaminophen , won’t lead to peptic ulcers. Smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol also can make you more likely to get ulcers.  S tress and eating a lot of spicy food don’t cause ulcers, as experts once thought. But they can make ulcers worse and harder to treat. What Are the Symptoms of a Peptic Ulcer? You’ll most likely feel a burning pain or discomfort between your belly button and breastbone. You might especially notice it on an empty stomach -- such as between meals or at night. The pain may stop for a little while if you eat or take an antacid, but then return. The pain can last for a few minutes or a few hours, and may come and go for many days or weeks. Other symptoms may include: Bloated feeling Burping Lack of appetite or weight loss Nausea Bloody or dark poop Vomiting Small ulcers may not cause any symptoms. But if you notice any of these signs, talk to your doctor. How Is a Peptic Ulcer Diagnosed? Your doctor will ask about your symptoms, whether you take NSAIDs and other drugs, and medical history. They’ll also check you for bloating in the belly and pain. That may be enough to make a diagnosis. The only way your doctor can tell for sure if you have an ulcer is to look. They may use a series of X-rays or a test called an endoscopy . This test allows them to pass a thin, bendy tube down your throat and into your stomach and small intestine. The tube has a camera at the end so they can check the lining for ulcers. They may also take a small piece of the lining to test for H. pylori . Blood , breath, and stool sample tests also can screen for the bacteria. How Is a Peptic Ulcer Treated? Some peptic ulcers heal on their own. But if you don’t treat them, the ulcers tend to come back. They can erode the blood vessel wall in your stomach or small intestine. The ulcers also can eat a hole through the lining and get infected. Or they can cause swelling, which may block food from moving from your stomach into your small intestine. If H. pylori is the culprit, your doctor may prescribe a mix of antibiotics to kill it. If aspirin and other NSAIDs are behind the ulcer, you may need to cut down on them, stop taking them altogether, or switch to another pain reliever. Your doctor may also give you antacids to fight stomach acid, or prescribe medicine to lessen the acid your body makes. Prescription drugs called cytoprotective agents can help protect the lining of the stomach or small intestine so the ulcer can heal. Can You Prevent a Peptic Ulcer? While stress and spicy foods can make symptoms of a peptic ulcer worse, they don’t seem to make you more likely to have one. But a few other things can raise your chances. Be careful when you take pain relievers. Some people who have arthritis or other conditions that cause chronic pain take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) for weeks or months at a time to ease pain and swelling. These medicines can affect the mucus that protects your stomach against acid and make you more likely to have peptic ulcers. These pain relievers include: Aspirin Ibuprofen Naproxen sodium You're more likely to get an ulcer while taking one of these if you: Are over age 65 Are infected with H. pylori bacteria Take more than one NSAID at a time Have had a peptic ulcer in the past Also take a steroid drug or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) To lower your chances for peptic ulcers while you take NSAIDs: Use the lowest possible dose to control your symptoms, and stop taking them as soon as you no longer need them. Take your medicine with food. Don't drink alcohol while you’re taking these medicines. While you're on NSAIDs, you can take medicine to lower the amount of acid your stomach makes. Drugs that can do that include: Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) like esomeprazole ( Nexium ), omeprazole ( Prilosec OTC), and pantoprazole ( Protonix ) H2 blockers such as cimetidine ( Tagamet ), famotidine ( Pepcid ), and nizatidine You can also take the drug misoprostol ( Cytotec ) to boost the amount of protective mucus your stomach makes. But that can cause side effects like diarrhea and stomach cramps. Don’t smoke, and limit alcohol. These two habits make you more likely to get peptic ulcers. Both thin the mucus lining that protects your stomach from acid, leading to more acid. Ask your doctor to recommend a program to help you quit smoking . And talk with them about how much alcohol is safe for you to drink. Manage stress. Stress can make the symptoms of a peptic ulcer worse. Figure out what’s causing issues for you and see how you can deal with it better. For example, getting enough sleep can help with that. It also can boost your immune system . Consider probiotics. Millions of bacteria normally live in your gut. Some, like H. pylori , cause disease. Others are good for you because they help crowd out harmful bacteria. These helpful bacteria are called probiotics . They’re still being studied, but researchers think they may help with peptic ulcers . You can find them in foods like these: Dairy products that have live cultures, like yogurt, kefir, and aged cheeses Sauerkraut Kimchi Miso Tempeh Prevent H. pylori infection. About two-thirds of people around the world have this type of infection, but most don’t get ulcers because of it. Doctors don’t know how you can avoid H. pylori , but they think it spreads from person to person or through food or water . You can do some things to make an infection less likely: Wash your hands often during the day with warm water and soap so you don't catch or spread H. pylori bacteria. Clean your hands before you eat and after you go to the bathroom. If you don't have soap and water close by, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Cook meat and other foods all the way through. Only drink water that you know is clean."
2,Upper Limb Spasticity,"What Is Upper Limb Spasticity? Upper limb spasticity is a condition that affects the way you move your arms. It makes your muscles stiff and flexed. Sometimes, your arms will twitch or move in a way you can’t control, called a spasm. Spasticity happens after your body’s nervous system has been damaged, usually by a stroke , disease, or injury. It’s not life-threatening, but it can be painful and have a big effect on your daily life. Some tasks, like getting dressed or bathing, become hard. But the outlook for treating upper limb spasticity is better than it has ever been. There are many treatments that can make your muscles more flexible and give you better control of your arm movements. If your symptoms improve, you may be able to reduce your treatment. Causes Your muscles move when they get electrical signals from the nerves that branch throughout your body . These signals come from your spinal cord and brain . When your brain or spinal cord is damaged, they don’t send those signals the right way. The uneven signaling causes your muscles to flex, stiffen, and twitch. There are several things that can damage your brain or nervous system and lead to upper limb spasticity. Strokes , which happen when an artery to your brain is blocked by a clot or it bursts. Without the blood and oxygen they need, brain cells can die, creating problems with some of the nerves in your body. Diseases like multiple sclerosis and cerebral palsy , which destroy the nervous system Injuries Symptoms You may not have any symptoms of upper limb spasticity until weeks, months, or even years after you have a stroke or brain injury. The condition can cause: Stiff arm muscles Twitches or movements that you can’t control Trouble using or moving your arms Tightness in the muscles in your elbows, wrists, or fingers Arms that get stuck in uncomfortable positions, such as pressed against your side. Rotated shoulders Bent elbows or wrists Hands clenched into fists Difficulty or pain when you move or straighten your arm, elbows, wrists, or fingers Without treatment, your muscles can seem frozen in these positions. Spasms and stiffness can make it very hard to do normal tasks like dressing yourself. If you notice muscle tightness, spasms, or stiff limbs at any time after you’ve had a stroke or brain injury, you should tell your doctor right away. Getting a Diagnosis You’ll need to see a neurologist, a specialist who treats problems with the brain and nervous system. They’ll give you a physical exam and test your muscle movement to see how well you can control your arms, elbows, wrists, and hands. They’ll flex your joints to see how limber they are. They may ask you to move your arms on your own to see how much control you have. The doctor will also ask you questions about your symptoms, like: Which muscles are having spasms? When did they start? How often do you have them? Does anything make your muscles feel better or worse? Are you having any pain or stiffness? Do you have any trouble doing daily tasks or taking care of yourself? What’s hard for you? Your doctor may also use a test called electromyography , or EMG, to see how well your arm muscles and nerves are working. For this test, you’ll sit or lie down, and a technician will put electrodes on your arms. The electrodes have small needles that go into your muscles, and they’re attached by wires to a machine that can measure the electricity in your muscles and nerves. Your doctor will ask you to slowly flex and relax your arms so the machine can record the activity. They may also inject a drug to briefly numb the area where you have spasms to see if they still happen when you can’t move your muscles. The test can take 30 minutes to an hour. Questions for Your Doctor You’ll want to find out as much as you can about your condition so you can learn how to control it and feel better. You might want to ask: What caused my spasticity? What kinds of treatments are there? Which ones would be best for me? How will the medicines make me feel? Do I need physical therapy? How long will I need treatment? What can I do to make my arms less stiff? Treatment The goal of treatments for upper limb spasticity is to keep your muscles from becoming too stiff and give you more freedom to move your arms. It’s important to get therapy so you can keep moving your muscles and stop them from getting stiffer and more painful. Your doctor will recommend a treatment based on how healthy you are and the symptoms you have. There are several options that may work for you. Exercises, like stretches, may help your joints and muscles become more flexible. A physical therapist can teach them to you. Braces or splints hold your muscles and joints in the right position and keep them from getting too tight. OnabotulinumtoxinA (Botox) and abobotulinumtoxinA ( Dysport ), used for the treatment of upper and lower limb spasticity, can relax muscles and ease spasms. Your doctor can give you a shot of it directly into your muscles. Botox and Dysport have some potentially serious side effects such as breathing and swallowing issues, so make sure to discuss them with your physician. Drugs like baclofen ( Lioresal , Ozobax ), clonazepam ( Klonopin ), diazepam ( Valium ), and tizanidine ( Zanaflex ) also make your muscles more relaxed. Nerve block injections, shots of drugs that numb the nerves that cause muscles to twitch, may stop spasms when other medicines don’t work. Surgery to cut connections between nerves or tendons and muscles that spasm. Your doctor may recommend this if other treatments don’t work. If your condition gets better, you may be able to reduce your treatment. It’s important to stick to your therapy plan and tell your doctor about any changes in how you feel. Taking Care of Yourself Along with treatment, there are things you can do to keep your muscles and joints as flexible as possible. Stay as active as you can. Exercise will loosen your muscles and increase your flexibility. Swimming and strength-building activities may especially help. Play games or sports, or try to do normal household tasks to stay active and move stiff limbs. Get enough sleep . If you’re tired, your symptoms may get worse. Find ways to relax. Stress can make spasticity worse, so find low-key activities that you enjoy. Try reading, taking a walk, or meditation. What to Expect Without treatment, upper limb spasticity can make your muscles stiffer and more painful over time. But new treatments can give you better control of your arms and help you live an active life. Your physical therapist or occupational therapist can help you find ways to increase your flexibility or find new, easier ways to do tasks. Getting Support Find helpful information and support from organizations like the American Stroke Association (ASA). You can find stroke support groups in your area or to join a group online. Call the ASA at 888-478-7653 to be connected to a trained volunteer who can provide support or offer advice."
3,Should You Bank Your Baby’s Cord Blood?,"What Is Cord Blood Banking? Cord blood banking is a process of collecting potentially life-saving stem cells from the umbilical cord and placenta and storing them for future use. Stem cells are immature cells that can assume the form of other cells. There are so many things to think about when you have a child. One of them is the blood from your baby’s umbilical cord (which connects the baby to the mother while in the womb). It used to be thrown away at birth, but now, many parents store the blood for the future health of their child. Should you do it? What Can It Be Used For? The umbilical cord fluid is loaded with stem cells . They can treat cancer , blood diseases like anemia , and some immune system disorders , which disrupt your body's ability to defend itself. The fluid is easy to collect and has 10 times more stem cells than those collected from bone marrow. Stem cells from cord blood rarely carry any infectious diseases and are half as likely to be rejected as adult stem cells. How Do You Get It? If you want the blood stored, after the birth, the doctor clamps the umbilical cord in two places, about 10 inches apart, and cuts the cord, separating mother from baby . Then they insert a needle and collect at least 40 milliliters of blood from the cord. The blood is sealed in a bag and sent to a lab or cord blood bank for testing and storage. The process only takes a few minutes and is painless for mother and baby . The cord blood bank may also send tubes so that the mother’s blood can be taken, too. If so, the banking kit will have instructions along with blood collection tubes. Where Is It stored? There are three options: Public cord banks don't charge anything for storage. Any donation made is available for anyone who needs it. The bank may also use the donated cord blood for research. Private (commercial) cord banks will store the donated blood for use by the donor and family members only. They can be expensive. These banks charge a fee for processing and an annual fee for storage. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) neither recommends nor advises against cord blood banking. But along with the AAP and AMA, it cautions parents about private cord blood banking. Here's why: Collection and storage costs at private cord blood banks are high. Other effective treatments may be available that are less expensive. The chance of privately banked cord blood being used by your child is extremely low. A stem cell transplant using an individual’s own cord blood (called an autologous transplant) cannot be used for genetic disorders such as sickle cell disease and thalassemia, because the genetic mutations that cause these disorders are present in the baby's cord blood. Other diseases that can be treated with a stem cell transplant, such as leukemia, may also already be present in a baby’s cord blood. Because of these limits and the uncommon occurrence of the diseases that can be treated with a stem cell transplant, there have been just more than 400 autologous cord blood transplants in United States in the last 2 decades. In contrast, more than 60,000 unrelated donor cord blood transplants have been performed worldwide. In short, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association recommend against storing cord blood as a form of ""biological insurance,"" because the benefits are too remote to justify the costs. Are there situations where private cord blood banking might make sense? Some parents choose to bank their child's blood if they don't know their medical background -- for instance, if a parent was adopted or the child was conceived with a sperm or egg donor. Direct-donation banks are a combination of public and private banks. They store cord blood for public use. But they also accept donations reserved for families. No fee is charged. Should You Bank Your Baby's Cord Blood? It depends on who you ask. Although commercial cord blood banks often bill their services as ""biological insurance"" against future diseases, the blood doesn’t often get used. One study says the chance that a child will use their cord blood over their lifetime is between 1 in 400 and 1 in 200,000. The stored blood can't always be used, even if the person develops a disease later on, because if the disease was caused by a genetic mutation, it would also be in the stem cells. Current research says the stored blood may be useful for only 15 years. There are other things to consider if you have twins. If one of your twins is born with a genetic disorder or develops a childhood leukemia, the cord blood likely contains the same code that caused the problem in the first place. It cannot be used to treat either twin or any other person. Cord blood cells from one healthy twin can be used to treat your other twin or another ill child, as long as the two are a good match. But this benefit is greatest when the two children have a slightly different genetic makeup. This means that if your twins are identical (monozygotic), they will make poor blood donors for one another. If your twins are fraternal (dizygotic), they have the same chance as any other sibling of making a good donor for the other twin. Regardless of whether twins are identical or fraternal, cord blood could be used to treat another ill sibling. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Academy of Pediatrics don’t recommend routine cord blood storage. The groups say private banks should be used only when there’s a sibling with a medical condition who could benefit from the stem cells. The AAP does recommend cord blood banking if an infant has a full sibling with a malignant or genetic condition treatable with cord blood transplantation. These conditions include: Leukemia Immune deficiencies, such as severe combined immune deficiency (SCID) Lymphoma (Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's) Aplastic anemia Sickle cell anemia Krabbe's disease Thalassemia Other rare diseases Even so, a brother or a sister has only a 25% chance of being a perfect genetic match. Thus, a sibling may require a bone marrow or cord blood transplant from an unrelated donor. The AMA also suggests considering private cord blood banking if there is a family history of malignant or genetic conditions that might benefit from cord blood stem cells. But keep in mind that to find a suitable match for any type of transplant, 70% must look outside their family. Families are encouraged to donate stem cells to a public bank to help others. If you do decide to bank your baby’s cord blood, there’s one more thing to keep in mind: It’s best not to make it a last-minute decision. You should coordinate with the bank before your baby is born so nothing is left to chance. What the Future Holds No one knows how stem cells will be used in the future, but researchers hope they may be used to treat many conditions, like Alzheimer's, diabetes, heart failure, spinal cord damage, and others. It's possible that storing your child's cord blood cells now may be useful one day in combating these diseases. For now, these treatments are only theories. It's also not clear if stem cells from cord blood -- as opposed to stem cells from other sources -- will be useful in these potential treatments."
4,Umbilical Cord Care,"What Is an Umbilical Cord? The umbilical cord is the tube-like structure that carries food and oxygen from a mother to their baby while pregnant . It also carries waste products away from the baby so the mother’s body can get rid of them. After you give birth, doctors clamp and cut the cord. The cord has no nerves, so neither you nor your baby will feel anything. A small stump will be left on your child’s belly. It can be anywhere from a half-inch to an inch long. At first, the stump might look shiny and yellow. But as it dries out, it may turn brown or gray or even purplish or blue. It’ll shrivel and turn black before it falls off on its own. Usually, it comes off between 10 and 14 days after your baby is born, but can take as long as 21 days. Caring for Baby’s Umbilical Cord Stump Here are a few things to keep in mind until the cord comes off: Be gentle. Keep your hands off of it, and don’t ever pull on it. Keep the cord clean and dry at all times. Skip the tub and sink and give your baby sponge baths instead. Leave the cord alone until it falls off by itself. (In the past, doctors suggested cleaning the cord’s base with rubbing alcohol to help it dry out, but that guidance has changed.) Fold diapers so that they rest below the cord to shield it from your little one’s pee. You can look for diapers that have an area cut out for the cord or cut a spot out of a regular diaper. Just place a piece of tape around it to seal the edges. If your baby has a messy bowel movement and some stool gets on the cord, clean it gently with soap and water . Check the cord often for infections. Call your doctor if you see: Blood on the end of the cord A white or yellow discharge Swelling or redness around the cord Signs that the area around the cord causes your baby pain (for example, they cry when you touch it) If your baby had a low birth weight because they were born prematurely or had another health issue, they may be more likely to have an infection, so it’s good to keep an especially close eye out for any of these signs. What Happens When the Stump Comes Off? It’s normal to see a few drops of blood in your baby’s diaper. But if there’s a lot of blood as the cord separates, call your doctor right away. If the cord hasn’t come off after 3 weeks, be patient. Keep the area dry and make sure it’s not covered by your child’s diaper. If it hasn’t come off in 6 weeks, or you see signs of fever or infection, call your doctor. Once the cord is gone, continue to keep the area clean and dry. You might notice a yellow, sticky fluid that oozes out. This is normal. It sometimes happens when the cord comes off. It’s not pus, and it’s not an infection. You might also see a scab over the navel. This is normal, too. But if your baby’s stomach gets red, they run a fever , or you notice a cloudy discharge, call your doctor. Sometimes, a little scar tissue may form a red mass on the belly button. This bump is called an umbilical granuloma. If you see this and it doesn’t go away in about a week, let your doctor know. They’ll apply silver nitrate to it. It’ll burn the area so the tissue dries up. But remember, the cord has no nerves, so your baby won’t feel it. At some point, you’ll probably wonder what kind of belly button your child will have. Will it be an “innie” or an “outie”? You’ll have to wait until the stump is gone to know for sure. But know that the way your baby’s navel will look has nothing to do with how the doctor cut the umbilical cord. Umbilical Cord Complications They don’t happen often, but some health conditions are linked to the umbilical cord stump, including: Omphalitis: This is when the area around the stump of the umbilical cord gets infected. Symptoms can include tenderness, bleeding or fluid leaking from the navel, irritability, and fever. It needs treatment with antibiotics. Umbilical hernia: With this condition, part of the baby’s intestine pokes through the muscles near their belly button. It’s not usually serious and typically gets better on its own by age 2. Umbilical granuloma: This is a small, pinkish-red lump that doesn’t fall off when the rest of the umbilical cord does. It doesn’t hurt, and your baby’s doctor can remove it by tying it off with stitches or freezing it with liquid nitrogen."
5,Umbilical Hernia,"What Are Umbilical Hernias? Umbilical hernias are swollen bumps that appear when part of your intestines stick out through your abdominal muscles near your navel. If your baby has a bulge around the bellybutton, they may have an umbilical hernia. Before the umbilical cord falls off, you may notice that the area seems to stick out a little more when the baby cries. Or maybe, once the cord is gone, you see that their navel sticks out (an “outie,” as it’s commonly called). In some cases, even if you can’t see a bulge, you might be able to feel one. Umbilical Hernia Causes While you’re pregnant , the umbilical cord is connected to your baby ’s abdominal muscles through a small hole. This usually closes up after the baby’s born. When it doesn’t, the gap that’s left is called an umbilical hernia. If intestines and fluid poke through it, they cause the belly to bulge or swell. Forget what you may have heard: The way the doctor cuts or clamps the cord when your child is born doesn’t affect whether an umbilical hernia will form or not. It’s less common, but adults can also get umbilical hernias. Adult umbilical hernias often happen over time when abdominal pressure goes up. You might have this because of: Chronic cough Extra belly fluid Problems urinating because of a large prostate Constipation Obesity Straining in childbirth or weightlifting Umbilical Hernia Symptoms You’ll be able to see the hernia most clearly when your child cries, coughs, or strains while trying to poop. That’s because all of these things put pressure on the abdomen . When your child rests, you might not be able to see the hernia. Usually, they don’t hurt. Your child’s doctor can tell if there’s a hernia during a physical exam . You’ll want to keep a close eye on your child’s hernia for signs that the intestine has been trapped in the hole and can’t go back in. Doctors call this an incarcerated hernia. Symptoms include: Pain around the bellybutton area Swelling in the area Discoloration of the bellybutton area Vomiting If you notice any of these symptoms, take your baby to the emergency room. Umbilical Hernia Diagnosis In order to see if you’re dealing with an umbilical hernia, your doctor will feel and look at the area. They’ll also ask you for your symptom history. Your doctor may try to see if they can push the bulge of the hernia back into your abdomen. Sometimes a doctor may suggest you get a CT scan to check for complications. Umbilical Hernia Treatment Most umbilical hernias don’t need any treatment. Usually, the hole heals on its own by the time your child is 4 or 5 years old. Even if it doesn’t, it’ll likely get smaller. That’ll make surgery a bit easier. You might think it looks like your child needs to have an operation, but their doctor might suggest you wait to see if the problem goes away on its own. If the hole is large, they may recommend surgery before your child turns 4 or 5. Your doctor may also suggest surgery if the hernia is: Painful Larger than ½ to ¾ inch Large and doesn’t get smaller in the first 2 years of life Gets trapped or blocks intestines The procedure is done in a hospital or outpatient surgery center. It takes about 45 minutes, and your child will be given anesthesia and won’t be awake. The surgeon will make a small cut just below the bellybutton. If any part of the intestine pokes through, it will be put back where it belongs. The doctor will use stitches to close the hernia. They’ll also sew the skin under the navel to give it an “innie” look. Then, the cut will be sealed with surgical glue that’ll hold the edges of the wound together. It’ll come off by itself once the site heals. After the procedure, your child will stay at the hospital while they recover from the anesthesia. Most kids can go home a few hours later. After Surgery An over-the-counter pain medication may help your little one feel better after the operation. Your doctor will want a follow-up visit in 2 to 4 weeks. Call your doctor right away if your child has: A fever Redness, swelling, or pain A bulge near the navel Blood or smelly fluid near the cut Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea , or constipation that doesn’t get better Umbilical Hernia Complications Complications from umbilical hernias aren’t common. If the hernia becomes incarcerated, the tissue can begin to die or cause pain . This is a serious complication that can cause infection in the abdominal cavity and even death. Adults are more likely to have an intestinal blockage as a complication of a trapped hernia. If you have a blockage, you’ll need emergency surgery. Umbilical Hernia Outlook Most umbilical hernias in babies go away on their own by the time your child is 2. If you have surgery to repair your umbilical hernia, your recovery time will depend on its size and how difficult your surgery was. Both children and adults who have surgery typically go home the same day of the procedure. Usually you’ll need about 3 to 5 days to rest and heal. You shouldn’t lift anything heavy for about 3 weeks after surgery. Once your umbilical hernia goes away, either on its own or with surgery, it’s not likely it will come back."
6,How to Care for Your Baby Boy’s Penis,"If it’s your first time caring for a baby boy, you might feel a bit unsure about the right way to care for their genitals. But don’t worry -- it’s pretty straightforward. Here’s everything you need to know to keep the area clean and healthy. If They Are Circumcised If your son was circumcised, that means the loose skin covering the head of their penis was removed and the tip exposed. After the procedure, their care team covered their penis with petroleum jelly and wrapped it in gauze. Keep a covering on the area for the 48 hours following the procedure. For the first couple of days after the surgery, your doctor may recommend keeping the area covered with a glob of petroleum jelly on a square gauze pad. Change the pad after poopy diapers to prevent an infection. After a couple of days, once the area starts to heal, you can stop using the gauze and just put some petroleum jelly on the tip. This will keep their healing penis from sticking to their diaper. Change their diaper often, and use a mild soap and water to clean off any poop that gets on their penis . It’s normal for the tip of the penis to look red and appear to have a crusty white or yellow coating. That helps the area heal -- don’t wipe it off. Once the penis is healed, usually after 7-10 days, you can wash it with soap and water. Problems are rare, but let your doctor know if: Your baby doesn’t pee within 6-8 hours after the circumcision The bleeding doesn’t stop Redness gets worse after a few days You notice swelling, crusted yellow sores or discharge from the penis. Usually once the circumcision is healed, you don’t need to do anything special. Just keep the area clean and dry so your son stays healthy and comfortable. If They Are Uncircumcised If your baby wasn't circumcised, meaning you chose not to remove the skin at the head of their penis, you don’t have to do any special cleaning. Just wipe the area during diaper changes and rinse with warm, soapy water at bath time. The pediatrician will advise when to start gently pulling back the foreskin to clean under it. At this age, it’s fused to the head of the penis, and forcing it back can cause pain or bleeding. Your doctor will let you know when the skin has separated, which won’t happen until they are 3-5 years old. At that point, the foreskin will easily move back and forth, and you can teach your son to regularly wash the area underneath."
7,Gilbert Syndrome,"What Is Gilbert’s Syndrome? Gilbert’s syndrome (also called constitutional hepatic dysfunction or familial nonhemolytic jaundice) is a common disorder that's passed through families. When you have it, too much of a waste product called bilirubin builds up in your blood . It can make your skin and eyes look yellow from time to time. Gilbert’s syndrome looks scarier than it is. It's a harmless condition that doesn't need to be treated. Gilbert’s Syndrome Causes and Risk Factors It happens when a gene called UGT1A1 changes, or mutates. This gene carries instructions for making a liver enzyme that helps break down and get rid of the bilirubin in your body. Parents pass UGT1A1 gene mutations to their children. You need two copies of the mutated gene -- one from each parent -- to get it. Even if you do have both genes, you might not have Gilbert’s syndrome. Gilbert’s syndrome is more common in men than in women. Gilbert’s Syndrome Symptoms Most people with Gilbert’s syndrome don't have symptoms. They have enough of the liver enzyme to control their bilirubin levels. When bilirubin does build up in the blood , it causes the skin and whites of the eyes to turn yellow. This is called jaundice . See your doctor if you notice a yellow color to your skin and eyes because another condition could be causing it. Jaundice can cause other symptoms such as: Nausea and diarrhea Abdominal discomfort Fatigue Dark urine Jaundice is a common problem in babies. But it’s worse in babies born with Gilbert’s syndrome. Certain things can make your bilirubin levels rise, but you might only notice jaundice when you: Are stressed Are dehydrated Exercise too much Have an infection like the flu Skip meals Drink alcohol Take medicines that affect your liver Are outside in cold weather Have your period Are recovering from surgery Gilbert’s Syndrome Diagnosis Although people are born with Gilbert’s syndrome, sometimes they don’t get diagnosed until their 20s or 30s. You may have a blood test for another reason and your doctor may notice you have high bilirubin levels, which may be a clue that you have the syndrome. They may do more tests to diagnose you, including: A liver ultrasound or liver function tests to rule out other problems Gene tests to see if you have the UGT1A1 gene mutation A liver biopsy (rarely done) Gilbert’s Syndrome Treatments and Home Remedies Most people with Gilbert’s syndrome don't need treatment. Jaundice doesn't cause any long-term problems. To prevent it, try to avoid things that make your bilirubin levels rise. For instance: Don't skip meals. Drink plenty of fluids. Use relaxation techniques or other methods to manage stress . Get a good night's sleep . Limit your alcoholic drinks. Skip long and strenuous workouts. The same liver enzyme that breaks down bilirubin also breaks down certain medicines, including: Acetaminophen Irinotecan ( Camptosar ), a cancer drug Protease inhibitor drugs used to treat HIV and hepatitis C Monoclonal antibodies used to treat autoimmune diseases If you have Gilbert’s syndrome and you take any of these drugs, you're at higher risk for side effects like diarrhea . Ask your doctor before you take any new medicine. And don't take more than the recommended dose."
8,Hypothyroidism (Underactive Thyroid),"What Is Hypothyroidism? Hypothyroidism, also called underactive thyroid disease, is a common disorder. With hypothyroidism, your thyroid gland does not make enough thyroid hormone. The thyroid gland is located in the front lower part of your neck. Hormones released by the gland travel through your bloodstream and affect nearly every part of your body, from your heart and brain , to your muscles and skin . The thyroid controls how your body's cells use energy from food, a process called metabolism. Among other things, your metabolism affects your body’s temperature, your heartbeat, and how well you burn calories. If you don't have enough thyroid hormone, your body processes slow down. That means your body makes less energy, and your metabolism becomes sluggish. Symptoms of Hypothyroidism Symptoms of hypothyroidism may be vague and can often mimic other conditions. They may include: Changes in the menstrual cycle Constipation Depression Dry hair and hair loss Dry skin Elevated cholesterol Fatigue Greater sensitivity to cold Hoarse voice Joint pain , stiffness, and swelling Problems with memory Muscle aches and stiffness Muscle weakness Puffy face Slow heart rate Swelling of the thyroid gland ( goiter ) Unexplained weight gain or difficulty losing weight Carpal tunnel syndrome Babies with hypothyroidism may have no symptoms. If symptoms do occur, they can include: Cold hands and feet Constipation Extreme sleepiness Hoarse cry Little or no growth Low muscle tone (floppy infant) Persistent jaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes) Poor feeding habits Puffy face Stomach bloating Swollen tongue Umbilical hernia Make an appointment with your health care provider if you or your baby has any of these symptoms. It’s important to note that these symptoms can be due to other medical conditions. Children and teens may also have hypothyroidism with the signs and symptoms seen in adults. Kids and teens may also have: Delays in puberty Delays in growth and shorter stature Slow mental development Slower development of permanent teeth Causes of Hypothyroidism The most common cause of hypothyroidism is Hashimoto's thyroiditis . ""Thyroiditis"" is an inflammation of the thyroid gland. Hashimoto's thyroiditis is an autoimmune disorder. With Hashimoto’s, your body produces antibodies that attack and destroy the thyroid gland. Thyroiditis may also be caused by a viral infection. Other causes of hypothyroidism include: Radiation therapy to the neck area. Treating certain cancers, such as lymphoma, requires radiation to the neck. Radiation damages the cells in the thyroid. This makes it more difficult for the gland to produce hormones. Radioactive iodine treatment. This treatment is commonly prescribed to people who have an overactive thyroid gland, a condition known as hyperthyroidism . However, radiation destroys the cells in the thyroid gland. This usually leads to hypothyroidism. Use of certain medications. Certain medicines to treat heart problems, psychiatric conditions, and cancer can sometimes affect the production of thyroid hormone. These include amiodarone (Cordarone, Pacerone), interferon alpha, and interleukin-2. Thyroid surgery. Surgery to remove the thyroid will lead to hypothyroidism. If only part of the thyroid is removed, the remaining gland may still be able to produce enough hormone for the body's needs. Too little iodine in the diet. The thyroid needs iodine to produce thyroid hormone. Your body doesn't make iodine, so you need to get it through your diet. Iodized table salt is rich in iodine. Other food sources of iodine include shellfish, saltwater fish, eggs, dairy products, and seaweed. Iodine deficiency is rare in the U.S. Pregnancy . The reason isn’t clear, but sometimes, inflammation of the thyroid occurs after pregnancy . This is called postpartum thyroiditis. Women with this condition usually have a severe increase in thyroid hormone levels followed by a sharp drop in thyroid hormone production. Most women with postpartum thyroiditis will regain their normal thyroid function. Problems with the thyroid at birth. Some babies may be born with a thyroid gland that did not develop correctly or does not work properly. This type of hypothyroidism is called congenital hypothyroidism. Most hospitals in the U.S. screen babies at birth for this disease. Pituitary gland damage or disorder. Rarely, a problem with the pituitary gland can interfere with the production of thyroid hormone. The pituitary gland makes a hormone, called thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), which tells your thyroid how much hormone it should make and release . Disorder of the hypothalamus. An extremely rare form of hypothyroidism can occur if the hypothalamus in the brain does not produce enough of a hormone called TRH. TRH affects the release of TSH from the pituitary gland. Primary hypothyroidism is caused by a problem with the thyroid gland itself. Secondary hypothyroidism occurs when another problem interferes with the thyroid's ability to produce hormones. For example, the pituitary gland or hypothalamus produce hormones that trigger the release of thyroid hormone. A problem with one of these glands can make your thyroid underactive. Sometimes, an underactive thyroid that results from a problem with the hypothalamus is called tertiary hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism Risk Factors Women, particularly older women, are more likely to develop hypothyroidism than men. You are also more likely to develop hypothyroidism if you have a close family member with an autoimmune disease . Other risk factors include: Race (being white or Asian) Age (growing older) Prematurely graying hair Autoimmune disorders such as type 1 diabetes , multiple sclerosis , rheumatoid arthritis , celiac disease , Addison's disease , pernicious anemia , or vitiligo Bipolar disorder Down syndrome Turner syndrome Diagnosis of Hypothyroidism If you have symptoms of hypothyroidism, your doctor will order blood tests to check hormone levels. These may include: Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) T4 ( thyroxine ) Lower-than-normal T4 levels usually mean you have hypothyroidism. However, some people may have increased TSH levels while having normal T4 levels. This is called subclinical (mild) hypothyroidism. It is believed to be an early stage of hypothyroidism. If your test results or physical exam of the thyroid are abnormal, your doctor may order a thyroid ultrasound , or thyroid scan, to check for nodules or inflammation. Hypothyroidism Treatment If you have hypothyroidism, your doctor will prescribe a synthetic (human-made) thyroid hormone T4. You take this pill every day. Certain other medications can interfere with how your body absorbs synthetic thyroid hormone. Make sure your doctor knows about all the medicines, herbs, and supplements you take, including over-the-counter products. You will need regular blood tests to check your thyroid hormone levels. Your doctor may need to adjust your medication dose from time to time. It may take a little time to figure out the correct dosage of thyroid hormone that you need. Your doctor will give you a blood test to check your TSH levels 6 to 8 weeks after you start taking synthetic hormones, and then once every 6 months. If your dosage is too high and you get too much hormone, you could have these side effects: Appetite increases Can’t sleep Heart palpitations Shakiness People with severe hypothyroidism or heart disease may start out with a low dose of synthetic hormone, and then gradually increase the amount so their heart can adjust to it. Once you have the correct dosage, you shouldn’t have any side effects from your hormones. But don’t stop or skip your medication, because your hypothyroidism symptoms could come back. If you gain or lose even as much as 10 pounds of body weight, you may need to get your TSH levels checked again to see if your hormone dosage should be adjusted. Complications of Hypothyroidism Untreated, hypothyroidism may cause complications, such as: Balance problems. Older women are at extra risk for balance problems if their thyroid hormone levels are too low. Goiter. If your thyroid is always trying to produce more hormones, the gland can swell and change the appearance of your neck. You may also have trouble swallowing. Heart problems. Hypothyroidism puts you at greater risk for heart disease and can raise your levels of LDL or “bad” cholesterol. Infertility . Too little thyroid hormone may disrupt your production of eggs (ovulation) and make it harder to conceive. Joint pain. Low levels of thyroid hormone can cause you to have aches and pains in your joints and muscles, as well as tendonitis. Mental health issues. Low thyroid hormones can cause memory or concentration lapses, as well as decreased interest in activities you used to enjoy. See your doctor if you notice these changes, as they could also be due to depression unrelated to your thyroid. Obesity. Although hypothyroidism may curb your appetite, you can gain weight because your metabolism slows down too, and you don’t burn enough calories. Peripheral neuropathy. Over time, low thyroid hormones can damage your peripheral nerves. You may notice pain, tingling, or numbness in your limbs. Thyroid problems in a pregnant woman can affect the developing baby. During the first three months of pregnancy, the baby receives all thyroid hormone from its mother. If the mother has hypothyroidism, the baby does not get enough thyroid hormone. This can lead to problems with mental development. Extremely low levels of thyroid hormone can cause a life-threatening condition called myxedema. Myxedema is the most severe form of hypothyroidism. A person with myxedema can lose consciousness or go into a coma. The condition can also cause the body temperature to drop very low, which can cause death."
9,Lab Test Results: What to Expect,"If you’re waiting for lab test results to come back or you’re trying to figure out what they mean, the process and all those medical terms and numbers can be confusing. There are thousands of lab tests, and their results can mean different things. But a few general guidelines can help shed some light. How do doctors use lab tests? Nobody likes to get poked with a needle or pee in a cup. But lab tests are important tools, and doctors use them in a few different ways: To check on how you’re doing generally, like cholesterol or blood sugar tests when you have a physical To answer a specific question, like “Do you have strep throat ?” To track an ongoing condition or see how treatment is working How long does it take to get results? That depends on the test. Some can be done right in the office or a nearby lab, so you may have the results that day or the next. Other tests may take days or weeks, especially if they have to be sent to a specific kind of lab. Before you leave your doctor’s office, ask when you’ll know the results. And ask the office staff to let you know when they’re in. (Some offices might not call if you don’t request it, especially if the results are in the normal range. Some offices also have options to allow access to your lab results on patient portals) What do my results mean? Here are a few things to look for: Positive vs. Negative. Some lab tests answer yes-or-no questions like whether you’re pregnant or have certain kinds of infections. These results are usually written as “positive” or “negative.” In this case, positive doesn’t necessarily mean “good” and negative doesn’t necessarily mean “bad.” Instead: Positive: The lab found whatever your doctor was testing for. So if you had a test for strep throat, testing positive means you do have strep throat. Negative: The lab didn’t find whatever you were tested for. A negative result for strep throat means that the lab didn’t find any strep bacteria in the sample, so you probably don’t have it. Sometimes, the result might be “inconclusive.” That means the lab doesn’t have a clear yes or no answer based on your sample. Your doctor may want you to do the test again or have another kind of test. Reference Ranges. A lot of lab test results don’t give clear answers. Instead, they’re shown as a number -- like your cholesterol levels . These numbers don’t mean anything on their own, so you have to see how yours compare to a healthy range called your “reference range” or “reference value.” You’ll see this range on the lab test results. Are lab test results always right? While they do have to meet very high standards, they can be wrong sometimes. For example, you might get a false positive (the results say you have the condition you were tested for, but you really don’t) or a false negative (the results say you don’t have a condition, but you really do). Lots of things can affect certain lab test results, like: Fasting vs nonfasting Being well hydrated vs dehydrated Medications Intense physical activity Some foods (like avocados , walnuts, and licorice) Sunburn Colds or infections Having sex Some medications or drugs When you get your results, ask your doctor how accurate the test is. If your doctor thinks your results may not be right, they may recommend that you do the test again or take a different test. What if my lab results aren’t “normal”? It’s easy to be concerned if you see words like “abnormal” on your results. But that’s not all that unusual. For example, if your results are just outside the reference range, it may not necessarily be a problem. If you’re worried about any of your results or have any questions, call your doctor’s office. You can talk to a nurse or schedule an appointment with your doctor to talk about them. They can help you understand what your results mean for you. Lab Test Tips Always keep a copy of your results. This can be useful in case you switch doctors, need to show them to a specialist, or just want to look at them again later. Remind your doctor if you take medications or have a health condition that can affect your results. That should be in your record, but it’s still a good idea to mention it. Be honest if you didn’t follow the instructions. With some lab tests, you’re supposed to fast (not eat), or not do certain activities, eat certain foods, or take certain drugs. If you forget and mess up, don’t worry -- just tell your doctor before you do the test. It’s not a big deal to reschedule, and it’s a waste of time to get the test if the results won’t be right. Make sure your doctor always uses the same lab to do your tests if possible. It can be hard to compare results from different labs because they may approach the test differently. For example, one lab might have different ranges for “normal” and “abnormal” than another. Ask your doctor questions about your results like: Why did I need this test? What exactly does this test result mean? How accurate is this test? When will I need to do this test again? Based on my results, do I need treatment or other tests?"
10,What Is an Undescended Testicle?,"In the last few months of a pregnancy , a baby goes through all kinds of changes. The eyes open wide, the bones fully form, and weight gain ramps up. For boys, it’s also when the testicles move from the lower belly to the scrotum, that pouch of skin below the penis . But sometimes, one or both testicles don’t fall into place. That’s called an undescended testicle. It can happen to any baby boy, but it’s more common for those born earlier than expected. More often than not, the testicle drops into the scrotum on its own by the time the baby is 6 months old. If it doesn’t, the child will likely need surgery. What Causes It? Doctors aren’t sure why it happens. They think it’s related to genes, the mother’s health, and outside influences that change how hormones and nerves normally work. Even though the cause isn’t clear, certain factors might make an undescended testicle more likely: An earlier-than-expected birth Family history of them or other problems with how genitals develop Health conditions, such as Down syndrome , that affect how a fetus grows Low birth weight Contact by the parents with certain chemicals (pesticides) that kill bugs -- these are often used on farms It may also be more likely if the mother: Has diabetes (type 1, type 2, or gestational) Is obese Smoked cigarettes or drank alcohol during pregnancy How Do I Know There’s a Problem? The main sign: You can’t see or feel the testicle in the scrotum. When both are undescended, the scrotum looks flat and smaller than you’d expect it to be. Some boys have what’s called a retractile testicle. It may move up into their groin when they are cold or scared but moves back down on its own. It’s generally not a problem. The difference is that an undescended testicle stays up -- it doesn’t move back and forth. Diagnosis In most cases, your doctor finds the problem as part of a regular check-up soon after birth. If your doctor thinks there’s a problem, they may try to rule out other causes, such as: Ectopic testicles. This is a similar condition where the testicles don’t fall into place. Your doctor can check for this as part of a physical exam . Retractile testicles. Your doctor will see if they can gently move the testicle into the scrotum with their hand . If they can do that, then it’s a retractile testicle. What Problems Can It Cause? An undescended testicle is related to a number of conditions: Fertility problems. Because sperm need to be a little cooler than the rest of the body, an undescended testicle can cause fertility issues. This is more of a problem when both are lodged in the groin. Early treatment can make a big difference. Hernia . This is a condition where part of the intestine bulges through the muscles of the lower belly. Injury. When the testicle is out of place, it’s more likely to be damaged. Cancer . Men who have an undescended testicle are a little more likely to get testicular cancer , even if they have surgery to treat it. But surgery makes routine self-exams possible, so if cancer does appear, it can be found early. Testicular torsion . This is when the cord that carries semen to the penis gets twisted up. It’s painful and can cut off blood flow to the testicle. Treatment Very often, the testicle moves into place within a few months. At first, you’ll want to wait and see how things go with regular check-ups. If it doesn’t drop into the scrotum by 6 months, your doctor will likely suggest surgery. Surgery is the most common treatment, and it almost always works. It’s usually done when the baby is 6-12 months old to get the most benefit. Early treatment can lower the chances that your boy will have problems with fertility later in life. Your baby gets medication so they won’t be awake or feel pain during the procedure. The doctor will: Make a small opening in either the groin or lower belly to find the testicle. Gently move the testicle down. Make a small cut in the scrotum and stitch the testicle into place. Close the openings with stitches that dissolve on their own. Unless there are complications, your baby will go home the same day. Your doctor will likely suggest pain medicine for the first couple of days. You’ll need to keep the area dry and have your child avoid things that might irritate it, like ride-on toys. An undescended testicle can also be treated with hormones. This isn’t the typical treatment though. It usually doesn’t work as well as surgery, and there may be side effects."
11,Angina (Ischemic Chest Pain),"What Is Angina? Angina is chest pain that happens because there isn't enough blood going to part of your heart. It can feel like a heart attack, with pressure or squeezing in your chest. It's sometimes called angina pectoris or ischemic chest pain. It's a symptom of heart disease, and it happens when something blocks your arteries or there's not enough blood flow in the arteries that bring oxygen-rich blood to your heart. With angina, pain in your chest can spread to your shoulders, arms, neck, throat, jaw, or back. (Image credit: Rob3000 / Dreamstime) Angina usually goes away quickly. Still, it can be a sign of a life-threatening heart problem. It's important to find out what's going on and what you can do to avoid a heart attack. Usually, medicine and lifestyle changes can control angina. If it's more serious, you may need surgery. Or you may need what's called a stent, a tiny tube that props open arteries. Angina vs. heart attack Heart disease can also cause a heart attack. The decrease in blood flow to your heart in a heart attack is longer than that in angina. This causes part of the heart muscle to die, which is permanent damage. The drop in blood flow to your heart in angina is short. So it doesn't cause permanent damage. Angina Types There are different types of angina: Stable angina This is the most common type of angina. Physical activity or stress can trigger it. It usually lasts a few minutes, and it goes away when you rest. It isn't a heart attack, but it can be a sign that you're more likely to have one. Tell your doctor if this happens to you. Unstable angina You can have unstable angina while you're at rest or not very active. The pain can be strong and long-lasting, and it may come back again and again. It can be a signal that you're about to have a heart attack , so see a doctor right away. Microvascular angina With microvascular angina, you have chest pain but no coronary artery blockage. Instead, it happens because your smallest coronary arteries aren't working the way they should, so your heart doesn't get the blood it needs. The chest pain usually lasts more than 10 minutes. This type is more common in women. Prinzmetal's angina (variant angina) This type of angina is rare. It might happen at night while you're sleeping or resting. Your heart arteries suddenly tighten or narrow. It can cause a lot of pain , and you should get it treated. Angina Symptoms Chest pain is the symptom, but it affects people differently. You may have: Aching Burning Discomfort Dizziness Fatigue Feeling of fullness in your chest Feeling of heaviness or pressure Upset stomach or vomiting Shortness of breath Squeezing Sweating You might mistake an aching or burning for heartburn or gas . You're likely to have pain behind your breastbone, which can spread to your shoulders, arms, neck, throat, jaw, or back. Stable angina often gets better with rest. Unstable angina may not, and it could get worse. It's an emergency that needs medical help right away. Angina symptoms by sex Men often feel pain in their chest, neck, and shoulders. Women may feel discomfort in their belly, neck, jaw, throat, or back. You may also have shortness of breath, sweating, or dizziness. One study found that women were more likely to use the words ""pressing"" or ""crushing"" to describe the feeling. Heart Attack Symptoms You get a heart attack when blood flow to your heart muscle gets restricted or blocked, often by a clot in an artery . Without oxygen, your heart muscle gets damaged or could even die. A 2008 study in the American Journal of Critical Care found that chest pain is the most frequently reported heart attack symptom, and 61% of 256 participants said their symptoms were constant. Your chest pain may feel like: Discomfort Pressure Tightness Burning Fullness Squeezing ""If you've not experienced it before, patients often aren't sure what it is when it first comes on,"" says Kristin Newby, MD, a cardiologist at the Duke Heart Center in Durham, NC. The same study found that women were about 8 years older than men when they began to have heart trouble and were more likely to report a higher intensity of five other symptoms: Indigestion Palpitations Nausea Numbness in the hands Unusual and overwhelming fatigue The study found that 21% of women and 10% of men had no symptoms. Less typical symptoms for both men and women are: Discomfort in the neck, arms, jaw, back, or stomach Shortness of breath Dizziness Cold sweat ""Men and women may respond differently to the symptoms of a heart attack, particularly if the symptoms are vague. But if you have symptoms consistent with a heart attack, don't wait at home. Go to the hospital,"" says Alfred Sacchetti, MD, an emergency room doctor. Angina Causes Angina usually happens because of heart disease. A fatty substance called plaque builds up in your arteries, blocking blood flow to your heart muscle. This forces your heart to work with less oxygen, which causes pain. You may also have blood clots in the arteries of your heart, which can cause heart attacks. Less common causes of chest pain include: A blockage in a major artery of your lungs (pulmonary embolism) An enlarged or thickened heart (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy) Narrowing of a valve in the main part of your heart ( aortic stenosis ) Swelling of the sac around your heart (pericarditis) Tearing in the wall of your aorta, the largest artery in your body (aortic dissection) Angina Risk Factors Some things about you or your lifestyle could put you at a higher risk of angina, including: Older age Family history of heart disease High blood pressure High cholesterol Diabetes Obesity Stress Smoking Not getting enough exercise Angina Diagnosis Your doctor will do a physical exam and ask about your symptoms, risk factors, and family history. They might need to do tests including: EKG. This test measures your heart's electrical activity and rhythm. Stress test. This checks how your heart is working while you exercise. Blood tests. Your doctor will check for proteins called troponins . Lots of them are released when your heart muscle is damaged, as in a heart attack. Your doctor may also do more general tests like a metabolic panel or complete blood count. Imaging tests. Chest X-rays can rule out other things that might be causing your chest pain, like lung conditions. Echocardiograms and CT and MRI scans can create images of your heart to help your doctor spot problems. Cardiac catheterization. Your doctor inserts a long, thin tube into an artery in your leg and threads it up to your heart to check your blood flow and pressure. Coronary angiography. Your doctor injects dye into the blood vessels of your heart. The dye shows up on an X-ray , creating an image of your blood vessels. They may do this procedure during cardiac catheterization. Angina questions for your doctor Do I need any more tests? What type of angina do I have? Do I have heart damage? What treatment do you recommend? How will it make me feel? What can I do to try to prevent a heart attack? Are there activities I shouldn't do? Will changing my diet help? Angina Treatment Your treatment depends on how much damage there is to your heart. For people with mild angina, medicine and lifestyle changes can often help their blood flow better and control their symptoms. Medicines Your doctor might prescribe medicines including: Nitrates or calcium channel blockers to relax and widen blood vessels, letting more blood flow to your heart Beta-blockers to slow your heart down so it doesn't have to work as hard Blood thinners or antiplatelet medications to prevent blood clots Statins to lower your cholesterol levels and stabilize plaque Cardiac procedures If meds aren't enough, you may need to have blocked arteries opened with a medical procedure or surgery. This could be: Angioplasty/stenting. The doctor threads a tiny tube, with a balloon inside, through a blood vessel and up to your heart. Then, they inflate the balloon inside the narrowed artery to widen it and restore blood flow. They may insert a small tube called a stent inside your artery to help keep it open. The stent is permanent and usually made of metal. It can also be made of a material that your body absorbs over time. Some stents also have medicine that helps keep your artery from getting blocked again. The procedure usually takes less than 2 hours. You'll probably stay overnight at the hospital. Coronary artery bypass grafting or bypass surgery. Your surgeon takes healthy arteries or veins from another part of your body and uses them to go around the blocked or narrowed blood vessels. You can expect to stay in the hospital for about a week after you have this. You'll be in the intensive care unit for 1 or 2 days while nurses and doctors keep a close eye on your heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen levels. You'll then move to a regular room to recover. Enhanced external counterpulsation (EECP) EECP may be an option to relieve your angina. Your doctor may recommend it if other treatments haven't worked or aren't right for you. EECP uses several blood pressure cuffs on both legs to gently, but firmly, compress the blood vessels there to boost blood flow to your heart. Each wave is timed to your heartbeat. So more blood goes there when it's relaxing. When your heart pumps again, pressure is released right away. This lets blood to be pumped more easily. It can help your blood vessels make a natural bypass around narrowed or blocked arteries that cause your chest pain. It may help some small blood vessels in your heart open. They may give more blood flow to your heart muscle to help ease your chest pain. You might have EECP if you: Have chronic stable chest pain Aren't helped by nitrates, calcium channel blockers, and beta-blockers Invasive procedures like bypass surgery, angioplasty, or stenting aren't right for you EECP isn't invasive. If you're accepted for EECP treatment, you'll have 35 hours of therapy. It's given 1-2 hours a day, 5 days a week, for 7 weeks. Studies show its benefits include less need for angina medicine, fewer symptoms, and the ability to be more active without symptoms. Angina Outlook Angina raises your risk of having a heart attack. But it's treatable. Consider it a warning sign and make healthy choices. Talk with others who have it. This may help you learn how to feel better. Your family, too, may need support to help them understand your angina . They'll want to know what they can do to help. Lifestyle changes You can still be active, but it's important to listen to your body. If you feel pain, stop what you're doing and rest. Know what triggers your angina, like stress or intense exercise. Try to avoid things that tend to set it off. For example, if large meals cause problems, eat smaller ones and eat more often. If you still feel pain, talk to your doctor about having more tests or changing your medications. Because angina can be a sign of something dangerous, it's important to get checked out. These lifestyle tips may help protect your heart: If you smoke, stop because it can damage your blood vessels and increase your heart disease risk. Eat a heart-healthy diet to lower your blood pressure and cholesterol levels. When those are out of normal range, your chance for heart disease can rise. Eat mainly fruits and vegetables, whole grains, fish, lean meat, and fat-free or low-fat dairy. Limit salt, fat, and sugar. Do things to cut down on stress like meditation, deep breathing, or yoga to relax. Exercise most days of the week. See your doctor regularly . If you have chest pain that is new or unusual for you and you think you may be having a heart attack, call 911 right away. Quick treatment is very important. It can protect you from more damage. Takeaways Angina is chest pain that happens when the flow of blood to your heart briefly decreases. Angina does not cause permanent damage to your heart like a heart attack does. It can be treated with medication or medical procedures like having a stent or a tiny balloon to help open the arteries. Sometimes, coronary bypass surgery is needed. Getting exercise, eating a nutritious diet, and watching your stress level are among the things you can do that can help keep your heart healthier. Angina FAQs Does angina mean a heart attack? Angina means chest pain. It can sometimes signal a heart attack. Angina can be a sign of very serious heart issues. When you have chest pain, it's important to see a doctor right away. How can I remove gas trapped in my chest? Gas can get trapped in your digestive system if you can't burp it out or pass it out. Sometimes, if it's in the upper part of your digestive tract, it can make your chest hurt. You need to find out the source of any of chest pain you may have. If you're having other symptoms that might mean you're having a heart attack or angina (see above), get medical help right away. Chest pain from gas can come after you eat or drink something that causes the gas to form. Burping or passing the gas is the fastest way to get rid of it, but if it's trapped, you might try: A heating pad to help relax your belly area Over-the-counter anti-gas medicine with simethicone Ginger—in tea, candied, or even ginger powder in water Gently rubbing your belly Easy exercise, like walking or yoga poses"
12,Kneecap Problems and Treatments,"Your knee is the largest joint in your body. The kneecap, or patella, is the bone that covers your knee. It helps give the joint strength and structure, which allows your legs to bend and turn safely. Because your knee has many working parts and carries a heavy load, it’s prone to problems. If you have any of these issues with your kneecap, see your doctor so you can figure out the right treatment. Some of them can get better with physical therapy, while others may need surgery. Dislocation Your kneecap can get knocked out of place, or dislocated, when your leg is planted and you suddenly change direction. It can also happen when something hits your leg and forces it in another direction. Signs that you’ve dislocated your kneecap include: The joint looks out of place, though it might move back on its own A popping sound or feeling Severe pain You can’t straighten your leg or walk Sudden swelling Patellar Instability and Dislocation Your knee also might dislocate without an injury because there’s a problem with the structure. That’s called patellar instability. It’s most common in children and teens , though it can happen in adults, too. Structural issues might include: The kneecap rests in a notch at the end of the thigh bone called the trochlear groove. If that notch is very shallow or uneven, it’s easier for the patella to slide out of place. Your ligaments are looser, making your joints more flexible and likely to dislocate. This is especially true of girls. Cerebral palsy and Down syndrome can cause muscle weakness and balance problems that affect kneecaps. Some children are born with unstable kneecaps. No matter the cause, symptoms of kneecap dislocation are the same. If it’s only part of the way out, you’ll get a brace to keep you from moving your knee. Within 1 or 2 weeks, you’ll start physical therapy to strengthen your thigh muscles. You can expect about 1 to 3 months for recovery. If it pops totally out, your doctor will first gently push it back into place. In some cases, you might also need surgery to repair damage to your thigh bone or the cartilage behind your knee. If it keeps happening, you may need surgery to tighten the ligaments and help keep your kneecap on track. Subluxation This happens when your kneecap slides a little out of place but doesn’t dislocate entirely. It’s also a type of patellar instability. Symptoms that your kneecap has subluxated include: Pain in the front of your knee A feeling that your kneecap is loose Your knee suddenly buckles Fractures This is a serious injury where you break your kneecap, usually: In a fall, landing directly on your knee A direct hit to your knee, like slamming it against the dashboard in a car accident If you break your kneecap, your symptoms might include: Bruises You can’t walk You can’t straighten your knee or keep it straight when you raise your leg If the broken pieces are still lined up, you’ll get an immobilizer brace to hold everything in place as you heal. Sometimes, you can still put weight on your knee . In other cases, you might be off your feet for 6 to 8 weeks. For a more serious fracture, you typically need surgery. Your doctor may use screws, pins, or wires to hold the bone pieces in place. In either case, you’ll need physical therapy to work through stiffness, get your range of motion back, and build leg strength. Patellar Tendon Tear The patellar tendon starts in your thigh muscles, wraps around your kneecap, and connects to the top of your shinbone. If you completely tear the tendon above the kneecap (the quadriceps tendon) or below it (the patellar tendon), you won’t be able to straighten your knee. Small tears. For small tears, you typically wear a brace and have crutches for 3 to 6 weeks. The brace keeps your knee straight while your tendon heals. You’ll also get physical therapy to help with leg strength and range of motion. Large tears. Most people need surgery for a large patellar tendon tear. It usually takes 6 to 8 weeks for the tendon to heal after surgery, but it can take up to a year for a full recovery. Patellar Tendinitis Also called patellar tendinopathy or jumper’s knee, this is an injury to the patellar tendon. It’s common with people who play sports like basketball and volleyball. You typically start treatment with basic self-care, like rest and over-the-counter pain relievers. From there, you might need to see a physical therapist who can: Reduce pain and swelling with ice massage, ultrasound , or iontophoresis, which uses a small amount of electricity to push cortisone , a drug, into your body through your skin Give you stretches and strengthening exercises for your thigh muscles Show you how to use a patellar tendon strap to relieve pressure on the tendon If these treatments don’t work, your doctor may talk to you about getting a cortisone injection to help with pain and swelling. The drawback with this treatment is that it can also weaken the tendon and make a tear more likely. Another option is to get an injection of platelet -rich plasma . But this has not been proven to work better than physical therapy or other treatments. It’s rare, but if nothing else works, you might need surgery to remove damaged tissue and repair the tendon. Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome This catch-all term describes pain in the front of the knee and around the kneecap. Sometimes it’s called “runner’s knee” or a “tracking” problem. Typically caused by overuse, patellofemoral pain syndrome can lead to pain, stiffness, or a buckling feeling in the knee and lower thighbone. It’s common in athletes, especially females and young adults. If you have this condition, you might hurt when you: Go up or down stairs Kneel or squat Sit with your knees bent for a long time, such as during a movie or plane ride You might also hear popping or crackling in your knees when you climb stairs or get up after you’ve been sitting a long time. Patellofemoral pain syndrome can happen because of strain on your knees, like climbing too many steps. The pain might start because you’ve suddenly started to exercise more, such as going from working out 3 days a week to 6. Or maybe you’ve made your workouts more intense. Other things that might bring on patellofemoral pain syndrome: Poor exercise technique The wrong equipment, such as shoes Changing your exercise surface; for instance, running on streets after you’ve been running on a track Often, it gets better with over-the-counter pain relievers and the “RICE” method: Rest. Avoid activities that trigger pain, and try not to put any weight on your knee. Ice. Wrap an ice pack in a towel and apply it 20 minutes at a time, several times a day. Compress. Use a stretchy bandage that has a hole for your kneecap. You want it to feel snug but not tight. Elevate. Keep your knee higher than your heart as much as possible. Your doctor may suggest physical therapy to: Improve strength and range of motion in your thigh, hip, abs , and lower back Show you how to tape your knee or use a brace to reduce pain Teach you how to correct your form if your knee moves in when you squat Rarely, you might need surgery to remove damaged cartilage , loosen tendons, or realign the patellar tendon and the top of the shinbone. Patellar Tracking Disorder Patellofemoral pain syndrome also may come from an alignment problem in how your knee works. When you have misalignment, or a patellar tracking issue, your kneecap can push to one side of the trochlear groove when you bend your knee. That irritates the area, causing pain. Tracking problems could come from overall alignment issues between your leg and hip. Weak thigh muscles can also be part of the problem. Chondromalacia Patellae Damage to the cartilage behind the kneecap is called chondromalacia. You may feel a dull pain around or under your kneecap that gets worse when you go down stairs. Again, you’ll start with self-care: Avoiding activities that cause pain Applying an ice pack wrapped in a towel for 15 to 20 minutes, four times a day for several days Over-the-counter pain meds You might also see a physical therapist for help with: Changes in how you exercise -- you’ll need to avoid high-impact activities as well as kneeling and squatting Choosing the best footwear for your activities Safe exercises to stretch and strengthen your thigh and hamstring Shoe inserts, if you need them Tape, brace, or a sleeve to keep your kneecap aligned If these treatments don’t work, you may need surgery to remove damaged cartilage and correct kneecap alignment. Prepatellar Bursitis A bursa is a small, fluid-filled sac. It eases friction between bones and soft tissue, like tendons. With prepatellar bursitis , the bursa in the front of your knee gets irritated and swells with extra fluid. That puts pressure on your knee that leads to pain. If it happens due to an injury, it usually goes away on its own with a little self-care: Avoid activities that trigger pain Wrap an ice pack in a towel and apply it for 20 minutes, three to four times a day Keep your knee above your heart as much as possible Take over-the-counter pain relievers If these treatments don’t work, your doctor may: Take fluid out of the bursa using a needle Give you a cortisone injection to help with pain and swelling If the bursa is infected, you’ll also need antibiotics . If they don’t help, you may need surgery to get out the extra fluid. If you have repeated problems with the bursa, your doctor may suggest you have surgery to remove it. Prevention You can’t avoid every possible injury to your kneecap. But you can take some simple steps to help keep your knees healthy: Wear the right shoes for your activity. Warm up before you work out. Do exercises to keep your thigh muscles (quadriceps and hamstrings) strong and flexible. If you’re going to make your workouts longer or more intense, do it gradually. Cut back on anything that causes knee pain . Stay at a healthy weight -- it lowers stress on your knees."
13,What Is Urethral Cancer?,"When you use the bathroom, urine moves from your bladder through a tube called the urethra. The urethra goes through the prostate and the penis in men. In women, the tube is shorter and ends just above the opening to the vagina . If you have urethral cancer , cells in the area grow abnormally and out of control. Who’s at Risk? People over age 60, most often. Your risk might be higher, too, if you’ve had bladder cancer , frequent urinary tract infections, or sexually transmitted diseases that lead to an inflammation of the urethra. Urethral cancer has been linked to human papillomavirus, especially HPV 16. The HPV vaccine protects against type 16. Doctors recommend it for girls and boys at ages 11 or 12. The FDA has approved the Gardasil 9 HPV vaccine for males and females ages 9 to 45. Symptoms of Urethral Cancer You may not have any symptoms at first. Over time, you might notice it’s hard for you to pee. Maybe you have a weak urine flow or can’t hold it when you do have to go. Or perhaps you go to the bathroom more often, especially at night. You might see blood in the toilet or notice a discharge from your urethra. A swollen spot or a painless lump may appear in your groin or penis . These aren’t always signs of cancer, but can be signs of something else. See your doctor to know for sure. Types of Urethral Cancer There are three -- squamous cell carcinoma , transitional cell carcinoma , and adenocarcinoma . Squamous cell carcinoma. In women, it starts in the part of the urethra near the bladder. In men, it forms in the cells that line the urethra in the penis. This is the most common kind of urethral cancer. Transitional cell carcinoma. In women, cancer cells grow near where the urethra opens. In men, they grow where the tube passes through the prostate. Adenocarcinoma. In this form of the disease, cancerous cells begin to grow in the glands around the urethra. How Is It Diagnosed? If you have problems when you pee or any of the symptoms listed above, see your doctor. They’ll ask questions about your medical history and do a physical exam . This may include a pelvic and rectal exam. Your doctor might order blood tests and ask for a urine sample to look for abnormal cells. They may recommend a cystoscopy. That’s where they use a tool called a cystoscope to examine the inside of your urethra. They may do a biopsy . That means they’ll take cells from the urethra and bladder and look at them under a microscope to see if they’re cancerous. If your doctor finds that you have urethral cancer, they’ll order more tests to see if the cancer has spread to other parts of your body. (Cancer cells can move to other parts of your body through tissue, blood, and the lymph system. ) These tests may include chest X-rays, a CT scan of the pelvis and abdomen , or a magnetic resonance imaging test (MRI) of the pelvis. A procedure called urethrography can help your doctor see if there’s cancer in tissue close to the urethra. This is a series of X-rays your doctor performs after they inject contrast dye into the urethra and bladder. How Is It Treated? Most often, through surgery. But that depends on where the cancer is located. Sometimes, doctors can get rid of it just by removing the tumor. Other times, the urethra and bladder may be taken out. Your surgeon will need to make a new place for your body to store urine and build another way for the body to release it. After surgery, you may need to wear a bag outside your body to collect the urine. The vagina or part or all of the penis might also be removed. Plastic surgery may be performed to reconstruct the reproductive organs. Your doctor may use radiation or chemotherapy (“ chemo ”), either with or without surgery, to kill cancer cells. They may also use something called “ active surveillance ” to monitor the cancer. This means you’re not given treatment right away. Instead, your doctor will perform tests often to see if the cancer gets worse. If it does, they’ll develop a treatment plan."
14,What Causes Urinary Incontinence in Men?,"If you have a hard time controlling when urine comes out of your body, it’s called urinary incontinence. It means your body has lost some control over your bladder . It can be frustrating and embarrassing, but figuring out what’s causing your pee to leak can help you find ways to treat and cope with the problem. How Urine Leaks Normally, urine moves from your kidneys to your bladder through tubes called ureters. Your bladder stores your urine until a signal tells your brain that your bladder is full. Then urine leaves your body through a tube in your penis called the urethra. Urinary incontinence happens either because the signal to your brain gets scrambled or doesn’t happen, or because of a problem somewhere in your urinary tract. You may leak urine because: Your bladder squeezes too hard or at the wrong time The muscles around your urethra don’t work the way they should Your bladder doesn’t empty when it needs to, and gets too full Something is blocking your urethra Your urinary tract didn’t form correctly There are several reasons these things might be happening. There might be a medical condition behind it, or you may have had surgery recently that affects your bladder control. Conditions That Cause Urinary Incontinence There are several health and lifestyle issues that can make you start to leak urine. They can include: Problems with your prostate . It’s common for prostate issues to cause urinary incontinence. Your prostate may be larger due to a non-cancerous condition called benign prostatic hyperplasia ( BPH ). Your prostate may also be bigger than usual because of cancer . An enlarged prostate can block your urethra. When your urethra is blocked, your bladder has to work harder to squeeze pee out. This makes its walls thicker and weaker. That makes it hard for your bladder to empty all the urine in it. You can also struggle with urinary incontinence with prostate cancer or after having certain treatments for it -- such as radiation treatment or surgery to remove your prostate. The surgery may cause problems with the nerves that control your bladder. Certain diseases. Multiple sclerosis is a disease that can damage the nerves that tell the bladder when to empty and can also lead to bladder spasms . Some other conditions that can damage your nerves and keep your bladder from sending or receiving the signals it needs to work correctly are: Diabetes Stroke Alzheimer’s disease Parkinson’s disease Surgery. Major bowel surgery, lower back surgery , and prostate surgery can all cause problems with your bladder. This is usually because some of the nerves in your urinary tract have been damaged during surgery. Old age. Just like other muscles in your body, your bladder loses some of its tone and strength as you age and this can cause leaks. Obesity or lack of exercise . When you don’t get enough activity, you may start carrying extra weight. When you add pounds to your body, your bladder feels more pressure. This can make you go to the bathroom more often, because you have a harder time holding your urine for a long time. Chronic coughing . If sickness, allergies, or other problems keep you in coughing fits, it can put stress on your bladder and pelvic floor muscles. If they’re weak, they may struggle to keep pee inside. Urinary tract infection . Bacteria can sometimes infect part of your urinary tract. The infection can irritate your bladder and cause incontinence . Constipation . When your stool is hard or backed up, it can press on the nerves to your urinary system. This can cause leaks. Also good to know: drinking alcohol or taking certain medications like diuretics , antidepressants , sedatives, narcotics, or over-the-counter cold and diet medicines can make urinary incontinence worse. So, though they don’t cause the problem, they can worsen your symptoms. When to See Your Doctor It’s time to get things checked out if: You have to go to the bathroom a lot more than usual, and often can’t hold in your urine until you get to the toilet You leak when you sneeze , cough, or even stand up You leak at random times, even if you didn’t cough or sneeze You feel like your bladder still has urine in it, even after you go Your stream of urine is weak You have to strain when you urinate It hurts to urinate You feel pressure in your lower abdomen"
15,Types of Urinary Incontinence,"Urinary incontinence -- when you accidentally leak urine -- is a problem that affects millions of Americans, most of them women. There are several different types, causes, and treatments. Stress Incontinence With this type, urine leaks due to weakened pelvic floor muscles and tissues. It can happen when pressure on your bladder increases -- such as when you exercise, laugh, sneeze, or cough . Pregnancy and childbirth can stretch and weaken a woman’s pelvic floor muscles. Other things that can lead to stress incontinence are being overweight or obese , neurological conditions, trauma to the urethral sphincter muscle, taking certain medications or, in men, having prostate surgery. Urge Incontinence This is also called overactive bladder (OAB). With this type, you have an urgent need to go to the bathroom and may not get there in time. Causes of overactive bladder include: Damage to the bladder 's nerves Damage to other parts of the nervous system Damage to muscles Aging Conditions such as multiple sclerosis , Parkinson's disease, diabetes, and stroke can affect nerves, leading to urge incontinence . Bladder problems, such as infections and bladder stones, and certain medications can also cause it. Overflow Incontinence If you can't empty your bladder, you may have overflow incontinence . This means you may dribble urine. Causes include: Weak bladder muscles Nerve damage Conditions that block the flow of urine, such as tumors or an enlarged prostate Constipation Certain medications You need to get the condition treated. If your bladder can't empty, that can lead to infections and other problems. Functional Incontinence Mental or physical problems such as dementia or arthritis prevent you from getting to the bathroom in time. Mixed Urinary Incontinence This means you have any two types of the condition. Many women have both stress and urge incontinence. Treatment for Different Types of Urinary Incontinence Lifestyle changes and treatments can help with symptoms. Your doctor can help you come up with a plan that’s right for you. Behavioral therapies, vaginal inserts, electrical stimulation and surgery are the four treatment options for women with stress incontinence. The objective is to rehabilitate the pelvic floor by building the strength and function of the muscles that support the bladder, urethra and other organs contained within the pelvic region. For stress incontinence , treatments include: Pads and Vaginal Inserts. Pelvic floor exercises . If you've had a baby, chances are you've been told to do Kegel exercises. These help to strengthen the pelvic floor after childbirth. They also help prevent stress incontinence. Best of all, you can do Kegels anytime, anywhere. Here's how: Squeeze the muscles that you use stop the flow of urine. Hold the squeeze for 10 seconds, then rest for 10 seconds. Do 3 or 4 sets daily. Note: You can learn how to do Kegels by stopping your urine, but don’t do this routinely. Stopping the flow of urine can lead to an infection. Biofeedback . A probe is inserted to monitor when your bladder muscles squeeze. When you’re able to recognize it as it's happening, you can start to gain control of it. It's often used in combination with Kegel exercises . Electrical Stimulation : electrical stimulation is FDA approved for the treatment of SUI. It uses low-grade electrical current to stimulate weak or inactive pelvic muscles to contract. Regular electrical stimulation sessions can supplement or augment your pelvic muscle exercise regime. Units are available for home use and may be covered by Medicare or insurers. They include a  coin-sized device called a tibial neurostimulator that can be implanted in the lower leg and reduce UUI symptoms. Pessary . For women, doctors may prescribe a device called a pessary that is inserted into the vagina . It repositions the urethra to help reduce leakage. Injections and surgery . Shots to bulk up your urethral area may help. In more extreme cases, you may need surgery. One procedure pulls the urethra back up to a more normal position, relieving the pressure and leakage. Another surgery involves securing the urethra with a ""sling,"" a piece of material that holds up the urethra to prevent leakage. For urge incontinence, treatment options include: Timed voiding and bladder training . First, you complete a chart of the times you pee and the times you leak. You observe patterns and then plan to empty your bladder before an accident would happen. You can also ""retrain"" your bladder, gradually increasing the time between bathroom visits. Kegel exercises are also helpful. Medications, electrical stimulation, or surgery . Doctors sometimes prescribe medicines (or inject Botox in the bladder) that block the contractions of an overactive bladder. Electrical stimulation of the bladder nerves helps in some cases. Surgery is reserved for severe cases. It aims to increase the amount of urine your bladder can store. For overflow incontinence, treatments include: Pads. Medication or surgery . Meds called alpha-blockers often can help if the problem is caused by an enlarged prostate . If there's a blockage, you may need surgery. Catheter . Some people use a catheter to make sure their bladder is emptied. It's a thin plastic tube that you insert in your urethra. A doctor or nurse can teach you how to insert it for yourself. It's important to identify any underlying disease or blockage causing overflow incontinence and treat that. Talk to Your Doctor You might feel embarrassed to talk about your urinary incontinence , but it’s worth it. Your doctor can help you figure out what’s causing your problem. That’s the first step to getting help. Be straightforward. Just tell your doctor you're having problems. Keep it simple: ""I'm having bladder problems."" Your doctor should ask questions, like how long the leakage has been happening, how bad it is, and how much it upsets your life. They may suggest tests or refer you to an expert in this kind of problem."
16,What Are Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs)?,"UTIs, Explained UTIs are bacterial infections in the urinary system. They’re very common and usually not serious, though there can be exceptions. Your urinary tract includes your bladder, kidneys, ureters (tubes that go from your kidneys to your bladder), and urethra (the tube that carries urine out of your body from your bladder). If you have a UTI in your kidneys, doctors call it pyelonephritis. If it’s in your bladder, the medical term is cystitis . Who Gets Urinary Tract Infections? Anyone can. But they're more likely when you: Are a woman Have had UTIs before Have a condition that affects your bladder's nerves (including diabetes , multiple sclerosis , Parkinson's disease , and spinal cord injuries) Have been through menopause Are overweight Have something that blocks the passage of urine, such as a tumor, kidney stone, or an enlarged prostate Use a diaphragm or spermicide for birth control Have a catheter, a tube placed into the bladder to drain urine from the bladder into a bag outside the body Are a man who has sex with men, has HIV , or hasn’t been circumcised Most of these traits also raise the odds that a simple bladder infection may become a more serious kidney infection or turn into sepsis (an infection that has gotten into your bloodstream). For pregnant women, a kidney infection can lead to delivering a baby too early. Infection Causes Most UTIs are due to bacteria that are normally found in your gut, such as E. coli . Other bacteria that can cause them include staphylococcus, proteus, klebsiella, enterococcus, and pseudomonas. Some bladder infections in both men and women are linked to sexually transmitted infections, including Chlamydia trachomatis , mycoplasma , and ureaplasma. The parasite trichomonas can also cause similar symptoms. If you have a problem with your immune system, from an autoimmune disease or diabetes, you're more likely to get UTIs because your body can't do a good job fighting off the germs that cause these infections. Anatomy Plays a Role Women are more likely to get UTIs because the tube that goes from the bladder to the outside (the urethra) is much shorter than in men. Because the urethral opening is closer to the anus in women, it’s easier for bacteria from stool to get into their urethra. Contact and fluids spread during sex also make it easier for bacteria from the vagina and anus to get into the urethra. In men, a bladder infection is almost always a symptom of another condition. Often, the infection has moved from the prostate or some other part of the body. Or it may mean that a stone, tumor, or something else is blocking the urinary tract. Chronic kidney infections sometimes happen because of a structural problem that allows urine to flow from the bladder back to the kidneys or because the bladder doesn’t empty completely. These problems are often found at an early age, but they affect adults, too. In rare cases, UTIs can happen because there's an abnormal connection between the bladder or urethra and another organ or passageway like the intestines or uterus."
17,Hives and Your Skin,"Urticaria, also known as hives, is an outbreak of pale red bumps or welts on the skin that appear suddenly. The swelling that often comes with hives is called angioedema. Allergic reactions, chemicals in certain foods, insect stings, sunlight, and medications can cause hives. It's often impossible to find out exactly why hives have formed. What Causes Hives? There are several types of hives, including: Acute urticaria. These are hives that last less than 6 weeks. The most common causes are foods, medications, and infections. Insect bites and diseases may also be responsible. The most common foods that cause hives are nuts, chocolate, fish, tomatoes, eggs, fresh berries, and milk. Fresh foods cause hives more often than cooked foods. Certain food additives and preservatives may also be to blame. Drugs that can cause hives include aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications such as ibuprofen, high blood pressure drugs (especially ACE inhibitors), or painkillers such as codeine. Chronic urticaria. These are hives that last more than 6 weeks. The cause is usually harder to identify than those causing acute urticaria. For most people with chronic urticaria, the cause is impossible to find. In some cases, though, the cause may be thyroid , hepatitis, infection, or cancer. Chronic urticaria can also affect organs such as the lungs, muscles, and gastrointestinal tract. Symptoms include shortness of breath, muscle soreness, vomitin g , and diarrhea. Physical urticaria. These hives are caused by something that stimulates the skin -- for example, cold, heat, sun exposure, vibration, pressure, sweating, or exercise. The hives usually occur right where the skin was stimulated and rarely appear elsewhere. Most of the hives appear within 1 hour. Dermatographism. This is a common form of physical urticaria where hives form after firmly stroking or scratching the skin. These hives can also occur along with other forms of urticaria. The Link to Contact Dermatitis Contact dermatitis is a painful or itchy rash you get after your skin touches something you're allergic to (allergic contact dermatitis) or that's otherwise irritating to your skin (irritant contact dermatitis). It's not the same as hives. But sometimes people with contact dermatitis also get hives after they come into contact with an allergen. How Are Hives Diagnosed? Your doctor will need to ask many questions in an attempt to find the possible cause of hives. Since there are no specific tests for hives -- or the associated swelling of angioedema -- testing will depend on your medical history and a thorough exam by your doctor. Your doctor may do skin tests to find out what you're allergic to. Or they may test your blood to see if you have an illness. How Are Hives Treated? The best treatment for hives is to find and remove the trigger, but this is not an easy task. Antihistamines are usually prescribed by your doctor to provide relief from symptoms. Antihistamines work best if taken on a regular schedule to prevent hives from forming in the first place. Chronic hives may be treated with antihistamines or a combination of medications. When antihistamines don't provide relief, oral steroids may be prescribed. A biologic drug, omalizumab (Xolair), is also approved to treat chronic hives in people at least 12 years old. For severe hives, you might need an injection of epinephrine or a cortisone medication. How Can Hives Be Managed? While you're waiting for hives and swelling to disappear, here are some tips: Apply cool compresses or wet cloths to the affected areas. Try to work and sleep in a cool room. Wear loose-fitting lightweight clothes. When Should I Call the Doctor About Hives? If you have hives with any of the following symptoms, contact your doctor right away: Dizziness Wheezing Difficulty breathing Tightness in the chest Swelling of the tongue, lips, or face"
18,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,"What Is Abnormal Uterine Bleeding? Abnormal uterine bleeding is when you bleed outside of your normal monthly period. You might hear it called anovulatory bleeding. Your flow could also be heavier or last longer than what’s typical. When it comes to menstrual cycles, there’s a wide range of “normal.” But your period shouldn’t be a problem for you month after month. If it’s so heavy or unpredictable that it keeps you from doing some activities or makes you miss work or school, you may have a medical condition that should be treated. Abnormal Uterine Bleeding Symptoms The signs of abnormal uterine bleeding include: Heavy period Bleeding between your periods, after sex, or during menopause Long periods (more than 7 days) Irregular periods Doctors check these things when diagnosing abnormal uterine bleeding : How often you get your period. It should be fairly regular. The length of each cycle shouldn’t change by more than a week. If it’s shorter than 3 weeks or longer than 5, that could be a sign of a problem. How long it lasts. A typical period lasts 4 or 5 days. If yours is often less than 2 days or longer than a week, that could mean something’s wrong. How heavy it is. Most women only lose about 2 tablespoons of blood each period. More than 5 tablespoons is thought to be unusually heavy, but that’s hard to judge. Let your doctor know if you need more than one tampon or pad in an hour. Abnormally heavy menstrual bleeding is called menorrhagia . Whether you have spotting between periods. Whether you have bleeding after sex. If you could be pregnant or you’re past menopause and have any kind of bleeding, call your doctor. Some spotting is common early in pregnancy, but bleeding can be a sign of a serious condition called an ectopic pregnancy . That’s when a fertilized egg implants somewhere outside your uterus, most commonly in a fallopian tube. It could also mean you’re having a miscarriage . After menopause, women who take hormone replacement therapy may still have periods. But any bleeding should be checked out. Abnormal Uterine Bleeding Causes There are a few possible causes of abnormal uterine bleeding: Hormone changes. Problems with your hormones are the most common reason for abnormal uterine bleeding. When one of your ovaries releases an egg (called ovulation ), certain hormones tell your body to build up and then shed the lining of your uterus (called the endometrium ). With teenagers and women getting close to menopause, the endometrium can build up too much. That can lead to an irregular or heavy period or spotting between periods. These things can throw off your hormones, too: Birth control pills and other medicines like warfarin and hormone therapy Fast weight loss or gain Emotional or physical stress An intrauterine device (IUD) Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) Problems with your uterus. Another possible reason for abnormal bleeding is a physical problem with your uterus. Millions of women have fibroids -- noncancerous tumors that grow in the muscles of the wall of the uterus. A polyp is another kind of growth that can form in the lining of your uterus. A condition called adenomyosis is where the cells similar to the ones that grow in the lining of the uterus start to grow in the muscle part of the uterus. Endometriosis can also cause abnormal bleeding. This is when tissue like the kind that lines the inside of your uterus grows outside of your uterus. Other health conditions. These are much less common, but abnormal uterine bleeding also can result from: Cancer of the cervix , endometrium, or uterus Illnesses that affect your kidneys , liver , thyroid , or adrenal glands Infection of your cervix or endometrium Sexually transmitted diseases Abnormal Uterine Bleeding Diagnosis It can help to take detailed notes over a few cycles so you can give the doctor specific information about your symptoms. They’ll also ask about your overall health and give you a physical exam . You’ll probably get a pregnancy test , and you may also have: Blood work. Heavy bleeding can leave your body short of iron. A blood test can see if that’s a problem for you. It can also show if your hormones are out of balance or if you have a blood disorder or chronic disease. Ultrasound . This uses sound waves to make images of the inside of your uterus so your doctor can look for fibroids or polyps. Hysteroscopy. The doctor will look inside your uterus with a tiny lighted scope that they put in through your cervix. Biopsy . The doctor may take out a small piece of tissue and check it under a microscope for abnormal cells. Magnetic resonance imaging . This test uses radio waves and powerful magnets to make detailed pictures of your uterus. It isn’t used that often, but it can help spot adenomyosis. Abnormal Uterine Bleeding Treatment Your treatment will depend on the cause of the abnormal uterine bleeding. If a chronic illness or a blood disorder is at the root of your symptoms, treating that can help. Treatment also can depend on whether you plan to have children. It might not be safe to get pregnant after some treatments, while others can make it impossible. If you’re close to menopause, the doctor may want to take a wait-and-see approach because your symptoms may get better on their own. Drugs are usually the first thing your doctor will try. They include: Hormones. Birth control pills and other hormone treatments may be able to give you regular menstrual cycles and lighter periods. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa) and GnRHA antagonists. These control heavy bleeding by stopping your body from making certain hormones. They may shrink fibroids for a while. They’re usually used along with other treatments. NSAIDS . If you take anti-inflammatories like ibuprofen or naproxen a few days before your period starts, they may help lighten the bleeding. Tranexamic acid . This is a pill that helps your blood clot and can control heavy uterine bleeding. IUD. For some women, an IUD that releases a hormone called progestin can stop heavy bleeding. Many women who use one don’t get a period at all. They may not be right for you if you have fibroids in the cavity of your uterus rather than the wall. Sometimes you might need surgery to stop the bleeding: Endometrial ablation. This uses heat, cold, electricity, or a laser to destroy the lining of your uterus. It may end your periods entirely. You probably won’t be able to get pregnant after having it done, but it can be dangerous if you do. You’ll need to use birth control until menopause. Myomectomy or uterine artery embolization. If you have fibroids, the doctor may take them out or cut off the vessels that supply them with blood. Hysterectomy . This is when the doctor removes your uterus. You may need a hysterectomy if your fibroids are very large or you have endometrial or uterine cancer . Otherwise, it’s a last resort when other treatments haven’t worked. Abnormal Uterine Bleeding Complications Complications that may happen with abnormal uterine bleeding include: Trouble getting pregnant Anemia or blood loss"
19,Understanding Endometrial Cancer -- the Basics,"What Is Endometrial Cancer? Cancer can affect the uterus, the hollow, pear-shaped organ where a baby grows. The uterus is lined with a special tissue called the endometrium. When cancer grows in this lining, it is called endometrial cancer . Most cancers of the uterus are endometrial cancer. If left untreated, endometrial cancer can spread to the bladder or rectum, or it can spread to the vagina , fallopian tubes, ovaries, and more distant organs. Fortunately, endometrial cancer grows slowly and, with regular checkups, is usually found before spreading very far. What Does the Type of Endometrial Cancer Mean? If you get diagnosed with endometrial cancer, your doctor might tell you it’s type 1 or type 2. About 80% of endometrial cancers are type 1. This kind usually doesn’t form, grow, or spread very quickly. Experts think it’s caused by having too much of the sex hormone estrogen. Sometimes it develops from a condition called atypical hyperplasia, which is when too many cells grow in the endometrium. The prognosis for people with type 1 endometrial cancer is usually good. Prognosis is an estimate of how the course of the disease will go for you. Up to 20% of endometrial cancer is type 2. This type is more likely to grow and spread outside of your uterus. Experts don’t think that having too much estrogen causes it. The prognosis (outlook) isn’t as good compared with type 1. Doctors usually need to treat type 2 endometrial cancer with more intense treatments. Grading Endometrial Cancer If you get a diagnosis of type 1 or type 2 endometrial cancer, your doctor might talk to you about its “grade.” For most cancers, the grade (also called “differentiation”) is a number that tells you how abnormal your cancer cells look under a microscope. A lower number means the cancer cells are more normal-looking, and in general that means your cancer is more likely to be slow-growing. For instance, grades 1 and 2 endometrioid adenocarcinoma are considered type 1 endometrial cancer. Your doctor may call these “lower grade.” Grade 3 endometrioid tumors are considered type 2 endometrial cancer. The doctor might call it higher grade or “poorly differentiated.” Are There Different Kinds of Endometrial Cancer? Yes. Doctors divide them up into different categories based on how their cells look under a microscope. The most common type of endometrial cancer is a kind of adenocarcinoma (cancer that forms in glandular tissue) called endometroid cancer. Endometrioid cancer starts in the glands of your endometrium (uterine lining), and under the microscope it looks very similar to normal uterine lining (endometrium). It varies from person to person in terms of how severe it is. Some other kinds of endometrial cancer are: Uterine papillary serous carcinoma: This rarer form of endometrial and uterine cancer starts in the lining of the uterus. It tends to come back even if your doctor spots it early. Uterine clear cell carcinoma: This form is even more rare, accounting for less than 5% of cases. Uterine carcinosarcoma: This rare kind of endometrial and uterine cancer also makes up less than 5% of cases, but it tends to be aggressive. That means it forms, grows, or spreads quickly. What Are the Risk Factors for Endometrial Cancer? Endometrial cancer usually happens in women past menopause. More than 95% of endometrial cancer happens in women over 40. Postmenopausal women have a high risk for endometrial cancer if they: Got their first period early Went through menopause late Are obese Have diabetes or high blood pressure Have few or no children Have a history of infertility , irregular periods, or abnormal cells in the endometrium (called endometrial hyperplasia) Have a family history of endometrial, colorectal, or breast cancer Women taking the drug tamoxifen to treat or prevent breast cancer have a slightly higher risk of endometrial cancer. But women who have taken birth control pills are only half as likely to have endometrial cancer after menopause. Women who take estrogen-only hormone replacement therapy have a higher risk of developing endometrial cancer. So women who have not had a hysterectomy should not be taking estrogen-only hormone replacement therapy . Rare ovarian tumors can make estrogen and increase a woman’s chance of having endometrial cancer. High-fat diets, especially containing red meat, can increase the risk of cancer, including endometrial and colon cancer . What Are the Survival Rates for Endometrial Cancer? It depends on how far your cancer has spread when you’re first diagnosed with it. To show the survival rates for endometrial cancer, the American Cancer Society uses a database that groups this type of cancer into three stages that describe how far it has spread: Localized means there’s no sign that your endometrial cancer has spread beyond your uterus. Regional means the disease has spread to nearby areas or lymph nodes. Distant means the cancer has spread far away, to parts of the body like your lungs, liver, or bones. If you have localized endometrial cancer, the 5-year relative survival rate is 96%. That means that people who have your type of cancer are about 96% as likely as people who don’t have that cancer to live for at least 5 years, on average, after they’re diagnosed. The 5-year relative survival rate for regional endometrial cancer is 71%. For distant endometrial cancer it’s 20%. Keep in mind that other things affect your outlook, like your age, general health, and how well you respond to treatment. And if you’ve just gotten diagnosed with endometrial cancer, you may have a better outlook than these numbers suggest. That’s because treatments get better over time, and these numbers are based on women who got diagnosed and treated at least 5 years earlier. Can Endometrial Cancer Be Prevented? Most endometrial cancer cannot be prevented. But there are certain things women can do to lower their risk. Taking birth control lowers the risk, but first talk with a doctor about possible pros and cons. Being healthy, eating well, and watching your weight may help lower the risk."
20,Uterine Fibroids,"What Are Uterine Fibroids? Uterine fibroids can cause symptoms ranging from mild to serious, including painful periods. Experts have a couple of ideas about why you may get them. (Photo Credit: iStock/Getty Images) Uterine fibroids , which your doctor may call leiomyomas or myomas, are tumors made of muscle that can grow on your uterus. They rarely turn into cancer . And if you get them, it doesn’t mean you’re more likely to get uterine cancer. Fibroids can vary a lot in size, shape, and location. They can show up in your uterus, uterine wall, or on its surface. They can also attach to your uterus by a stalk- or stem-like structure. Some are so small that your doctor can’t even see them with the naked eye . Others grow in big masses that can affect the size and shape of your uterus. Uterine fibroids usually appear when you're of childbearing age – generally between 30 and 40 years old – but they can show up at any age. They’re more common in Black people than in White people. They also tend to show up earlier and grow quicker in Black people. Doctors don’t know why. Uterine Fibroid vs. Polyp Although they have similar symptoms, uterine fibroids and polyps are different. Uterine polyps are smaller and grow from the lining of the uterus. They can eventually block the opening of your fallopian tubes and stop you from getting pregnant. A small number of polyps, around 5%, turn out to be cancerous or have abnormal cells that are more likely to turn into cancer. It's why most gynecologists suggest removing them. Treatments include medication, surgery, and watchful waiting to see if polyps get better on their own. Types of Fibroids The type of fibroids you have depends on where they grow or form. Intramural fibroid This type of fibroid grows within the wall of your uterus. Submucosal fibroids When a fibroid grows into your uterine cavity, doctors call it submucosal. Subserosal fibroid This type of fibroid happens on the outside of your uterus. At times, submucosal or subserosal fibroids may hang from a stalk inside or outside of your uterus (called pedunculated). Symptoms of Uterine Fibroids Fibroids may cause very mild symptoms, no symptoms at all, or symptoms that are serious. The most common symptoms of uterine fibroids include: Heavy, long, or painful periods Pain in the lower belly or back Painful sex Peeing often Discomfort in the rectum Causes of Uterine Fibroids Experts don’t know exactly why you get fibroids. Hormones and genetics might make you more likely to get them. Hormones . Estrogen and progesterone are the hormones that make the lining of your uterus thicken every month during your period. They also seem to affect fibroid growth. When hormone production slows down during menopause , fibroids usually shrink. Genetics . Researchers have found genetic differences between fibroids and normal cells in the uterus. Other growth factors. Substances in your body that help with tissue upkeep, such as insulin-like growth factor, may play a part in fibroid growth. Extracellular matrix (ECM). ECM makes your cells stick together. Fibroids have more ECM than normal cells, which makes them fibrous or ropey. ECM also stores growth factors (substances that spur cell growth) and causes cells to change. Uterine Fibroid Risk Factors A few things can raise your chances of getting uterine fibroids, such as: Age Race Getting your period at a young age Birth control pill use before age 16 Vitamin D deficiency Eating too much red meat and not enough green vegetables, fruit, or dairy Alcohol Family history You’re more likely to get fibroids if close relatives like your mom or sister have had them. Uterine Fibroid Diagnosis Your doctor may suspect you have uterine fibroids just from feeling your uterus during a routine pelvic exam. If the shape of your uterus feels irregular or unusually large, they may order further tests, such as: Ultrasound. Ultrasounds use sound waves to take a picture of your uterus. A technician will place a device either in your vagina or on your belly to get the images. Then your doctor can see if you have fibroids and where and how large they are. Lab tests. Your doctor may want you to have blood tests to help figure out why you have fibroids. Your complete blood count can help them decide whether you have anemia (low levels of red blood cells) or other bleeding disorders. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). If your doctor needs more information after you have an ultrasound, you may also have an MRI. MRIs show more detailed images of fibroids and can help doctors decide the best treatment. Your doctor may also suggest an MRI if you have a large uterus or are close to menopause. Hysterosonography. In this test, a technician pushes a small amount of saline solution into your uterine cavity to make it larger. This helps them see fibroids that are growing into your uterus (submucosal fibroids) and the lining of your uterus. This is useful if you’re trying to get pregnant or have heavy periods. Hysterosalpingography. If your doctor needs to see if your fallopian tubes are blocked, you might have a hysterosalpingography. Your doctor uses dye to highlight your uterus and fallopian tubes on an X-ray to see these areas better. Hysteroscopy. Your doctor inserts a small telescope with a light attached into your cervix. Then, after injecting saline and expanding your uterine cavity, they can look at the walls of your uterus and fallopian tube opening. Uterine Fibroid Treatment There are many ways to treat fibroids. The treatment that works best for you will depend on whether you’re having symptoms, want to get pregnant, your age, and where your fibroids are. Watchful waiting. If you have only mild symptoms – or no symptoms – your doctor may suggest you simply wait and see. Fibroids aren’t cancerous, and they may grow slowly or not at all. They also may shrink or go away after menopause. Medications. Medications for fibroids treat your symptoms. Fibroids won’t go away but might shrink with some medications. They can also help with symptoms like pain and bleeding. Birth control pills can reduce bleeding. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications such as ibuprofen or naproxen can ease pain. Vitamins and iron supplements can help with energy if you’re bleeding heavily and have anemia as a result. Other medications include: Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists put you in a temporary menopause state by blocking estrogen and progesterone. This may shrink your fibroids. You take them as shots. Your doctor may choose this option before you have surgery. GnRH antagonists work in a different way to reduce or stop your period. Oriahnn and Myfembree combine GnRH antagonists with estrogen and progestin. You take them as pills. A progestin-releasing intrauterine device (IUD) inserted into your uterus can help control heavy bleeding. It also prevents pregnancy. But it might not be right for you if you have fibroids in the cavity of your uterus. Tranexamic acid (Cyklokapron, Lysteda) is a medication that doesn’t involve hormones. You take it on days you’re bleeding heavily to slow your flow. Surgery. If you have moderate or severe symptoms, you may need surgery for relief. Options include: Myomectomy. This surgery takes out fibroids while trying to leave healthy tissue alone. This might be your best option if you hope to become pregnant in the future. There are multiple ways to do a myomectomy, from major abdominal surgery to laparoscopy (surgery done through one or more small cuts instead of one large one). Endometrial ablation. A surgeon uses either a laser, wire loops, boiling water, an electric current, microwaves, or freezing to remove or destroy the lining of your uterus. You may be able to have this minor surgery as an outpatient. Typically, you’ll stop having periods afterward, and you'll no longer be able to get pregnant. Uterine fibroid embolization (UFE), or uterine artery embolization (UAE). In this procedure, a doctor blocks the flow of blood to your fibroids by inserting gel or plastic particles into the nearby blood vessels. This makes the fibroids shrink. Hysterectomy. This surgery removes your uterus completely. This is the only way to cure fibroids entirely. It’s a major surgery, but your doctor has options for how to do it, including cutting through your belly or even laparoscopy. Uterine Fibroid Complications Most of the time, uterine fibroids aren't dangerous, but some people do have further health problems, such as anemia. Heavy blood loss and a drop in red blood cells cause the condition. Your doctor may suggest you take an iron supplement to avoid or manage anemia. People with severe anemia need donor blood (a transfusion). Which Size of Fibroid is Dangerous? Since most small fibroids don't cause symptoms, you probably won't need treatment. Instead, you and your doctor will keep an eye on your symptoms. Larger fibroids can cause serious health problems like severe pain and heavy bleeding. You'll need treatment based on your symptoms, the size of the fibroids, how many you have, and where they're located. Most fibroids are between 2 and 6 centimeters. Fibroids larger than this can cause heavy bleeding, and your doctor may face challenges in removing them. Uterine Fibroid Prevention Fibroids can’t be prevented, but research suggests certain lifestyle habits can reduce your chances of having them. One study found that high-sugar diets may be linked to a higher risk in some people. Another study found that eating fresh fruits and cruciferous vegetables like arugula, broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, collard greens, and turnip greens could lower your odds. Cruciferous vegetables are rich in beta carotene, folate, vitamins C, E, and K, and other minerals. They’re also full of fiber. Regular exercise also can lower your chances of getting uterine fibroids. Uterine Fibroids and Pregnancy Most people with uterine fibroids don't have trouble getting pregnant, but some fibroids can cause infertility or the loss of a pregnancy. If you're pregnant, the condition also raises the odds of health problems with your baby, such as being born too early and restricted growth. Uterine Fibroids After Menopause A drop in hormone levels after menopause tends to help shrink uterine fibroids, and you may notice your symptoms get better. Can fibroids still grow after menopause? It's unusual for uterine fibroids to keep growing after menopause. Talk to your doctor about any concerning fibroid symptoms after menopause, as they could be a sign of another health problem. Takeaways Uterine fibroids are noncancerous tumors made of muscle that can grow on the uterus. They vary in size, shape, and location, with symptoms including heavy periods, lower belly or back pain, painful sex, and peeing too often. We don't know the exact cause of the condition, but hormones, genetics, and other factors may lead to it. Treatment options range from watchful waiting for mild symptoms to medications and surgery for more severe cases. Lifestyle habits such as a healthy diet and regular exercise may lower your chances of getting uterine fibroids."
21,What Is Uveitis?,"Uveitis is a broad term for many problems with your eye. What they have in common is eye inflammation and swelling that can destroy eye tissues. That destruction can lead to poor vision or blindness. The word “uveitis” is used because the swelling most often affects the part of your eye called the uvea. Your eye is made of layers. The uvea is the middle layer.  It’s between the white part of your eye -- called the sclera -- and the inner layers of your eye. Your uvea contains three important structures: The iris. That’s the colored circle at the front of your eye. The ciliary body. Its job is to help your lens focus and make the fluid that nourishes the inside of your eye. The choroid. This is a group of blood vessels that give your retina the nutrients it needs. Are There Different Types of Uveitis? Yes. Which type you have depends on where the swelling is. Anterior uveitis is the most common. It affects the front of your eye. Intermediate uveitis affects your ciliary body. Posterior uveitis affects the back of your eye. If your entire uvea is inflamed, you have panuveitis . What Causes It? Many things, and they’re all tied to inflammation. For example, a toxic substance could get into your eye and cause inflammation. So could a bruise to your eye. Uveitis may also be caused by an autoimmune disease, meaning your body is attacking itself. That attack causes inflammation, and so do infections and tumors in your eye or other parts of your body. Are Some People at Greater Risk? Folks with certain gene combinations and those who smoke seem to be at greater risk. Some diseases also increase the chances, including: AIDS Ankylosing spondylitis Behcet’s disease CMV retinitis Herpes zoster infection Histoplasmosis Kawasaki disease Multiple sclerosis Psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis Reactive arthritis Rheumatoid arthritis Sarcoidosis Syphilis Toxoplasmosis Tuberculosis Ulcerative colitis Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease Symptoms They can affect one or both eyes, and they may come on quickly. In some cases, they happen more gradually. The warning signs include: Eye redness Pain Blurry or lessened vision and sensitivity to light Floaters, those tiny dots or specks in your vision If you have any of these, it’s important to see your eye doctor. Prompt diagnosis and treatment can help save your vision. Diagnosis Your eye doctor will want to know about your medical history and overall health. This is because uveitis can be a result of other diseases. They may order blood tests, skin tests, or X-rays. They’ll also give you a thorough eye exam. Treatment The first step may be eye drops that have medicine -- usually a corticosteroid -- to fight inflammation. You might get dilating eye drops to prevent scarring and relax your eye muscles to cut eye twitches. If the drops don’t work, your doctor may add a pill or injection. If an infection causes your uveitis, you’ll get other drugs, too. These infection fighters include antibiotics and antivirals. If you don’t get better with those treatments, or if your uveitis is severe, your doctor may prescribe stronger drugs. These drugs may include immunosuppressives. Those dampen your immune system. You’d use them with corticosteroids. If you have anterior uveitis, your doctor will probably prescribe eye drops at first. If you have intermediate, posterior, or panuveitis, they may give you injections, oral medications, or an immunosuppressive drug. They could also suggest an implantable device that slowly releases medication. In some cases, your doctor may recommend a procedure to remove some of the gel-like substance in your eye. You may hear them call it vitreous. Treatment is important and can prevent serious complications. Make sure you report any new symptom to your doctor, and go to your follow-up visits as your doctor says."
