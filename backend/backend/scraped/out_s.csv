0,What Is Chordoma?,"Chordoma is a kind of cancer that grows in the bones of your skull and spine. It's very rare. Only 1 out of every 1 million people gets it. About 300 people are diagnosed with chordoma in the United States each year. You can get it at any age -- even in childhood. But most people are diagnosed between ages 40 and 70. Men get it more often than women. Chordomas can form anywhere in your back, neck, or skull. Many grow in the bottom of your spine or at the base of your skull. From there, they can spread to other organs, like your lungs . But they usually grow slowly. Because they're close to important areas like the brain and spinal cord, they need to be treated very carefully. Causes In the womb, a baby has a thin bar called a notochord that runs along their back. This bar supports the bones of the spine as they grow. The notochord disappears before the baby is born. In a small number of people, some of the notochord cells are left behind in the spine and skull. Doctors believe chordoma starts because of a change in the gene that carries instructions for making a protein that helps the spine form. This change causes notochord cells that are left in the brain or spinal cord to divide too quickly. This change usually happens randomly -- no one in your family has to have chordoma for you to get it. But it can run in families in rare instances. Symptoms Chordomas can press on nerves in your spine or brain . This can cause pain , numbness, or weakness. Your symptoms depend on where the cancer is and how big it is. Chordoma in the skull causes symptoms like: Abnormal eye movements Changes to your voice or speech Double vision Headache Loss of feeling and movement in your face Neck pain Trouble swallowing Chordoma of the spine causes symptoms like: Loss of control over your bowels Lump in the lower part of your back Numbness, tingling, or weakness in your arms or legs Pain in your lower back Problems controlling your bladder Sometimes, chordomas in the brain can block the flow of fluid there and in the spine. The fluid can build up and put pressure on the brain. This is called hydrocephalus . Diagnosis Your doctor can do imaging tests to see where the cancer is inside your body and how big it's grown. These include: X-ray: Low doses of radiation are used to make images of your brain or spinal cord. CT (computed tomography) scan: X-rays are taken from several different angles and put together to make detailed pictures of the affected area. MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): Powerful magnets and radio waves are used to make pictures of organs and other structures inside your body. A biopsy is the only test that can confirm you have chordoma. Your doctor will use a needle to take a small sample of cells from the tumor. A specialist will look at the cells under a microscope to see what kind of tumor you have. Your doctor might also do a blood test, a CT scan of your lungs , or a bone scan to see if the tumor has spread. Treatment Your treatment will depend on: Your age Your health Size of the tumor Where the tumor is Often, doctors remove the tumor with surgery. Taking out as much of the tumor as possible and some of the tissue around it can stop it from coming back. Sometimes surgeons can't remove the whole tumor because they might damage healthy cells in your brain or spine. Radiation -- high energy X-rays -- can kill any cancer cells that are left behind after surgery. This lowers the chance that the cancer will return. Still, chordoma often comes back after treatment. During the first year after your surgery, your doctor will check you with an MRI about once every 3 months to make sure it hasn't. If it does come back, you might need another surgery. Researchers are studying several new treatments for chordoma. They test these in clinical trials to see if they're safe and if they work. These are often a way for people to try a new therapy that isn't available to everyone. Your doctor can tell you if there's a trial that might be a good fit for you."
1,Is Your SI Joint Giving You Back Pain?,"If you stand up from your chair and feel a pain in your lower back, it could be your SI joint acting up. Don't let it get the best of you! Take charge with a treatment plan that brings relief. What Is the SI Joint? Its full name is the sacroiliac joint. There are two of them in your lower back, and they sit on each side of your spine. Their main job is to carry the weight of your upper body when you stand or walk and shift that load to your legs. What Does the Pain Feel Like? It could be a dull or sharp pain. It starts at your SI joint, but it can move to your buttocks, thighs, groin, or upper back. Sometimes standing up triggers the pain, and a lot of times you feel it only on one side of your lower back. You may notice that it bothers you more in the morning and gets better during the day. It's more common than you might think. About 15%-30% of people who hurt like this have a problem with the SI joint. Why Is This Happening? The pain starts when your SI joint gets inflamed. There are several reasons it could happen. You could hurt it when you play sports or if you fall down. You might also get this problem from an activity that gives the area a regular pounding, like jogging . Do you take uneven strides when you walk because one of your legs is longer than the other? That could be a cause of SI joint pain . Sometimes you start hurting when the ligaments that hold your SI joint together are damaged, which may make the joint move abnormally. Arthritis can lead to the problem. A type that affects your spine , called ankylosing spondylitis , can damage the SI joint. You'll also hurt when the cartilage over the SI joint slowly wears away as you age. SI joint pain may also start if you're pregnant. Your body releases hormones that cause your joints to loosen up and move more, which leads to changes in the way the joints move. How Can I Get Relief? You have many choices for treatment. The first step is simply to stop the things that make you hurt. Your doctor will tell you to lay off any sports that inflame your joint. They may also prescribe some pain drugs. Some other ways to feel better: Physical therapy . Exercises can improve strength and make you more flexible. You'll learn to correct any habits you might have picked up when you were trying to avoid pain, like walking with a limp or leaning to one side. Your therapist may try ultrasound , heat and cold treatments, massage , and stretching . Injections. You may get a shot of cortisone to cut down the inflammation in your joint. If that doesn’t help, your doctor may numb the nerves around your SI joint to give you relief. Your doctor might also inject a solution of saline and numbing drugs into your joint. You may hear them call this ""prolotherapy."" It's thought to help tighten loose ligaments, if that's the cause of your SI joint problem. Chiropractic treatment. Adjustments by a chiropractor can help relieve pain. They'll use techniques that move your muscles and joints. Nerve treatment. Your doctor may use a needle to permanently damage the nerve that sends pain signals from your SI joint to your brain . They may also freeze it with an injection, though that technique isn't used much. What If I Don't Get Any Relief? These treatments usually reduce the inflammation and pain in your joint. But in rare cases, if you're still hurting, your doctor may recommend surgery. In an operation called SI joint fusion, a surgeon uses pins and implants to join the bones near the joint."
2,Seasonal Depression (Seasonal Affective Disorder),"Do the winter months get you down more than you think they should? If so, you might have seasonal depression , also known as seasonal affective disorder (SAD). Seasonal depression is a mood disorder that happens every year at the same time. A rare form of seasonal depression, known as ""summer depression ,"" begins in late spring or early summer and ends in fall. In general, though, seasonal affective disorder starts in fall or winter and ends in spring or early summer. SAD may affect 11 million people in the U.S. each year, and 25 million more may have a milder form called the winter blues. Causes While we don't know the exact causes of SAD, some scientists think that certain hormones made deep in the brain trigger attitude-related changes at certain times of year. Experts believe that SAD may be related to these hormonal changes. One theory is that less sunlight during fall and winter leads to the brain making less serotonin, a chemical linked to brain pathways that regulate mood. When nerve cell pathways in the brain that regulate mood don't work the way they should, the result can be feelings of depression , along with symptoms of fatigue and weight gain . SAD usually starts in young adulthood and is more common in women than men. Some people with SAD have mild symptoms and feel out of sorts or cranky. Others have worse symptoms that interfere with relationships and work. Because the lack of enough daylight during wintertime is related to SAD, it's less often found in countries where there's plenty of sunshine year-round. Winter Symptoms People with SAD typically sleep much more than usual and crave carbohydrates. They also have many of the normal warning signs of depression , including: Feeling sad, cranky, or hopeless Less energy Trouble concentrating Fatigue Greater appetite More desire to be alone Thoughts of suicide Weight gain Summer Symptoms Less appetite Trouble sleeping Weight loss Diagnosis The main feature of SAD is that your mood and behavior shift along with the calendar. It’s not a separate mood disorder but a type of major depression or bipolar disorder , sometimes called manic depression . You may have SAD if, for the past 2 years, you: Had depression or mania that starts as well as ends during a specific season You didn’t feel these symptoms during your “normal” seasons Over your lifetime, you’ve had more seasons with than without depression or mania It sometimes might take a while to diagnose SAD because it can mimic other conditions, like chronic fatigue syndrome , underactive thyroid , low blood sugar , viral illnesses, or other mood disorders. Treatment Treatments differ, depending on how severe your symptoms are. The type of treatment you get also depends on whether you have another type of depression or bipolar disorder. Traditional antidepressants are often used to treat seasonal depression. Bupropion XL is currently the only medication that is FDA-approved specifically to prevent major depressive episodes in people with SAD. Many doctors recommend that people with SAD get outside early in the morning to get more natural light. If this is impossible because of the dark winter months, antidepressant medications or light therapy (phototherapy) may help. Low levels of vitamin D, caused by low dietary intake of the vitamin or not enough exposure to sunshine, have been found in people with SAD. However, it's unclear whether vitamin D supplementation can help to relieve SAD symptoms. Very little research has been done on dietary supplements other than vitamin D for SAD. Light Therapy Some researchers link seasonal depression to the natural hormone melatonin , which causes drowsiness. Light affects the biological clock in our brains that regulates circadian rhythms, a physiological function that may include mood changes when there’s less sunlight in winter. Natural or ""full-spectrum"" light can have an antidepressant effect. A full-spectrum bright light shines indirectly into your eyes . You sit about 2 feet away from a bright light -- about 20 times brighter than normal room lighting. The therapy starts with one 10- to 15-minute session per day. Then the times increase to 30 to 45 minutes a day, depending on your response. Don't look directly at the light source of any light box for long times, to avoid possible damage to your eyes . Some people with SAD recover within days of using light therapy. Others take much longer. If the SAD symptoms don't go away, your doctor may increase the light therapy sessions to twice daily. People who respond to light therapy are encouraged to continue it until they can be out in the sunshine again in the springtime. While side effects are minimal, be cautious if you have sensitive skin or a history of bipolar disorder . Prevention Spend some time outside every day, even when it's cloudy. The effects of daylight still help. If it’s too cold out, open your blinds and sit by a sunny window. Begin using a 10,000-lux light box when fall starts, even before you feel the effects of winter SAD. Eat a well- balanced diet . This will help you have more energy, even if you're craving starchy and sweet foods. Exercise for 30 minutes a day, five times a week. Stay involved with your social circle and regular activities. Social support is very important. When Should I Call my Doctor? If you feel depressed, fatigued, and cranky the same time each year, and these feelings seem to be seasonal in nature, you may have a form of SAD. Talk openly with your doctor about your feelings. Follow their recommendations for lifestyle changes and treatment. If your doctor recommends light therapy, ask if the practice provides light boxes for patients with SAD. You can also rent or purchase a light box, but they're expensive, and health insurance companies don't usually cover them."
3,"SAM-e (S-adenosylmethionine,  SAMe)","SAM-e is a compound that's made naturally in the body and plays an important role in normal bodily function. A synthesized form of SAM-e is considered a supplement in the U.S., but SAM-e has been sold as a prescription drug in parts of Europe for decades. Its scientific name is S-adenosylmethionine. SAM-e is also known as ademetionine and SAMe. Why do people take SAM-e? SAM-e has some evidence as a treatment for osteoarthritis pain. Some studies have found that oral SAM-e is as effective as NSAID painkillers, such as ibuprofen and Celebrex . SAM-e takes longer to act than drugs do, but it also has fewer side effects than NSAIDs . SAM-e has also been used to treat depression for many years. Some studies have found that SAM-e might work as well as tricyclic antidepressants in relieving symptoms. However, many of these studies were flawed or too small to be conclusive. Other uses of SAM-e have not been studied as thoroughly. There's some evidence that SAM-e might help ease the pain of fibromyalgia and spinal cord damage caused by HIV . SAM-e may also help control cholestasis -- a buildup of bile in the liver -- particularly in pregnant women during the third trimester . One trial suggested that SAM-e might be helpful for adults with ADHD . However, more research needs to be done. Some people use SAM-e as a treatment for other conditions, such as liver disease, Alzheimer's disease, pain, migraine , and bursitis . We don't know the potential risks or benefits of these uses. How much SAM-e should you take? There is no established ideal dose of SAM-e. For depression , many studies have started patients at 400 to 600 milligrams daily. For osteoarthritis, 600-1,200 milligrams daily of SAM-e divided into three doses is common. Ask your doctor for advice. Sometimes, the dose of SAM-e is increased gradually over a few weeks. This can help reduce side effects such as restlessness or anxiety. Can you get SAM-e naturally from foods? There are no food sources of SAM-e. What are the risks of taking SAM-e? Side effects. SAM-e seems to be a relatively safe drug. High doses of oral SAM-e can cause symptoms like gas, upset stomach , diarrhea , constipation , dry mouth , headache , dizziness , anxiety, and skin rashes . SAM-e can also trigger an allergic reaction in some people. Risks. If you have any medical issues, check with a doctor before you start using SAM-e supplements . SAM-e might not be safe for people with conditions such as bipolar disorder, Parkinson's disease, and diabetes. Because SAM-e can affect the blood vessels, stop using SAM-e two weeks before getting surgery. Interactions. If you take any medicines regularly, talk to your doctor before you start using SAM-e supplements. SAM-e could be dangerous when combined with antidepressants or supplements that treat depression , like St. John's wort. SAM-e could also interact with some prescription painkillers, cough medicines, and treatments for diabetes and Parkinson's disease. Patients taking MAOIs should not use SAM-e without discussing it with their doctor. Given the lack of evidence about safety, SAM-e is not recommended for children or for women who are breastfeeding . Although SAM-e has been studied as a treatment for liver problems during pregnancy, pregnant women should only use SAM-e if a doctor recommends it."
4,What You Should Know About Food Poisoning,"If you’ve ever had food poisoning, you probably had a good idea that’s what it was even before you talked to your doctor. It’s hard to miss the main symptoms: stomach cramps, vomiting , and diarrhea . They can hit a few hours or a day or two after you eat the food that caused the problem. Your symptoms usually pass in a few days or even in mere hours. But if your discomfort doesn’t go away, you may need to get checked and find out exactly what made you sick. You should also see a doctor if along with other symptoms you have high fever , blood in your stool, or feel dehydrated or unable to keep any food or liquid down. Your doctor may be able to tell you what caused it after running tests. But they aren’t always necessary and don’t confirm every case. Do I Have Food Poisoning? Many times, your doctor will diagnose food poisoning based simply on your symptoms. While the main symptoms are nausea , diarrhea, vomiting, and stomach cramps, you also may have a fever, headache , muscle and joint aches, or blood in your stool. You may also be dehydrated, so your mouth and throat feel dry and you don’t pee as often as you typically do. Dehydration can make you dizzy when you stand up. Rarely, food poisoning can cause blurry or double vision , tingling, or weakness. More than 250 bacteria, viruses, and parasites are known to cause food poisoning. They can exist in foods at any stage, such as when they're growing, packaged, shipped, stored, or cooked. Certain foods are more likely to harbor bad germs. These include raw eggs, unpasteurized milk and juice, soft cheeses, and raw or undercooked meat or seafood. Fresh produce is another risk. Foods made in bulk are problematic, too. A single bad egg could affect the whole batch of omelets in a buffet. You could make trouble for yourself by not washing the cutting board or your hands as you prepare different foods. Your chances of getting food poisoning are higher in the summer. In 90-degree heat, food can start to spoil within an hour. At a picnic or during a camping trip, you are more likely to eat undercooked grilled meats or to handle raw meat without access to soap and water. Bacteria can grow quickly inside tepid coolers. So if you're picnicking on a hot day, put leftovers back in with fresh ice. Common Causes In 4 out of 5 cases of food poisoning, you never find out exactly what caused it. That's OK because you most likely will get better on your own. But in cases where the culprit is found, it's usually one of the following: Norovirus , often called stomach flu , is behind more than half of the foodborne illnesses in the U.S. where the cause is known. Norovirus can sicken you not only through eating contaminated foods, but also through touching doorknobs and other surfaces or having contact with an infected person. You should wipe down the kitchen if someone in your house has it. It typically takes 12-48 hours before you feel sick. Your symptoms may last 1-3 days. Salmonella is the name of a group of bacteria. They grow in undercooked eggs and meat. But you can also get salmonella from unpasteurized milk or cheese. Some fruits and vegetables, such as melons or sprouts, can also cause it. Symptoms start within 1-3 days and can last up to a week. Clostridium perfringens are bacteria that are more likely to show up when foods are prepared in bulk, such as in cafeterias or nursing homes or for catered events. Cooking kills the bacteria but not its spores. So food left warming can grow new germs. You can get it from beef, chicken, or gravy. You may have cramps and diarrhea but no other symptoms. You get sick within 6-24 hours and are usually feeling better in a couple of days. Campylobacter comes from undercooked poultry, unpasteurized milk, and sometimes water. It may take 2-5 days to develop symptoms you can notice. But you should feel better in another 2-10 days. You can't pass it to anyone. But if it's serious, you might have bloody diarrhea. More Serious Causes Some bacteria cause fewer cases of food poisoning but can make you very sick. They can even cause death. They include: E. coli , a type of bacteria found in the intestines of animals. You can get this from undercooked ground beef, unpasteurized milk, sprouts, or any food or liquid that has had contact with animal feces or sewage. Some strains are harmless. Others can make you very sick. Listeria is an unusual bacteria that can grow in cold temperatures such as in the refrigerator. It's found in smoked fish, raw (unpasteurized) cheeses, ice cream, pates, hot dogs, and deli meats. Typically, symptoms start within 24 hours of eating the product and you have short-lived gastroenteritis with watery diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and sometimes fever. That said, it can be much more serious in older people, pregnant women, or those with weakened immune systems. The bacteria can enter the bloodstream and central nervous system and cause an infection called listeriosis. This usually happens within 10 days to a month after exposure. In addition to diarrhea and vomiting, listeria can cause unusual symptoms, including weakness, confusion, and a stiff neck. It can also be deadly. If you have any of these symptoms, call your doctor right away. Tests for Food Poisoning If your illness is severe or complicated, your doctor may run some of the following tests. Stool cultures are the most common lab test for food poisoning . Your doctor may order one if you have a fever, ntense stomach pain , or bloody diarrhea, or if there is an outbreak that is being tracked. They may also order one if you have symptoms that linger. A sample of your stool can help tell if your sickness is related to bacteria. It can even reveal the germ’s DNA “fingerprint” and which antibiotics will kill it. Viruses are more difficult to see in culture,  so if the specific virus needs to be identified, your doctor may order stool tests to look for the germ's DNA fingerprint.Microscopic exams of stool can identify parasites. Stool tests aren’t always accurate, and they can take several days to come back. Blood tests may be ordered if your doctor thinks the infection has spread into the blood. Blood tests can detect the bacteria Listeria monocytogenes and the hepatitis A virus. Specific blood tests can tell how sick you are by looking for inflammation and signs that you’re dehydrated. Stool or blood tests can check for toxins, such as for botulism, which can be deadly. Imaging tests such as MRIs and CT scans aren’t often used in food poisoning cases. But they can help rule out other causes for your symptoms. Could It Be Something Else? A host of other conditions can lead to many of the same symptoms of food poisoning . Most common is mon-foodborne gastroenteritis , which is most often caused by a virus. For instance, Norovirus causes both foodborne gastroenteritis (from contaminated food or water) and viral gastroenteritis from person to person spread. Other causes include gallbladder problems , pancreatitis , and inflammatory bowel disease . So figuring out if you have food poisoning is as much about the timing as it is about the symptoms themselves. Delayed Symptoms In most cases, food poisoning usually shows up hours or days after you’ve eaten something that made you sick.  That can make it hard to know if it's food poisoning or something else. The delay also makes it tricky to trace the illness back to the specific food or drink. But different organisms work at different speeds. For example, Staphylococcus aureus can give you cramps, diarrhea, and nausea in as little as 30 minutes after you eat or drink. This bacterium grows in meats, eggs , and cream that haven’t been refrigerated properly. Another, far less common, cause of foodborne illness is the hepatitis A virus. It can lie in wait as long as 50 days before making itself known. You can get the virus through foods and drinks that have been in contact with sewage water. You’re more likely to get the virus when traveling in developing countries. Food Poisoning Treatment Call 911 if you think the food poisoning may be from seafood or wild mushrooms, or if the person is severely dehydrated. First, control n ausea and vomiting : Avoid solid foods until vomiting ends. Then eat light, bland foods, such as saltine crackers, bananas, rice, or bread. Sipping liquids may help avoid vomiting. Don’t eat fried, greasy, spicy, or sweet foods. Don’t take anti-nausea or anti- diarrhea medication without asking your doctor. They have side effects and may make some kinds of diarrhea worse. Your doctor may give you anti-nausea medication if you are at risk of being dehydrated. It’s important to prevent dehydration : Drink clear fluids, starting with small sips and gradually drinking more. If vomiting and diarrhea last more than 24 hours, drink an oral rehydration solution. Call a doctor right away if symptoms last more than 3 days or you have: Severe belly pain Fever Bloody diarrhea or dark stools Vomiting that is prolonged or bloody Signs of dehydration , such as dry mouth , decreased urination, dizziness , fatigue , or increased heart rate or breathing rate Food Poisoning Prevention Food safety for high-risk groups Food poisoning is more common and riskier for people with weakened immune systems, infants and young children, pregnant women, and the elderly. If you fall into one of these groups, try to avoid: Sushi and other raw seafoods and partly cooked shellfish like mussels, clams, and scallops. Refrigerated smoked seafood. These usually have labels that say “Nova-style,” “lox,” “kippered,” “jerky,” or “smoked.” Smoked seafood should be safe if you cook it well or if it has been canned or stored on a shelf. Unpasteurized juice and cider, including fresh-squeezed. These drinks can be safe if you boil them for 1 minute. Soft cheeses (Brie and Camembert), blue-veined cheeses (Roquefort) and Mexican-style cheeses (queso blanco, queso fresco, Panela). These are often made from unpasteurized milk, especially when they’re sold at farmer’s markets. Feta is also often made with raw milk. Stick with hard cheeses like cheddar or Swiss. Raw or partly cooked eggs. That means staying away from cookie and cake batter (not even a lick of the spoon). Same for homemade eggnog, tiramisu, Caesar dressing, hollandaise sauce, and ice cream . If you buy one of these products at the store, check the label to make sure it doesn’t contain raw eggs. At home, cook eggs until the yolk is hard. Raw or undercooked sprouts such as alfalfa, clover, mung beans, and radishes. Premade salads from the deli that contain meat or seafood. Canned versions are safe. Pâtés or meat spreads that have been refrigerated (they may be unpasteurized). Hot dogs, cold cuts, and luncheon and deli meats, even if they’re labeled cooked. Eat them only after you’ve reheated them steaming hot. Make sure no juices from these products end up on your hands or on plates, utensils, or counters. Food safety in the grocery store Before you load items into the shopping cart: Check the ingredients for unpasteurized milk or raw eggs. Make sure the “sell by” date hasn’t passed. Don’t buy food in dented or bulging cans or in damaged packaging. Pick up meat, poultry, and seafood just before you check out to limit the time they go unrefrigerated. Wrap meats in separate plastic bags so they don’t touch other items. Go directly home after you buy your food, and put away refrigerated items right away. Food safety in the kitchen These tips will help make your home-cooked meals safe: Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Also wash hands during cooking and preparations if you switch from one food to another. Keep countertops clean. Rinse all fruits and vegetables , even if you’re not going to eat the skin. Don’t let raw meat, poultry, seafood, and eggs come into contact with other foods on cutting boards, countertops, utensils, and other surfaces. Don’t touch any foods if you have symptoms of food poisoning . Wash cutting boards and knives with antibacterial soap and warm to hot water after handling raw meat, poultry, seafood, or eggs. Wooden cutting boards are not recommended because they can be harder to clean. Do not thaw foods at room temperature. Thaw foods in the refrigerator, and use them promptly. Do not refreeze foods if they have been thawed all the way. Don’t set out eggs, meats, poultry, seafood, or milk at room temperature for long. Cooking kills bacteria. Use a thermometer to make sure meats are cooked to safe temperatures. For beef and pork, it’s 145 F. For poultry, it’s 165 F. Keep your fridge temperature below 40 F and your freezer at 0 F. Food safety while eating out You have more control over the safety of  foods cooked at home than in a restaurant. But you can still take some safe steps when eating out: Choose where you eat carefully. If the restaurant looks dirty to you, it could be a sign that it isn’t handling or serving food properly. People who eat often at fast-food restaurants are more likely to report stomach issues than those who don’t visit as often. Check with your local health department’s restaurant inspection reports. Some states and cities require restaurants to post their health ratings in a visible spot. Always ask for your hamburger or other ground meat well done. For whole steak, roast, or a chop, medium rare (145 F) can be safe. Raw-meat dishes like steak tartare are risky. Make sure there are no raw or undercooked eggs in anything you order. If you take home food, put it in the fridge within 2 hours of leaving the restaurant. If it’s above 90 F outside, make that 1 hour. Food safety while traveling Who doesn’t love a vacation? But you need to be careful when you travel, especially to developing countries. Eat packaged or dry foods. Many of the bugs that cause food poisoning prefer moisture. Dry foods such as bread or chips or factory-sealed foods such as tuna are usually a safe bet. Go for bottled, canned, or hot drinks. Carbonated drinks are a good choice, because the bubbles will tell you it’s been sealed properly. You should be good with coffee or tea if it arrives steaming hot. Avoid raw food, local wild game, and tap water and ice in developing countries. Other safety tips Breastfeed your baby if possible. Mother's milk is the safest food for young infants. Breastfeeding may prevent many foodborne illnesses and other health problems. Wash your hands with soap after handling reptiles, turtles, birds, or after contact with human or pet feces. If you have diarrhea or vomiting , do not prepare food for others, especially people in high-risk groups. Always wash your hands before preparing food or eating. Always wash your hands after using the toilet, changing diapers , or coughing or sneezing ."
5,Your Guide to Sexually Transmitted Diseases,"Sexually transmitted diseases , commonly called STDs, are diseases that are spread by having sex with someone who has an STD. You can get a sexually transmitted disease from sexual activity that involves the mouth , anus , vagina , or penis . According to the American Social Health Association, 1 out of 4 teens in the United States become infected with an STD each year. By the age of 25, half of all sexually active young adults will get an STD. STDs are serious illnesses that require treatment. Some STDs, like HIV , can't be cured and are deadly. By learning more, you can find out ways to protect yourself from the following STDs. Genital herpes Human papilloma virus/Genital warts Hepatitis B Chlamydia Syphilis Gonorrhea (""Clap"") Molluscum contagiosum Pubic lice Trichomoniasis (Trich) STD Causes and Risk Factors Three things cause sexually transmitted diseases: Parasites Bacteria Viruses If you're sexually active, there's a chance that you can catch an STD. That chance can go up if you: Have unprotected sex Use condoms incorrectly Have sex with multiple partners Misuse alcohol or recreational drugs Inject drugs Symptoms of STDs Sometimes there are no symptoms of STDs. If you have symptoms, they may include one or more of the following: Bumps, sores, or warts near the mouth , anus, penis , or vagina Swelling or redness near the penis or vagina Skin rash Painful or swollen testicles Lower abdominal pain Fever Painful urination Weight loss , loose stools, night sweats Aches, pains, fever, and chills Yellowing of the skin ( jaundice ) Discharge from the penis or vagina. Vaginal discharge may have an odor. Bleeding from the vagina other than during a monthly period Painful sex Severe itching near the penis or vagina STD Diagnosis and Tests Your doctor can examine you and do tests to find out if you have an STD. If you have symptoms, you may get blood , urine , or fluid tests to figure out why you have them. If you don't have symptoms, your doctor might order different screening tests, depending on your age and health. You may have ones for: Chlamydia HIV Hepatitis B Hepatitis C Gonorrhea Human papillomavirus ( HPV ) Syphilis STD Treatment Treatment can: Cure many STDs Lessen the symptoms of STDs Make it less likely that you will spread the disease Help you to get healthy and stay healthy Many STDs are treated with antibiotics . If you are given an antibiotic to treat an STD, it's important that you take all of the drug, even if the symptoms go away. Also, never take someone else's medicine to treat your illness. By doing so, you may make it more difficult to diagnose and treat the infection. Likewise, you should not share your medicine with others. Some doctors, however, may provide additional antibiotics to be given to your partner so that both of you can be treated at the same time. STD Prevention STDs are preventable. There are several things that can protect yourself from them. Use a latex condom every time you have sex. (If you use a lubricant, make sure it is water-based.) Make sure to: Check the expiration date. Put your condom on before you have sex. Make sure to check for any tears. Store condoms in a cool, dry place. Limit your number of sexual partners. The more you have, the more likely you are to catch an STD. Choose your sex partners with care. Don't have sex with someone whom you suspect may have an STD. And keep in mind that you can't always tell by looking if your partner has an STD. Talk with your partners about STDs and how to be safe before you have sex. Get checked for STDs. Don't risk giving the infection to someone else. Don't use alcohol or drugs before you have sex. You may be less likely to use a condom if you are drunk or high. Know the symptoms of STDs. Look for them in yourself and your sex partners. Learn about STDs. The more you know, the better you can protect yourself. Get vaccinated. The HPV vaccine is safe and effective. It can also help prevent genital warts and some forms of cancer . Everyone through the age of 26 should get it. Not having sex or sexual relations (abstinence) is the only sure way to prevent STDs. How Can I Avoid Spreading an STD? If you have an STD, stop having sex until you see a doctor and are treated. Follow your doctor's instructions for treatment. Use condoms whenever you have sex, especially with new partners. Don't resume having sex unless your doctor says it's OK. Return to your doctor to get rechecked. Be sure your sex partner or partners also are treated."
6,Blood Thinner Basics,"Blood thinners are medicines that help blood flow smoothly through your veins and arteries. They keep blood clots from forming or getting bigger. They’re used to treat some types of heart disease and heart defects, along with other conditions that could raise your risk of forming dangerous clots. These drugs help protect against heart attacks and strokes. But they also come with risks: For example, they’ll cause you to bleed more than usual if you cut yourself. The lifesaving benefits of these drugs often outweigh the potential dangers. But it's important to learn about both before you start taking them. Types of Blood Thinners There are two. The first is called anticoagulants. These keep your blood from clotting or turning into solid clumps of cells that stick together. Most come in pill form, but some are given as a shot or as an IV through one of your veins. Some of the more widely known anticoagulants include: Apixaban ( Eliquis ) Dabigatran ( Pradaxa ) Dalteparin ( Fragmin ) Edoxaban ( Savaysa ) Enoxaparin ( Lovenox ) Fondaparinux ( Arixtra ) Heparin (I nnohep ) Rivaroxaban ( Xarelto ) Warfarin (C oumadin , Jantoven ) The second class of blood thinners is called antiplatelets. These target tiny particles in the blood called platelets. They come in pill form and include: Aspirin Cilostazol Clopidogre l ( Plavix ) Dipyridamole ( Persantine ) Eptifibatide (Integrilin) Prasugrel ( Effient ) Ticagrelor ( Brilinta ) Tirofiban (Aggrastat) Vorapaxar (Z ontivity ) How Blood Thinners Work Blood thinners don’t actually make your blood thinner. Nor can they break up clots. But they do keep new clots from forming. They can also slow the growth of existing ones. Some anticoagulants do this by competing with vitamin K from the liver. Your body needs this to make proteins called clotting factors. These help blood cells and platelets (tiny pieces of blood cells) bind together. Antiplatelets keep platelets from sticking to each other and to the walls of blood vessels, forming clots. These drugs are weaker than anticoagulants. They’re often prescribed to people at risk for future blood clots, rather than to treat existing ones. Who Needs Blood Thinners? About 2 million to 3 million people take blood thinners every year. You may need them if you’ve already had a heart attack or a stroke, since they can lower your risk of having a second one. You may also need blood thinners if you have a heart or blood vessel disease, an irregular heart rhythm, lupus, or deep vein thrombosis (DVT). That’s a dangerous type of blood clot that often forms in the leg. Your risk of getting blood clots is also higher if you’re overweight, you’ve recently had surgery, or you have an artificial heart valve. Some people only need blood thinners for a few months. But if you have ongoing health problems, you may need to take them long-term. Side Effects of Blood Thinners Clotting isn't always a bad thing. When you cut yourself, that’s what seals your wound and keeps you from losing too much blood. But blood thinners prevent clotting. So even tiny cuts or bruises will bleed a lot more if you take these drugs. You should be very careful when taking part in activities that could cause any type of injury. Call your doctor right away if you fall or hit your head. Even if you don't tear your skin, you could bleed internally. Let your doctor know right away if you notice any signs of unusual bleeding, like: Heavier-than-normal menstrual periods Blood in your pee or poop Bleeding from your gums or nose Vomiting or coughing up blood Dizziness Weaknesses A severe headache or stomachache You may lose bone strength if you take heparin for a long time. This raises your chances of breaking a bone. Another serious, but less common, side effect of warfarin is necrosis. That’s when your skin starts to die. If you take an anticoagulant like warfarin, you'll need regular blood tests so your doctor can adjust your levels if needed. Ask them about other steps you should take to stay safe while you're on this medication. If you get a dangerous bleeding problem while taking warfarin, doctors can turn to an ""antidote"" of vitamin K or a combination of prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) and fresh frozen plasma to stop it. In addition, approval has been given for using a reversal agent like andexanet alfa (Andexxa) to reverse the anti-clotting effects of apixaban (Eliquis) and rivaroxaban (Xarelto), or idarucizumab (Praxbind) to reverse the anti-clotting effects of dabigatran etexilate (Pradaxa) in emergencies. Other medicines and supplements , including over-the-counter ones, can interfere with these drugs. Tell all of your doctors, including your dentist, that you’re taking a blood thinner. Don’t start any new medicines without their OK. And remember that what you eat is also very important. Some foods – like green, leafy vegetables – contain vitamin K. This can counteract blood thinners. Ask your doctor if you’re not sure a certain food or drink is safe. How to Manage Side Effects Get your blood checked often if you’re on warfarin or heparin. This is an international normalized ratio (INR) test. It tells you how long it takes your blood to clot. You can also try to stop uncontrollable bleeding before it starts. Here are a few tips: Use a soft toothbrush and waxed dental floss. Use an electric razor. Don’t trim corns or calluses. Wear gloves when you do yard work or use sharp tools. Wear a helmet when bike riding. Do low-impact sports like walking or swimming. Other tips include: Pay attention to how much vitamin K you’re getting. It helps your blood clot. But too much can stop warfarin from working. Talk to your doctor to find the right balance. Don’t drink too much alcohol. This raises your risk of bleeding. One to two drinks a day is a safe amount. Tell people you’re on a blood thinner. Wear a medical alert bracelet or carry a card with your medications on it. Make sure your doctor, dentist, and other health care providers know. Tell them if you also take herbal supplements or vitamins. When to Call Your Doctor Call your doctor right away if you have any of these symptoms. You may have a blood clot. They include: Blurred vision Chest pain Severe weakness or dizziness Tingly hands, feet, or face Can’t move Swollen or red arms, calves, or feet Blood Thinners and Pregnancy Some are considered safe to take during pregnancy. Others aren’t. Talk to your doctor if you’re on blood thinners and thinking about having a baby. They’ll let you know the next steps. If you’re already pregnant, double check with your doctor to make sure the blood thinner you’re on won’t harm the baby ."
7,Baby Safety,"Your child's safety is your responsibility. The following tips should help you keep your baby out of harm's way from birth through their toddler years. Baby Safety in the Car Always use a federally approved car safety seat when traveling in a motor vehicle. Carefully read safety seat instructions, as well as instructions in your car's owner's manual, to ensure that the seat has been properly installed. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends buying a new car seat unless you’re sure a used seat has never been in an accident. NEVER carry your infant in your lap while you ride in a car. For the first 2 years of a baby's life, car seats should face the rear of the vehicle. The safest location for the car seat is the middle of the back seat. NEVER put the baby in the front passenger seat of cars, especially those with airbags. If you have a truck with no back seat, you should disengage the airbag while the baby's seat is in the car. Check the height and weight limits on your child’s car seat from time to time to be sure they haven’t outgrown it. You’ll also need to adjust the position of the harness straps as your baby gets bigger. If you have questions about safety seats, call the Auto Safety Hotline at 888-327-4236 (888-DASH-2-DOT). Or visit an NHTSA car seat inspection station . Often, they're located at fire stations. A certified technician will show you how to properly install and use your car seat. To minimize the risk that a child will accidentally be left behind in a car or get trapped inside: Leave a purse, briefcase, shoe, or cell phone in the back seat. That way, you get in the habit of checking in the back seat before leaving the vehicle. Make an arrangement with your child’s day care to have them call you if the child doesn’t show up as expected. Always lock your car and car trunk, even if the car is parked in the driveway at home, and always keep keys out of the reach of little ones. Preventing Baby Falls If you use an infant carrier, always place it on the floor, never on a counter or tabletop. Make sure the baby is always strapped in. Never leave your baby alone on a bed, couch, changing table, or infant seat from which they can fall or roll off. Even if looking away for a second, an accident can happen. Baby Safety, Smoking and Fire Safety Do not smoke and do not allow smoking around your baby. Even smoking “outside” is harmful for the baby because clothing, hair and skin still carry smoke particles. Install a working smoke alarm on every level of your home. Change the batteries of your smoke detectors every 6 months. Have at least one fire extinguisher on every level of your home. If your home uses gas heat, install a carbon monoxide detector. Preventing Baby Burns Do not hold hot liquids while holding your baby. To prevent burns, do not microwave your baby's bottle. Many microwaves heat unevenly, creating ""hot spots"" in your baby's formula that can burn your baby's mouth. Instead, warm the formula by running warm tap water over the bottle or submerging the bottle in a bowl of warm water. Shake the bottle well. Make sure you test the temperature on your hand or wrist before feeding it to your baby. Keep your hot water heater's thermostat at no higher than 120 degrees F. Consider installing anti-scald devices on faucets and shower heads. Preventing Baby Accidents Keep sharp objects (knives, scissors, tools, razors) and other hazardous items (coins, glass objects, beads, pins, medications ) in a secure place out of your baby's reach. NEVER shake a baby or throw your baby in the air. This can cause brain damage or blindness. Do not leave your baby alone with a young sibling or a pet, even when your baby is sleeping. Never put your child in a walker. They send thousands of kids to the emergency room every year, mainly by causing falls down stairs. Make sure that your baby cannot pull lamps or other electrical objects on top of themselves. Use electrical tape to secure electrical cords along baseboards. Remove tablecloths that can be pulled from the table. Make sure all drawers have stops so that your baby or toddler can't pull the drawer out on top of themselves. Attach furniture to the wall so the pieces don’t fall over the child. Avoid electronics on top of higher dressers or tables that can fall on the child. Baby Bathing Safety Always test the bath water to make sure it is not too hot before setting your baby in the water. Dipping your elbow in the water is a good way to test. Turn down your water heater to 120 F. Never leave your baby unattended in the bathtub or bath ring. It only takes a few seconds for a baby to drown. Store small appliances, such as hair dryers and radios, away from the water and bathing areas. Keep these appliances unplugged and out of reach when not in use. Baby Toy Safety Inspect your child's toys often. Be sure that toys are unbreakable, do not come apart, do not have small parts that could be chewed or broken off, and are not sharp. The pieces/toys should be larger than your baby's mouth . Use toy chests without lids or with supports that hold a lid open in any position. Be cautious with balloons to prevent choking. Baby Choking or Strangulation Prevention NEVER put strings or cords around your baby's neck (such as to hold a pacifier ) or near your baby's crib. Be cautious of strings or buttons on clothing; make sure they are not in danger of choking your baby. Secure cords on blinds and drapes out of reach to prevent accidental strangulation. Put away small objects -- even display items -- that can cause injury or choking if swallowed. Baby Feeding Safety Never prop up your baby's bottle and leave your baby unattended; your baby could choke. Do not put your baby to bed with a bottle. Avoid giving your child raw carrots, unpeeled apples, nuts, hard candies, and other foods that present a choking hazard. In a highchair, always use restraining straps that run around your child's waist and between their legs to keep them from sliding out. Baby Sleeping Safety All infants should be put down for sleep on their backs to reduce the risk for sudden infant death syndrome, also called SIDS. Give your baby a pacifier before they go to sleep . This reduces the chance of SIDS. Avoid soft bedding that might suffocate your baby, such as pillows, blankets, plush toys, and bumpers in the crib. Crib slats should be 2 3/8 inches apart or less so the baby’s head can't get trapped. Keep your baby's room at a moderate temperature and dress them in a way that they can't overheat. This also reduces the risk of SIDS. Share a bedroom with your newborn -- but not a bed. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that parents sleep in the same room, preferably for at least the first six months. Avoid devices marketed to reduce the risk of SIDS, such as sleep positioners. Nursing your baby and making sure that your baby gets all of the recommended vaccines can help protect against SIDS. Don’t nurse in a chair or on a couch if you feel you might fall asleep. If your baby falls asleep in a car seat, swing or carrier, try to remove them and lay them on a flat surface. Try to have skin-to-skin contact with your baby. Changing Table Safety Use a sturdy table. Always keep your hands and eyes on your baby while they are on the changing table. Keep supplies within easy reach. Babies and Pets Keep food and water bowls in an area your baby can’t reach. Same with the litterbox. Supervise your child’s interactions with your pets and teach them to be gentle. Hitting or tail-pulling can lead to bites and scratches. Don’t let your animals lick your baby’s face or skin, especially if they have a cut or scrape. Wash your child’s hands after they play with the dog or cat. Keep the pet toys out of your baby’s mouth. Most doctors say pets shouldn’t sleep in your child’s bed. Baby Crawling and Walking Safety When your baby becomes mobile, here are important tips to keep your baby safe around your home: Put electrical outlet covers on all outlets. Secure electrical cords to baseboards. Install safety gates securely in front of stairs and basement doors. Avoid gates with diamond-shaped slats, which provide footholds for climbing toddlers. Instead, use gates with straight, vertical slats, and a swinging door. Use doorknob covers to keep children away from rooms and other areas with hazards. Be careful, though, that these devices are easy for adults to use in case of emergency. Store cleaners and medications out of reach and in a locked cabinet, and always in their original containers. Never store toxic substances in bottles or jars that could be mistaken for food products. Install safety locks on cabinets. Turn pot and pan handles on the stove in and cook on the back burners whenever possible. Establish the area in front of the stove as off-limits while you are cooking. Keep the toilet lid down to prevent drowning and to keep the lid from slamming on your baby's head or hands. Consider installing toilet lid locks. Cushion hard edges and sharp corners of furniture. If possible, move sharp-edged pieces of furniture away from high traffic areas. Anchor down unsteady pieces of furniture, such as bookcases. Place furniture away from high windows so children won't climb onto windowsills. Screens aren't strong enough to keep children from falling through windows. Outdoor Safety If there is a swimming pool in your backyard or your neighborhood, make sure it is surrounded by a fence and has a gate that latches or locks. Better yet, never leave your child unattended when outdoors. Cover areas under and around backyard play sets with shock-absorbing material, such as sand, rubber, or mulch, 9-12 inches deep. During hot summer days, check the temperature of slides and swings. They can become hot enough to cause burns to the skin . Always supervise children on playground equipment. Watch for hazards like stair rungs where they can get stuck, missing guardrails, protruding bolts, or dangling ropes or cords. Teach your child to stay away from stray dogs and wild animals like squirrels and raccoons when you go to the park, and make sure they don’t get hold of animal droppings, which can carry germs. Keep your child away from moving machinery, including lawnmowers and overhead garage doors. Also, keep kids away from driveways and streets. Keep your baby in the shade, if possible. Their skin is thinner and more sensitive. Cover them up with clothes and a hat, limit their time in the sun (especially between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., when the sun is strongest), don’t let them get overheated, and get them out of the sun right away if they show any signs of sunburn or dehydration , including fussiness, redness, and excessive crying. Don’t put bug spray on babies younger than 2 months. Keep them inside when bugs are biting at dawn and dusk. Cover their skin with long sleeves and pants, and cover strollers with mesh netting. Get rid of standing water in your yard where mosquitoes breed, like planters and bird baths. After 2 months bug repellent is OK, but keep it off your baby’s hands and away from their mouth and eyes. Other Baby Safety Precautions Consider taking a certified CPR class if you are not already certified. You can find out about these classes from your local Red Cross or American Heart Association chapter. You may want to post a demonstration chart near your phone. Your baby's caregivers should be CPR-certified. Gather a list of emergency numbers and keep them by the phone. These numbers should include: your child's pediatrician, your health care provider, your family doctor, a 24-hour nurse-on-call number, the police department, the fire department, 911 reminder, and poison control. If a poison is swallowed, call the poison control center (throughout the USA, call 800-222-1222 -- American Association of Poison Control Centers.) Keep poisonous house plants out of reach. For information about which plants are poisonous, contact your local county extension office. Beware of any device that claims to help prevent SIDS. Home monitors, wedges and positioners remain unproven. Name a guardian for your child. In the unfortunate event that something happens to you or your spouse, it's a good idea to have a will that names a legal guardian and alternate guardian for your child. Without a will, the court may appoint a guardian you would not have chosen. Be sure to check with the individuals named in your will to make sure they are willing to serve as your child's guardian. In your will, you can also leave assets to your child in the form of a testamentary, or ""after death"" trust."
8,Salivary Gland Problems,"Your salivary glands make as much as a quart of saliva each day. Saliva is important to lubricate your mouth , help with swallowing, protect your teeth against bacteria, and aid in the digestion of food. The three major pairs of salivary glands are: parotid glands on the insides of the cheeks submandibular glands at the floor of the mouth sublingual glands under the tongue There are also several hundred minor salivary glands throughout the mouth and throat. Saliva drains into the mouth through small tubes called ducts. When there is a problem with the salivary glands or ducts, you may have symptoms such as salivary gland swelling , dry mouth , pain , fever , and foul-tasting drainage into the mouth. Causes of Salivary Gland Problems Many different problems can interfere with the function of the salivary glands or block the ducts so they can't drain saliva. The following are some of the more common salivary gland problems : Salivary stones, or sialoliths. The most common cause of swollen salivary glands , salivary stones are buildups of crystallized saliva deposits. Sometimes salivary stones can block the flow of saliva. When saliva can't exit through the ducts, it backs up into the gland, causing pain and swelling. Pain is usually off and on, is felt in one gland, and gets progressively worse. Unless the blockage is cleared, the gland is likely to become infected. Salivary gland infection , or sialadenitis. Bacterial infection of the salivary gland, most commonly the parotid gland, may result when the duct into the mouth is blocked. Sialadenitis creates a painful lump in the gland, and foul-tasting pus drains into the mouth. Sialadenitis is more common in older adults with salivary stones, but it can also happen in babies during the first few weeks after birth. If not treated, salivary gland infections can cause severe pain, high fevers , and abscess (pus collection). Infections. Viral infections such as mumps , flu , and others can cause swelling of the salivary glands. Swelling happens in parotid glands on both sides of the face, giving the appearance of ""chipmunk cheeks."" Salivary gland swelling is commonly associated with mumps , happening in about 30% to 40% of mumps infections. It usually begins approximately 48 hours after the start of other symptoms such as fever and headache . Other viral illnesses that cause salivary gland swelling include the Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ), cytomegalovirus ( CMV ), Coxsackievirus , and the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ). Bacterial infections generally cause one-sided salivary gland swelling. Other symptoms such as fever and pain will accompany the swelling. The bacteria are typically those found normally in the mouth, as well as staph bacteria. These infections most often affect the parotid gland. Dehydration and malnutrition raise the risk of getting a bacterial infection. Cysts . Cysts can develop in the salivary glands if injuries, infections, tumors, or salivary stones block the flow of saliva. Some babies are born with cysts in the parotid gland due to a problem with the development of the ears . It can appear as a blister or soft, raised area. Cysts may interfere with eating and speaking. Tumors. Several different types of tumors can affect the salivary glands. They can be cancerous (malignant) or noncancerous (benign). The two most common tumors are pleomorphic adenomas and Warthin's tumor. Pleomorphic adenomas most commonly affect the parotid glands, but can also affect the submandibular gland and minor salivary glands. The tumor is usually painless and grows slowly. Pleomorphic adenomas are benign (noncancerous) and are more common in women than men. Warthin's tumor is also benign and affects the parotid gland. Warthin's tumor can grow on both sides of the face and affects more men than women. While most salivary gland tumors are benign, some can be cancerous. Malignant tumors include mucoepidermoid carcinoma , adenoid cystic carcinoma, adenocarcinoma , low-grade polymorphous adenocarcinoma, and malignant mixed tumor. Sjögren's syndrome . This is a chronic autoimmune disease in which cells of a person's immune system attack the salivary and other moisture-producing glands, leading to dry mouth and eyes . About half of people with Sjögren's syndrome also have enlargement of the salivary glands on both sides of the mouth, which is usually painless. Treatment for Salivary Gland Problems Treatment for salivary gland problems depends on the cause. For stones and other blockages of the ducts, treatment often begins with measures such as manual removal of stones, warm compresses, or sour candies to increase the flow of saliva. If simple measures don't relieve the problem, surgery may be required to remove the blockage and/or the affected gland. Surgery is usually required to remove benign and malignant tumors. Some benign tumors are treated with radiation to keep them from coming back. Some cancerous tumors require radiation and chemotherapy . Surgery may also be needed to treat large cysts. Other problems may be treated with medications . For example, bacterial infections are treated with antibiotics . Medications can also be prescribed for dry mouth."
9,Salmonella (Salmonellosis),"What Is Salmonella? Salmonella is the type of bacteria that’s the most frequently reported cause of food-related illness in the United States. You can’t see, smell, or taste it. Illness from these bacteria is officially called salmonellosis. It can cause an upset stomach , diarrhea , fever , and pain and cramping in your belly. Most people get better on their own at home within 4 to 7 days. How Common Is Salmonella? Salmonella infections are very common. When people mention food poisoning , they’re usually talking about salmonella. Tens of millions of cases are reported around the world every year. In severe cases, you need to go to the hospital. Rarely, it can be life-threatening. Infections are more common in the summer than the winter. This is because salmonella grows quickly in higher temperatures, when food isn’t refrigerated. Salmonella Causes People and animals can carry salmonella in their intestines and their feces. The bacteria often spread through contaminated foods. Common food sources of salmonella infection include: Raw and undercooked meat, including chicken, turkey, duck, beef, veal, and pork Raw fruits or vegetables Unpasteurized milk and other dairy products, including soft cheese , ice cream , and yogurt Raw or undercooked eggs Processed foods like chicken nuggets and nut butters You can also get salmonella directly through: Poor handwashing . You might pass along the bacteria by not washing your hands well after using the bathroom or changing a diaper . Pets. Animals like dogs, cats, birds, and reptiles can carry the bacteria. Salmonella Risk Factors Children, especially those under 5, are more likely than adults to get sick from salmonella. Older adults and people with weak immune systems are also more likely to be infected. Other risk factors include: International travel. Salmonella is more common in places with poor sanitation. Taking certain drugs . Cancer drugs or steroids can weaken your immune system . Antacids lower how much acid is in your stomach , which makes it easier for salmonella to survive there. Antibiotics can kill “good” bacteria in your body and make an infection harder to fight. Inflammatory bowel disease . This can damage the lining of your intestines , making it easier for salmonella to take hold. Salmonella Poisoning Symptoms Most of the signs and symptoms of a salmonella infection are stomach -related. They include: Cramps in your stomach Bloody poop Diarrhea Cold and chills Fever Headache Upset stomach Throwing up Symptoms tend to start 8 to 72 hours after infection. Most symptoms usually don’t last more than a week, but it can take several months for your bowel movements to get back to normal. When should I call a doctor? See your doctor if you’re still having general symptoms more than a week after first getting the infection. A young child, an older adult, or someone who has a weakened immune system should see a doctor if they have any of these symptoms for more than a couple of days: Bloody poop Ongoing high fever Dehydration , when they’ve lost too much fluid. Signs include peeing only in small amounts, a dry mouth , and sunken eyes . Salmonella Complications You can become dehydrated if you don’t get enough fluids to replace what you lose because of diarrhea. A few people who get a salmonella infection also get pain in their joints. You might hear a doctor call it reactive arthritis or Reiter’s syndrome. It can last several months or longer. This condition can also cause pain while peeing and itchy, stinging, or sore eyes . If the salmonella infection gets into your blood , it can infect other parts of your body, including: The tissues around your brain and spinal cord The lining of your heart or heart valves Your bones or bone marrow The lining of your blood vessels Salmonella Diagnosis Your doctor may have you take blood tests, or they might ask for a sample of your poop. Sometimes, they may want to do testing to figure out the exact kind of bacteria you have. This can help health officials trace the source if there’s an outbreak in your area. Salmonella Treatment For healthy adults: If you have diarrhea, drink a lot of water and other fluids. Your doctor might suggest that you drink a rehydration liquid like Pedialyte or take a medication like loperamide ( Imodium ) if your diarrhea is severe. If your doctor confirms that you have a salmonella infection, they might prescribe antibiotics. Take them exactly as directed, and be sure to finish the prescription. For children: If your child has a healthy immune system , the doctor might just let the infection run its course. If they have a high fever, you may want to give acetaminophen . As with adults, they should drink lots of water . In special cases: Infants, the elderly, and people who have weakened immune systems may need antibiotics. Salmonella Prevention Salmonella can hide in a variety of foods, but you can do a lot of things to help ensure the bacteria stay away: Don’t eat raw or barely cooked eggs or meat. Don’t eat or drink anything with unpasteurized milk or juice. Don’t wash raw poultry, meat, or eggs before cooking. Wash raw fruits and vegetables well, and peel them if possible. Don’t prepare food for other people if you’re vomiting or have diarrhea. Refrigerate food properly, both before cooking it and after serving it. Wash your hands well with soap and warm water before and after handling food. Keep kitchen surfaces clean before preparing food on them. Don’t mix cooked food with raw food or use the same utensils to prepare them. For example, don’t use the same knife to cut raw chicken and then to slice mushrooms, and use different plates or cutting boards to slice them on. Cook meat to its correct minimum temperature. Use a food thermometer to be sure. Wash your hands with soap and water after touching animals, their toys, and their bedding."
10,Understanding Sarcoidosis -- the Basics,"What Is Sarcoidosis? Sarcoidosis is a chronic disease that can affect multiple organs -- eyes, joints, skin -- but lungs are involved in 95% of cases. The disease is characterized by the buildup of immune system cells in organs that form small clusters called granulomas, a type of inflammation of the involved tissues. While the disease can affect anybody, African-Americans have a lifetime risk of 2.4% for developing sarcoidosis, while whites have a risk of 0.85%. It occurs most commonly between the ages of 20 and 40, although it can occur in children, and there is a second peak, particularly in women, after age 50. Because the symptoms of sarcoidosis can be vague and may be mistaken for other diseases, it's difficult to estimate how common it is. In the U.S., an estimated 10 to 40 in 100,000 people have sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis is not cancer ; nor is it contagious. Although it can occur in families, it is not inherited. Usually the disease is not disabling; most people with sarcoidosis live normal lives. In fact, in the majority of cases, the disease appears only briefly and disappears on its own. About 20% to 30% of people with sarcoidosis are left with some permanent lung damage, and in 10% to 15% of patients the disease is chronic. Although it is rare, death from sarcoidosis can occur if the disease causes serious damage to vital organs, such as the brain , lungs, or heart . What Causes Sarcoidosis? Researchers believe sarcoidosis is associated with an abnormal immune system response, but what triggers this response is not known. Nor do doctors know whether heredity, environment, or lifestyle affects the development, severity, or length of the disease. These are questions that researchers are trying to answer."
11,Sarcoidosis,"What Is Sarcoidosis? Sarcoidosis is an inflammatory disease that can affect multiple organs in the body, but most often involves the lungs and lymph glands in the chest. If you have sarcoidosis, red, swollen lumps called granulomas form in your affected organs. Symptoms, which can range from non-existent to severe, depend partly on where the lumps form. Is sarcoidosis an autoimmune disease? Sarcoidosis does involve immune system activity, but it's not generally considered an autoimmune disease.  Autoimmunity means your immune system attacks parts of your body. However, researchers are continuing to study the idea that at least some cases of sarcoidosis involve autoimmunity. Is sarcoidosis cancer? Sarcoidosis is not cancer. In rare cases, doctors might mistake cancer for sarcoidosis, delaying proper diagnosis of the cancer. Sarcoidosis Symptoms The symptoms of sarcoidosis can vary greatly, depending in part on which organs are involved. In some people, symptoms may begin suddenly and and then stop. Others may have no outward symptoms. Still others may have symptoms that appear slowly and subtly, but which last or come back repeatedly over a long time span. General symptoms include: Fever Fatigue Swollen, painful joints Achy or weak muscles Swollen lymph nodes Unexplained weight loss Kidney stones Night sweats Lung sarcoidosis symptoms The lungs are usually the first area to be affected by sarcoidosis: 9 of 10 people with sarcoidosis have some type of lung (pulmonary) involvement. Pulmonary sarcoidosis can be serious, leading to scar tissue (fibrosis) in the lungs. This complication can interfere with breathing. If you have lung sarcoidosis, your symptoms might include: Cough Shortness of breath Wheezing Chest pain Skin sarcoidosis symptoms Sarcoidosis can cause changes on your skin, nails, and hair. Common symptoms include: Small bumps called papules on your neck or face, especially around your eyes. These are especially common in Black women and may be reddish brown, violet, tan, brown, or the same color as your skin. Raised patches that can be smooth or scaly. These may be reddish brown, purple, or brown. When patches form and heal on your scalp, they can cause hair loss. Firm bumps and patches. On darker skin, these patches and bumps may look darker or lighter than your skin tone. On lighter skin, they might look pink or red. Painless or slightly tender lumps under your skin, usually on your arms. A rash, often on your shins, sometimes along with a fever Changes around a tattoo, scar, or body piercing. You might see tiny bumps and the skin might feel lumpy, sore, or itchy. Discolored or deformed nails Cardiac sarcoidosis symptoms When granulomas grow in your heart tissue, they can affect how your heart works. This could lead to: Chest pain Shortness of breath Fluttering or irregular heartbeats Fainting Swelling in your legs from excess fluid Heart failure Eye sarcoidosis symptoms You might have signs of sarcoidosis in your eyes that will only show up on an eye exam. If you do have symptoms, they might include: Blurred vision Eye pain Dry eyes Burning or itching eyes Severe redness Light sensitivity Other symptoms If sarcoidosis affects your nervous system, it can cause a wide range of symptoms including loss of hearing, taste, and smell, dizziness, seizures, and mental health changes. Sarcoidosis can also affect the liver, your bones, or any other organ. Sarcoidosis Risk Factors Sarcoidosis is a rare disease, affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the United States. It can occur in people of any age, race, or gender, but is more common in some groups than others.  Risk factors include: Age: Sarcoidosis most often shows up between ages 25 and 40. Race: In the United States, sarcoidosis is most common among people of African descent. People of Scandinavian descent also have an increased risk. Gender: Sarcoidosis is slightly more common among those assigned female at birth than those assigned male. Environment: If you live or work around insecticides, molds, dust, or other substances that might trigger inflammation, you may face a higher risk. Farmers, firefighters, and autoworkers are in this group. Military veterans exposed to burn pits are too. Family history: If a close relative has sarcoidosis, your risk is higher. Medications: Risks are higher if you take certain drugs, including some used for HIV and cancer. Sarcoidosis Causes The exact cause of sarcoidosis is not known. Studies suggest that in some people, the inflammation that leads to symptoms is triggered by an infection or by exposure to something else in the environment, such as chemicals or dust. Sarcoidosis might also involve autoimmune responses, in which your immune system attacks your body's own proteins. Is sarcoidosis hereditary? Since your risk is higher if you have a close family member with the disease, scientists suspect that genes play a role. Genetic differences might explain why infections and other exposures trigger sarcoidosis in some people but not others. But scientists haven't discovered the gene or genes involved. Sarcoidosis Diagnosis Sarcoidosis can be hard to diagnose, partly because you might have no clear symptoms or your symptoms and test results may mimic those seen in other conditions. To start the process, your doctor will carefully review your medical history and examine you. The main tools your doctor will use to diagnose sarcoidosis include: Chest X-rays to look for granulomas and scarring in your lungs and heart. (Some people are diagnosed with sarcoidosis after a chest X-ray is done for some other reason). The X-ray can also help the doctor see how advanced any lung involvement is -- a process called staging. Other imaging tests , such as an MRI or ultrasound. These can  look for granulomas elsewhere in your body. Biopsies, which are tests in which small tissues samples are taken to check for signs of disease. You might get biopsies of your skin, lymph nodes, lungs, or other organs. If you need a lung or lymph node biopsy, your doctor may do a bronchoscopy, in which a lighted tube is passed down your throat to reach the target areas. Additional tests might be done to confirm the diagnosis or see how sarcoidosis is affecting your body. These could include: Lab tests of your blood and urine to show how your kidneys, liver, and other organs are working Lung function tests to see if you have any breathing problems Eye exams to look for signs of damage, even if you aren't having any eye symptoms Heart tests, including an electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG) to check the electrical activity in your heart Neurological tests to see if your nervous system is affected Imaging tests, such as a PET scan, that can show inflammation in your body Tuberculosis skin test to rule out TB, which is sometimes mistaken for sarcoidosis Sarcoidosis Treatment There is no cure for sarcoidosis, but the disease often gets better on its own over time. Many people with sarcoidosis have mild symptoms and don't need treatment. Treatment, when it is needed, can reduce symptoms and prevent organ damage. Sarcoidosis medications Your doctor may prescribe medications including: Corticosteroids. These drugs, like prednisone and cortisone, reduce inflammation. You might get them as pills, inhaled sprays, or creams, depending on which parts of your body are involved. These are the most common treatments for sarcoidosis. Side effects of steroid pills can include mood changes, weight gain, increased blood pressure, and increased blood sugar. Immunosuppressants. These drugs tamp down your immune system, reducing inflammation and organ damage. Methotrexate is an immunosuppressant drug often used for sarcoidosis. You take these drugs as pills or shots. Side effects can include liver damage or blood problems. Anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha antibodies (anti-TNF-alpha antibodies). These drugs target a specific immune system chemical. You get them through an intravenous (IV) treatment, meaning the drugs go through a needle into a vein. Side effects can include an increased risk of serious infection. Anti-malarial medications . Drugs commonly used to treat malaria, such as hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, also can reduce inflammation and are sometimes prescribed for sarcoidosis. You take them in pill form.  Side effects can include serious skin rashes and vision changes. In some cases, your doctor might recommend you take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) that you can buy without a prescription. These are drugs like aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen that can temporarily relieve symptoms like joint pain and fever. Long-term use can lead to heartburn, vomiting, and stomach bleeding, so you should always talk to your doctor before you start any regular NSAID use. Important to know: Some drugs prescribed for sarcoidosis aren't approved by the FDA for that use, so patients sometimes have trouble getting insurers to pay for them. Studies to expand the number of drugs rigorously tested and approved for sarcoidosis are underway. You can ask your doctor if participation in a clinical trial might be right for you. Other sarcoidosis treatments In addition to medication, some people will benefit from treatments including: Physical therapy to reduce fatigue and improve strength Pulmonary rehabilitation to improve breathing Implantation of a cardiac pacemaker or defibrillator for heart rhythm problems Organ transplant if sarcoidosis has severely damaged your heart, lungs, or liver Sarcoidosis Stages Your doctor may tell you that your disease is at a certain stage, between 0 and 4. These stages are based on how your lungs look on a chest X-ray. You can have serious symptoms at any stage, but doctors generally expect people at lower stages to have a higher chance of recovering completely, even without treatment. You can move between stages or not. These are the stages: Stage 0: No signs of sarcoidosis in your lungs or the lymph nodes in the center of your chest (though you may have signs elsewhere). Stage I: Granulomas in the lymph nodes only. You may have no symptoms or may have fevers, joint pains, and night sweats that developed suddenly. This combination of symptoms and lymph node involvement is called Lofgren syndrome and is the type of sarcoidosis most likely to go away on its own, usually within 6 months to 2 years. Stage II: Granulomas in the lungs and the lymph nodes. Stage III: Granulomas in the lung tissue only. Stage IV: Permanent scarring of lung tissue. This scarring can't be reversed. In addition to looking at the stage of any lung involvement, your doctor will consider which other organs might be involved to help you plan your treatment. Sarcoidosis Complications For most people, sarcoidosis is a temporary condition that goes away, with or without treatment, and without permanent damage. About two-thirds will recover within 2 to 3 years; those with Lofgren syndrome tend to get better even sooner. If you're still having symptoms after 3 years, you are more likely to keep having symptoms. About 10% to 20% of people with long-lasting sarcoidosis develop permanent organ damage, most often in the lungs. Long-term complications can develop in several part of the body: Lungs: If you have permanent scarring in your lungs, it can get harder to breathe. You might develop a condition called pulmonary hypertension, a type of high blood pressure affecting the blood vessels in your lungs. It can make your heart work harder than normal to get blood into your lungs. Eyes: Inflammation may damage your retinas, which might eventually lead to blindness. In rare cases, sarcoidosis leads to glaucoma or cataracts. Kidneys : Sarcoidosis can change the way your body handles calcium, potentially leading to kidney stones and poor kidney function. Heart: If you have granulomas in your heart, you can have problems with heart rhythm, blood flow, and normal heart functioning. Nervous system: When sarcoidosis affects the brain and nerves, it can lead to symptoms that mimic multiple sclerosis, such as weakness and numbness. It can also cause drooping facial muscles and symptoms ranging from seizures to hearing problems. Can sarcoidosis be fatal? Most people with sarcoidosis will live as long as people without the condition. Death, from heart, lung, or other problems, happens in 1% to 5% of cases. Living With Sarcoidosis When you have sarcoidosis, it's important to follow recommendations from your doctor and to let the doctor know if you have any new or changing symptoms. Even if you're not having bothersome or new symptoms, keep follow-up appointments so your doctor can monitor your health, see if medications are working, and spot any complications. You also can feel better and limit complications and treatment side effects by making some lifestyle changes in these areas: Healthy eating. Aim for a nutritious diet, with lean meats and other proteins, fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and not too much sugar. Try to maintain a healthy weight. Avoiding alcohol. Some medications used for sarcoidosis can be hard on your liver. Alcohol can increase the risk of liver damage. Not smoking. Smoking can make your lung symptoms worse. Reach out to a smoking cessation program if you want to quit and need help. Being physically active. Staying active can improve your mood, strengthen your muscles, and reduce fatigue. Managing stress . Stress-reduction techniques like meditation can help some people with chronic illness. Getting enough sleep. Improving your sleep can lower inflammation and improve well-being. If you are struggling to sleep, talk to your doctor. Seeking support. If you're struggling to cope, consider meeting with a counselor or joining a support group."
12,What Is SARS?,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome , or SARS, is a potentially deadly illness that started in China and quickly spread around the world in 2003. It's caused by a virus called SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) which gives you flu-like symptoms. SARS was the first serious and easily transmitted new disease of the 21st century, but not the last. More than 10% of people with SARS needed a machine to help them breathe. (Photo Credit: E+/Getty Images) SARS Outbreak SARS first sprang to the world’s attention in early 2003, though the first cases were reported in China in late 2002. Its origins were linked to horseshoe bats living in caves in mainland China. These bats harbor a coronavirus similar to that of SARS. The theory is that the bats infected civet cats, which were sold for food at live animal markets in the country. People were infected not from eating the civets but from touching the animals as they raised or killed them. Over the first half of 2003, more than 8,000 people got sick in an outbreak that spread to 26 countries. Nearly 800 people died. Doctors and scientists tracked the disease to southeastern China, near Hong Kong. From there, travelers carried SARS to other countries in Asia, such as Vietnam and Singapore, as well as to Europe and Canada. Public health officials around the world scrambled to contain the outbreak, and there've been no reported cases since 2004. SARS Causes SARS is caused by a virus that takes over your body’s cells and uses them to make copies of itself. The SARS virus is from a group of viruses known as coronaviruses, which also cause the common cold . SARS spreads when people who have it cough or sneeze , spraying tiny droplets of liquid containing the virus to other people within 2-3 feet. Some may get the virus by touching something those droplets hit, then touching their nose, eyes , or mouth . Someone with SARS isn't contagious before symptoms appear. If you live with or are in close contact with someone who has SARS, you're more likely to get it than if you're just passing by or sitting in a waiting room across from them. ""Close contact"" means hugging or kissing someone, talking with them less than 3 feet away, or sharing a knife, fork, or spoon with them. SARS Symptoms The symptoms of SARS start off similar to those of the flu . They may include: A fever over 100.4 F (38 C) Chills Muscle aches Shortness of breath About 1 in 5 people with SARS may also get diarrhea . But the symptoms can get worse fast. SARS causes a dry cough that shows up anywhere from 2 to 7 days into the illness. This cough can keep your body from getting enough oxygen, and more than 1 in 10 people with SARS need a machine to help them breathe. SARS can lead to other health problems, including pneumonia , heart failure , and liver failure . People who are over 60 and have ongoing illnesses like diabetes or hepatitis are most likely to have these problems. SARS Test At the time of the SARS outbreak, there weren't any ways to test for it. Usually, a diagnosis was made from looking at your symptoms and asking whether you'd traveled to certain parts of Asia or been in close contact with someone suspected of having SARS. Now we can check for SARS with: Blood tests Stool tests Nasal swab tests SARS-related pneumonia can be diagnosed with CT scans or X-rays of the chest. SARS Treatment At the time of the original outbreak, there were no targeted treatments available for SARS. Antiviral drugs like ribavirin and l opinavir/ritonavir were used. So were corticosteroids (commonly known as steroids). The best treatment strategy for SARS remains unknown. People with SARS were mostly given supportive care, such as antibiotics to fight off other infections while they recovered, or steroids to reduce swelling in the lungs. In serious cases, they could be given blood plasma from someone who already recovered from SARS and whose plasma would have antibodies. If their symptoms were mild, they recovered at home, taking over-the-counter medications for a fever or muscle aches. But if the symptoms got worse, they may have gone to a hospital for more treatment, like getting fluids or oxygen. SARS Prevention There’s no cure for SARS. You can lower your chances of getting it with some simple steps: Wash your hands often with soap and water, or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Don’t touch your eyes , nose, or mouth with dirty hands. Wear disposable gloves if you have contact with someone’s pee, poop , saliva , or other body fluids. Wipe surfaces like countertops with disinfectants, and wash personal items with soap and hot water . If you’re around someone with SARS, wear a surgical mask to cover your nose and mouth . Don't share eating and drinking utensils, towels, or bedding with someone who has SARS, unless you've washed the items first with soap and hot water. If you're talking to someone with SARS, stay at least 3 feet away. Keep children home from school if they get a fever or breathing problems. Take all these precautions for 10 days after the SARS patient's symptoms have disappeared. Takeaways The SARS virus is spread by people who have SARS coughing and sneezing on you. The best way to prevent it is to practice good hygiene and wear a mask when you're around someone who has it. There's no known cure for it. SARS FAQs Are COVID and SARS related? Yes. Both originated in China, are believed to have come from bats, and are caused by coronaviruses. The SARS virus is called SARS-CoV-1 or SARS-CoV, and the COVID-19 virus is called SARS-CoV-2. Both infections are spread the same way (via droplets from coughing or sneezing). One big difference is that SARS infected fewer people (8,096 cases, mostly in Asia) but was more severe, while COVID infected far more people (119,512,530 worldwide), but most of the cases had mild to moderate symptoms."
13,What You Should Know About Saw Palmetto for BPH,"Saw palmetto is commonly used in Europe and the United States as a treatment for enlarged prostate. Some small studies have shown benefits. However, several large studies do not show that saw palmetto reduces the size of the prostate or eases the urinary symptoms that come with an enlarged prostate. You might hear a doctor or nurse call that condition “benign prostate hyperplasia,” or BPH. Before you take saw palmetto, or any supplement for that matter, talk with your doctor first. They may interfere with prescription medicines, other treatments, or tests you might need. What Is Saw Palmetto? Saw palmetto ( Serenoa repens ) is a palm that grows in the Southern coastal regions of the United States. It is about 2 to 4 feet high. Its leaves are fan-shaped and sharp, and it makes a lot of berries. These fruits have a long history of use as medicine. Some Native Americans used them to help with urinary problems in men. Why Do People Take It? Some small studies have shown saw palmetto might help you with BPH symptoms in several ways. Among them: You may need to get up less often at night to pee. It can improve your flow when you go. It can ease painful urination . Can You Take It for Other Problems? You may have heard about people taking saw palmetto for other reasons than BPH. Some of them include: Low sex drive Hair loss Low sperm count Migraines Ongoing pelvic pain So far, studies have shown limited results for saw palmetto helping with these other types of problems. How Much Should You Take? For BPH, studies have used a daily intake of 320 milligrams of saw palmetto split into two doses. The doses will be different in other forms, such as tinctures (a liquid preparation). Get advice from your doctor. It may take 4 to 6 weeks for saw palmetto to have an effect. There are no food sources of saw palmetto . Are There Any Complications? Side effects are uncommon and typically mild. The most common are: Nausea Stomach pain Bad breath Constipation Diarrhea Vomiting Men taking saw palmetto have also reported erection problems, testicular pain, and tenderness in the breasts. You may also want to talk your doctor or pharmacist about the following: Interactions: If you take any medicines regularly, talk to your doctor before you start using saw palmetto supplements. They could mix poorly with medicines such as aspirin, NSAID painkillers such as ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil) and naproxen (Aleve), blood thinners , and hormone treatments. In combination with ginkgo biloba or garlic, saw palmetto might seriously increase the risk of bleeding. Other health conditions: People who have diseases or health conditions should not use saw palmetto without talking to a doctor first. Saw palmetto is not recommended for children or for women who are pregnant or breastfeeding."
14,What Are Scabies? How Do You Know If You Have Them?,"Scabies -- or human itch mites -- are eight-legged critters that burrow into the upper layer of your skin . There, they lay eggs. Once the eggs hatch, the mites climb to the surface of your skin, where they spread to other parts of your body. They can also spread to other people. Scabies. Scabies is caused by an infestation of tiny mites which burrow into your skin. Their presence usually appears as an itchy, pimple-like linear rash. The mites lay eggs which then hatch and spread to other areas of your body, as well as to other people. A severe form of scabies called “crusted scabies” (or Norwegian crusted scabies) sometimes happens in people who have weakened immune systems. It gets its name from the thick crusts of skin that form from large numbers of scabies mites and eggs. Scabies can live on the human body for 1 to 2 months. They can live in bedding or furniture for 2-3 days. How Do You Get Them? Scabies is very contagious. It is spread from one infected person to another through direct, prolonged, close physical contact. Nursing homes, extended care facilities, prisons, and childcare centers are frequent sites for scabies outbreaks. Healthy adults most often get these mites through sexual contact with an infected person. You can’t get scabies from pets. What Are the Symptoms? Your first signs that something is wrong will be intense itching (especially at night), and a pimple -like rash . You might notice these symptoms all over your body. Or they may be limited to certain areas, like your wrist, elbows, genitals, butt, or the webbing between your fingers. Children might experience itching or rash on their head, face, neck, palms, and on the soles of their feet . You might also notice burrows on your skin. These are tiny, raised, grayish-white or flesh-colored lines on your body. They’re caused by the mites digging their way into your skin. If you have crusted scabies, you might not have the itching or rash that scabies is known for. If you’ve had scabies before, you might develop symptoms after just a few days of being exposed to the mites. But if you’ve never had it, you may not have any symptoms for up to 6 weeks. Still, you can spread the mites to others -- even if you don’t show signs of infection yourself. How Is Scabies Diagnosed? Your doctor may be able to tell you have the mites by checking the rash or burrows on your body. They might also try to remove one of the mites from its burrow. They’ll do this either by scraping your skin or pulling the parasite from its burrow with a thin needle."
15,Life-Threatening Skin Rashes,"Rashes are common conditions with a variety of causes. Most rashes are not dangerous, but are rather a mere nuisance. Life-threatening skin rashes are rare, but when they do occur, you must seek immediate medical help. Five potentially life-threatening disorders that have skin rash as the primary symptom are: Pemphigus vulgaris (PV) Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSS) All of these diseases have one or more of the following features: The rash affects the entire body, or most of it. The rash affects both the skin and the mucous membranes. Mucous membranes are the moist linings of the following: Mouth and nose Eyes Anus/rectum Vagina or urethra, the opening for urine, in women and those assigned female at birth (AFAB) Urethra, opening at the tip of the penis, in men and those assigned male at birth (AMAB) Rashes have blisters on top of them. Blisters that accompany a serious rash usually have the following features: Blisters involve the thin outer layer of the skin that covers large parts of the body. This may mean several small blisters about 1 cm across or a few very large blisters several centimeters wide. Blisters are tense (full of fluid) at first, and then may become loose before breaking open. When they do rupture, the skin underneath is moist and usually painful. The underlying skin surface then dries up and crusts over. Pressing on a tense blister or scratching the skin next to a blister will extend the blister and make it larger. This is a common feature of these skin disorders. Blisters can involve any or all of the mucous membranes just listed. Blisters in these areas may not be noticeable because they rupture easily, especially in the mouth. Blisters on the mucous membranes that rupture may be very painful. When they occur in the mouth, pain makes it hard to eat or even drink."
16,Scarlet Fever,"What Is Scarlet Fever? Scarlet fever is a bacterial infection that causes a bright red rash. It looks and feels like sandpaper. Also called scarlatina, the infection is easily spread from person to person. It gets its name from the red, bumpy rash that typically covers the body. What Are the Symptoms of Scarlet Fever? Scarlet fever starts out looking like a sunburn . Most often, the rash begins on the face and neck and spreads to the rest of the body. It may itch. Other signs you or your child may have scarlet fever include: Fever, with or without chills Sore, red throat that may have white blotches Swollen glands in the neck Headache or body aches Nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain Red, swollen tongue that may be bumpy or have a whitish coating Flushed face with pale ring around the mouth Deep red coloring in the creases of the arms, legs, neck and groin After the rash goes away, your skin may peel for several weeks. What Causes Scarlet Fever? If your child has strep throat , there's a chance they will also develop scarlet fever. The same bacteria that causes scarlet fever causes strep throat. It's called ""group A strep."" Scarlet fever can also be linked to burns or wounds that become infected -- your own or the infected wounds of another person. Anyone can get scarlet fever, but it's most common in kids from 5 to 15 years old. The infection is often passed between classmates at school or family members who are in close contact with each other. It's most often spread by contact with the droplets emitted when an infected person coughs or sneezes. It can even be spread if you touch something -- like a plate or glass – on which these droplets have landed. How Is Scarlet Fever Diagnosed? Call your doctor if your child has a sore throat , especially if they also have a rash or a fever . Your doctor will run the following tests to check for scarlet fever: Physical exam . A doctor will take a look at the rash and throat, and see if the lymph nodes are swollen. They'll also look for other symptoms like chills, fever, and body ache. They’ll ask whether your child has nausea , vomiting , or no appetite. Throat swab. To confirm whether scarlet fever or strep throat is causing the symptoms, they’ll swab the throat and tonsils to test for the group A strep bacteria. Rapid strep test. A rapid test will give results before you leave the office. If that’s negative, the doctor may order a culture, a more in-depth test to see if the bacteria is actually present. It's important to test for strep because other illnesses can cause the same symptoms. They may have different treatments. How Is Scarlet Fever Treated? Typically, the treatment for scarlet fever is the same as for strep throat. Antibiotics will clear up scarlet fever by killing the strep bacteria that cause it. It may take a couple of weeks to get back to normal. Be sure to let day care providers and classmates know that they may have been exposed. In the meantime, these are some things you can do to make yourself or your child more comfortable: Over-the-counter medicines like acetaminophen and ibuprofen can help with pain and fever. But never give aspirin to children or teens . If your child is 4 or older, soothing drops can help with throat pain. Have soft foods, cold drinks, or ice pops while your throat is sore. Drink plenty of liquids. They’ll help keep your throat or your child's throat moist and stop dehydration . Gargle with salt water to help with mouth and throat pain . Add moisture to the air in your home. Use a cool mist humidifier. If the rash itches, try an over-the-counter anti-itch cream, and keep your child’s nails trimmed so they don’t hurt themselves scratching. It’s important to get treatment to prevent possible complications. The bacteria can spread throughout the body and cause other infections, including pneumonia. In rare cases, it can lead to rheumatic fever, a serious disease affecting the heart, joints and nervous system."
17,What Is Epidermolysis Bullosa?,"Epidermolysis bullosa is a rare genetic condition that makes skin so fragile that it can tear or blister at the slightest touch. Children born with it are often called “Butterfly Children” because their skin seems as fragile as a butterfly wing. Mild forms may get better with time. But severe cases can be painful, trigger other serious health issues, and can be life-threatening. If you have this condition, you need special treatment to keep your delicate skin as healthy as possible. Types There are five major types of epidermolysis bullosa. The kind you have depends on where your blisters tend to form. Epidermolysis Bullosa Simplex: The most common type, it first shows up in newborns. It mainly affects the palms of the hands and soles of the feet . Junctional epidermolysis bullosa : While it also first appears in babies, this is a more severe form that causes blistering in deep layers of the skin. Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa: If you have this type, your skin doesn’t have collagen to hold it together, or the collagen you do have doesn’t work well. This means the layers of your skin don’t seal together like they should. Sometimes this type doesn’t show up until early childhood. Kindler syndrome: This is a mixed condition since blisters appear across different skin layers. It can also cause patchy changes in your skin coloring when it’s exposed to the sun. Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita: This form causes blisters on your hands and feet as well as in mucous membranes like the mouth . Causes Almost all types of epidermolysis bullosa run in families. If you inherited certain gene glitches from your parents, you will have it. There’s one exception. Epidermolysis bullosa aquisita is the only type that’s not inherited. It happens because of a problem in your immune system . Symptoms Usually, signs of epidermolysis bullosa first appear in babies or toddlers . Painful skin blisters are the main symptom. They can form anywhere on the skin. Sometimes they also form on the eyes , or in parts of the throat, stomach , or bladder . If these blisters become infected or scar the skin, they cause more problems. Diagnosis To confirm the condition, your doctor may take a small sample of skin and send it to a lab where experts will use a microscope to look at it. Treatment There’s no cure for epidermolysis bullosa. But there are treatments for it. If you have a severe case, you’ll care for your skin much like someone who has a burn does. You’ll need to learn how to perform daily wound treatment and how to bandage and protect affected areas. Your doctor can also prescribe a medicine to help with pain relief. In some cases, you might need surgery. If you have blisters that have fused your fingers and toes together, your doctor can separate them. Or if your esophagus , the tube connecting your mouth to your stomach , becomes too scarred, you can get surgery to widen it to help you eat. Some people with epidermolysis bullosa still find eating too painful. In that case, your doctor may suggest a feeding tube so food goes right into your stomach. Tips for At-Home Care To help prevent blisters, you have to take special care of your skin. Reduce friction. Use lotion to keep your skin moist and reduce friction. If you cover wounds, use only dressings that aren’t sticky, then loosely wrap again with rolled gauze. Wear loose-fitting clothes without tags, tight sleeves, or seams. Drain blisters. If left untreated, these can fill with fluid and become infected. Your doctor can show you the best way to drain them. Keep cool. Keep your bath water no warmer than room temperature. Stay in air conditioning as much as you can and avoid heat and humidity. Know the signs of infection. Your skin may get red or feel hot to the touch if it is becoming infected. You could also notice pus or a yellow discharge crusting at the site, a red streak under the skin, or have fever or chills. If you see any of these signs, call your doctor right away. You may need antibiotics . Check your diet . Many people with epidermolysis bullosa have low levels of iron, selenium , or vitamin D . Your doctor may suggest that you see a nutritionist about eating more foods that are rich in these vitamins and minerals. Get support. Talk to your doctor or someone you trust. You might also find it helpful to talk about your feelings to a therapist or at a support group in your area."
18,Scars and Your Skin,"Scars are a natural part of the body's healing process. A scar results from the biologic process of wound repair in the skin and other tissues. Most wounds, except for very minor ones, result in some degree of scarring. Scars can result from accidents, diseases, skin conditions such as acne, or surgeries. How Do Scars Form? Scars form when the dermis (deep, thick layer of skin) is damaged. The body forms new collagen fibers (a naturally occurring protein in the body) to mend the damage, resulting in a scar. The new scar tissue will have a different texture and quality than the surrounding tissue. Scars form after a wound is completely healed. There are different kinds of scars. Most scars are flat and pale. However, in cases when the body produces too much collagen, scars can be raised. Raised scars are called hypertrophic scars or keloid scars. Both of these kinds of scars are more common in younger and dark-skinned people. Some scars can have a sunken or pitted appearance. This kind of scarring occurs when underlying structures supporting the skin (for example, fat or muscle) are lost. Some surgical scars have this appearance, as do some scars from acne. Scars also can appear as stretched skin. Such scars result when the skin stretches rapidly (for example, as in growth spurts or during pregnancy). In addition, this type of scar can occur when the skin is under tension (near a joint, for example) during the healing process. How Can Scars Be Treated? Although scars cannot be completely removed, their appearance can be improved to some extent. Methods for improving the appearance of scars include: Topical treatments, such as vitamin E, cocoa butter cream, silicone gel,onion extract products, and several commercial skin care products like Vaseline and Aquaphor that are sold over the counter may be somewhat effective in helping to heal scars. Surgery. Although it will not remove a scar, surgery can be used to alter a scar's shape or make it less noticeable. Surgery is not recommended in cases of hypertrophic or keloid scarring (raised scars) because there is a risk of recurring scars as well as more severe scarring that results from the treatment. Steroid injections. A course of steroid injections into a scar may help flatten it. Injections may help to soften the appearance of keloid or hypertrophic scars. 5-fluorouracil  (5-FU) or bleomycin can be injected into scars to reduce the size of the scar and ease itchiness and pain. Radiotherapy. Low-dose, superficial radiotherapy is used to prevent recurrence of severe keloid and hypertrophic scarring. This treatment is used only in extreme cases because of potential long-term side effects. Dermabrasion. This treatment involves the removal of the surface of the skin with special equipment. Dermabrasion is useful to blend in the irregularities of a scar whether it is raised or depressed. Microdermabrasion is a much less invasive form of dermabrasion but is minimally useful for very superficial scars. Laser resurfacing . This procedure, similar to dermabrasion, removes the surface layers of the skin using different types of lasers. Newer types of lasers may achieve more subtle results by working on the collagen in the dermis without removing the upper layers of skin. This advancement results in little down time as opposed to traditional laser resurfacing and dermabrasion, which requires a longer recovery. Filler injections. These treatments can be used to raise sunken scars to the level of surrounding skin. The effects of these injections are only temporary, however, and the procedures may need to be regularly repeated. Newer forms of injectable fillers are now on the market and may be an option for some people. Microneedling. Many small puncture holes are made into the superficial skin to stimulate collagen production and even introduce collagen stimulators or other products to try to reduce the appearance of scars. Cryosurgery freezes the scar to reduce the size of the scar, and reduce pain, itchiness, hardness and discoloration. This may be combined with steroid or 5-FU injections."
19,Turner Syndrome,"What Is Turner Syndrome? Turner syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that’s found only in girls. It can cause problems ranging from short height to heart defects. Sometimes, the symptoms are so mild that it doesn’t get diagnosed until a female is a teen or young adult. The condition can cause symptoms throughout your life, but treatments and continued research help people manage their condition. Turner Syndrome Causes Turner syndrome happens when a female is missing certain genes that are normally on the X chromosome. (Females have two X chromosomes. Males have an X and a Y). Some girls with Turner are actually missing a whole copy of the X chromosome. For others, just part of one containing the particular set of genes is missing. The different ways genes can be affected include: Monosomy . A problem with the mom’s egg or dad’s sperm causes an absence of the X chromosome in every cell of the body. Mosaicism . When cell division during early stages of fetal development doesn’t happen correctly, some cells in the body get two complete copies of the X chromosome. Other cells have only one copy. X chromosome abnormalities . Cells have one complete copy and one abnormal or missing copy of the X chromosome. Y chromosome material . In a few cases, some cells get one copy of the X chromosome and other cells get one copy of the X chromosome and some Y chromosome material. Biologically, you develop as a female. The Y chromosome material increases your risk of a type of cancer called gonadoblastoma. About 70,000 U.S. women and girls live with it. Research has found that almost 99% of babies missing the chromosome are miscarried. But about 1% of the time, these babies are born, and they have the syndrome. Symptoms of Turner Syndrome Signs of Turner syndrome can start even before birth, and they give parents some idea that their baby might be born with the condition. An ultrasound of a baby with it may show heart and kidney problems or a buildup of fluid. A DNA test using a blood sample from the mother can also screen for Turner syndrome before birth. At birth or during infancy, girls might have a number of physical features that point to the condition. Swollen hands and feet or smaller than average height at birth are among them. Others include: A wide or weblike neck with extra folds of skin Receding or small lower jaw and a high, narrow roof of the mouth (palate) Low-set ears and a low hairline Broad chest with widely spaced nipples Arms that turn outward at the elbows Short fingers and toes and narrow fingernails and toenails Delayed growth Heart defects Down-turning eyelids Short roots of teeth Kidney abnormalities Greater than usual number of moles on the skin In older females, throughout the lifespan, symptoms can continue. They can include: No growth spurts at expected times in childhood A shorter height than might be expected based on parents’ height Learning disabilities Inability to go through puberty normally (because of ovarian failure) Loss of menstrual cycles Infertility Turner Syndrome Complications Beginning at birth and continuing throughout a person’s life, Turner syndrome can be linked with other health conditions. They might include: Heart problems because of its physical structure Increased chance of diabetes and high blood pressure Hearing loss Kidney problems that can raise the chance of high blood pressure and urinary tract infections Immune disorders such as diabetes , inflammatory bowel disease , and hypothyroidism (when your thyroid gland can’t make enough hormone to keep your body running as it should) Bleeding in the digestive tract Dental and vision problems Scoliosis , which is a curving of the spine , and osteoporosis , which causes brittle bones Learning disabilities High blood pressure Mental health issues Obesity Women with Turner have trouble conceiving. If you’re able to become pregnant , high blood pressure and gestational diabetes might be issues. Turner Syndrome Diagnosis If an ultrasound shows something abnormal while you’re pregnant, your doctor may want to examine your baby’s chromosomes with a karyotype. This test compares chromosomes by lining them up. To get samples from you, your doctor may recommend: Amniocentesis. This is when protective fluid that surrounds a baby is taken from your uterus. Blood sample. This can help find out whether the baby is missing all or part of an X chromosome. Chorionic villus sampling (CVS). Your doctor removes tissue samples from a portion of the placenta for testing. This test is typically done around 10-12 weeks of pregnancy. Cheek scraping or skin sample. Your doctor may be able to test you using cells scraped from the inside of your cheek (buccal smear), or a sample of skin cells. If a diagnosis isn’t made before or at birth, other lab tests that check hormones, thyroid function and blood sugar can help diagnose it. Because of the problems linked to Turner syndrome, doctors will also often suggest tests for the kidneys, heart, and hearing. Turner Syndrome Treatments Medical care often calls for a team of specialists that’s built around the specific needs of each person, because the cases vary so widely. There’s no cure, but most girls will take the same main therapies during childhood and the teen years. These are: Growth hormone , given as an injection a few times a week, to increase height as much as possible. Estrogen therapy, beginning around the time of puberty until a woman reaches the average age of menopause . This hormone treatment can help a woman grow and reach adult sexual development. Almost all women with the condition need fertility treatments to become pregnant. And carrying a child can come with health risks. If you have Turner syndrome, you should discuss those issues with your doctor."
20,"Psychosis: Causes, Symptoms, and Treatment","What Is Psychosis? Psychosis affects the way your brain processes information. It causes you to lose touch with reality. You might see, hear, or believe things that aren’t real. Psychosis is a symptom, not an illness. It can be triggered by a mental illness, a physical injury or illness, substance abuse, or extreme stress or trauma. Psychotic disorders, like schizophrenia, involve psychosis that usually affects you for the first time in the late teen years or early adulthood. Even before what doctors call the first episode of psychosis (FEP), you may show slight changes in the way you act or think. This is called the prodromal period and could last days, weeks, months, or even years. Sometimes you can lose touch with reality even when you don’t have a primary psychotic illness such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. When this happens, it's called secondary psychosis. These episodes stem from something else, like drug use or a medical condition. Whatever the reason, they tend to disappear in a short time, and they often stay away if you treat the condition that caused them. Who gets psychosis? Young people are especially likely to get it, but doctors don’t know why. It most often starts when you're in your teens to late 20s. But it can also affect older people and, rarely, children. How common is psychosis? It's hard to know exactly how common psychosis is. Studies have shown that it affects from 15 to 100 out of every 100,000 people each year. Psychosis vs. schizophrenia Psychosis is a symptom of schizophrenia, a complicated mental illness that also has other symptoms. Psychosis can also be a symptom of other conditions, such as serious depression. Psychosis vs. neurosis Doctors used to use the term ""neurosis"" to describe what they now call anxiety disorders. Symptoms of these disorders may include obsessive thoughts, irrational fears, or compulsive behaviors. But unlike psychosis, they don't involve losing touch with reality. Psychosis symptoms include delusions (false thoughts) and hallucinations (sensing things that aren't real).  Photo Credit: E+ / Getty Images Symptoms of Psychosis Psychosis doesn’t start suddenly. It usually follows a pattern. Warning signs before psychosis It starts with gradual changes in the way you think about and understand the world. You or your friends or family members may notice: A drop in grades or job performance Trouble thinking clearly or concentrating Suspiciousness or unease around others Lack of self-care or hygiene Spending more time alone than usual Stronger emotions than situations call for No emotions at all Signs of early psychosis You may: Hear, see, or taste things others don’t Hang on to unusual beliefs or thoughts, no matter what others say Pull away from family and friends Stop taking care of yourself Not be able to think clearly or pay attention What does a psychotic episode look like? Usually you’ll notice all of the above psychosis symptoms, including: Hallucinations . These could be: Auditory hallucinations: Hearing voices when no one is around Tactile hallucinations: Strange sensations or feelings you can’t explain Visual hallucinations: You see people or things that aren’t there, or you think the shape of things looks wrong. Olfactory hallucinations: You smell odors no one else can. Gustatory hallucinations: You taste things when there's nothing in your mouth. Delusions : Beliefs that aren’t in line with your culture and that don’t make sense to others, like: Outside forces are in control of your feelings and actions. Small events or comments have huge meaning. You have special powers, are on a special mission, or actually are a god. You might have persecutory delusions, in which you think a person or group of people wants to harm you. Or you could have grandiose delusions , in which you believe you are all-powerful or in a position of authority. Religious delusions, sometimes called spiritual psychosis , center on spiritual or religious themes. Unstable thought patterns could cause outward symptoms, like: Suddenly losing your train of thought, in conversation or while doing a task Speaking quickly Talking constantly Can you be aware of your own psychosis? Often, people with psychosis don't know it . Your hallucinations and delusions may seem very real to you. 3 Stages of Psychosis Experts say there are three stages of psychotic episodes. What each stage looks like and how long it lasts will vary from person to person. Prodrome In this stage, you have mild changes in your thoughts and moods that tend to come on gradually. They might include: Trouble sleeping Sadness Anxiety Loss of concentration and motivation Avoiding friends and family members Suspiciousness and strange beliefs Acute This is when you have typical symptoms of psychosis, like: Confusion Delusions Hallucinations Behavior and personality changes These changes may be apparent to others around you. Recovery While some of your symptoms may remain for a while, they eventually go away, allowing you to return your usual daily routines. Most people recover if they get the right treatment. You may never have another psychotic episode. Psychosis Types Along with secondary psychosis and psychosis due to a mental illness, you might hear about these types: Postpartum psychosis This is a rare but serious type of postpartum depression that can happen from a few days to a few weeks after you give birth. It's more likely to affect those who already have a condition like schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Doctors aren't sure what causes it, but they think sleep loss, hormone changes, and your genes could play a role. Along with hallucinations and delusions, you could have mood changes like sadness and/or joy. If you or someone you know has these symptoms, seek medical help right away. Bipolar psychosis About half of people with bipolar disorder sometimes have delusions and/or hallucinations, usually when they're in a state of mania (a period of high energy and mood). Treatments include antipsychotic drugs and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), which involves passing mild electric currents through the brain. Postictal psychosis (PIP) This happens in some people with epilepsy who've had a number of seizures in a row. It's more likely when you've had a seizure disorder for a long time or you've had mental illness in the past. Antipsychotic drugs like olanzapine and risperidone can stop symptoms and may help prevent future episodes. Myxedematous psychosis (also called myxedema psychosis) You can get this when your thyroid gland doesn't work well, a condition known as hypothyroidism. Because of the way thyroid hormone affects your brain, you may have hallucinations, delusions, and changes to your sense of taste or smell if there's not enough in your body. Your doctor can test your level of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) to confirm myxedema psychosis and rule out other conditions like schizophrenia. Taking thyroid hormone can help balance your gland's activity and end the psychosis. Korsakoff psychosis This is a complication of a condition called Wernicke encephalopathy, a brain disorder caused by a shortage of vitamin B1 that most often affects those who have alcohol use disorder. Along with serious memory problems, it can cause disorientation and emotional changes. You may tell false or confused stories when you can't remember what really happened. It's treated by restoring your levels of B1 along with good nutrition and hydration. Menstrual psychosis This extremely rare type of psychosis can appear at the beginning of your period, around ovulation, or during the few days before your period starts. It happens because out-of-balance hormones at different points in your cycle can affect thinking and moods. It may show up quickly and disappear just as fast. During the episodes, you may be confused about what's real, hallucinate, and believe things that aren't true. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and antipsychotic drugs can help ward off symptoms, even with hormone levels that are hard to predict. Causes of Psychosis Doctors don’t know exactly what causes psychosis. Genes are thought to play a role, but they don't in every case. What can trigger a psychotic episode? In general, you develop psychosis due to a mental or physical condition, alcohol or drug use, or a traumatic event. Psychological causes . Along with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, serious stress, anxiety, or depression can trigger a psychotic episode. Serious sleep loss could also be a cause. Trauma. The death of a loved one, a sexual assault, or war can lead to psychosis. The type of trauma and the age you were when it happened also play a role. Medical conditions. Besides epilepsy and thyroid problems, illnesses and injuries that can bring on psychosis include: Traumatic brain injuries Brain tumors Strokes Parkinson’s disease Alzheimer’s disease Dementia HIV and AIDS Lupus Multiple sclerosis Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) Syphilis Malaria Drug-induced psychosis. Both drugs that depress the nervous system, like cannabis (marijuana), and stimulant drugs, like cocaine and amphetamines, can affect your brain activity in dramatic ways, so that what seems real to you doesn't match with the world. Some prescription medications can also lead to psychosis. Most of the time, this goes away when you stop using the drug. But there’s a strong link between all these drugs and primary psychosis. More than 25% of those who are diagnosed with amphetamine-induced psychosis later have psychotic disorders . Cannabis is involved in roughly half of all cases. Studies suggest that these drugs may not so much cause psychosis as uncover the condition when it’s already present among people with psychiatric conditions, such as schizophrenic disorders or a family history of psychosis. If you've been using a drug for a while, you could also have psychotic symptoms when you suddenly stop taking it. Drugs used to treat mental illness can lead to problems as well. Although it’s rare, if you've been taking an antipsychotic (such as chlorpromazine, fluphenazine, haloperidol, perphenazine, and others) for many months or years, you could develop a movement disorder call tardive dyskinesia because of the long-term effects of the medication on your brain. And if you stop taking an antipsychotic medicine, you may get supersensitivity psychosis. Doctors think it happens because ongoing use of this type of drug changes how your brain responds to the chemical dopamine. The use of some antipsychotic medications, like aripiprazole (Abilify), carries a higher risk of psychosis. Most drug-triggered symptoms will clear up after the drug leaves your system. But psychosis from cocaine, PCP (phencyclidine, or ""angel dust""), and amphetamines could last for weeks. While you wait for the episode to pass, your doctor can ease the symptoms with an anti-anxiety drug such as lorazepam (Ativan) or maybe an antipsychotic. Alcohol-induced psychosis. You can get delusions or hallucinations when you're intoxicated on alcohol, suddenly stop using alcohol, or have long-term alcoholism . Your doctor can treat you with antipsychotics or other medications. If you're able to stop using alcohol, your psychosis symptoms probably won't come back. When to See a Doctor If you have any psychosis symptoms or notice psychotic behavior in someone around you, contact a doctor or mental health professional right away. The sooner you get treatment, the more effective it's likely to be. Keep in mind that those with psychosis often don't recognize that they're having symptoms. Psychosis Diagnosis You can see a psychologist , psychiatrist, or a social worker. They’ll find out what might have caused your symptoms and look for related conditions. They may do drug screening tests as well as blood tests to look for physical causes. Doctors diagnose mental illnesses after ruling out other things that could be causing psychotic symptoms. Psychosis tests There aren't any tests your doctor can use to diagnosis psychosis. Instead, they'll ask you several questions, such as: If any mental health conditions run in your family Whether you take any medications or use illegal drugs What kind of moods you've had lately How well you're able to do your usual activities If you've had hallucinations or delusions, what they were like Psychosis Complications When you have psychosis, you may not be able to care for yourself or do the things you normally do. Some people develop substance use disorders when they use drugs or alcohol to try to deal with their symptoms. People with psychosis have a higher risk of self-harm and suicide. If you're thinking of hurting yourself, or know someone who is, call or text 988 or chat 988lifeline.org . Psychosis Treatment It’s important to get treated early, after the first episode of psychosis. That will help keep the symptoms from affecting your relationships , job, or schoolwork. It may also help you avoid more problems down the road. Medical treatment Your doctor may recommend coordinated specialty care (CSC). This is a team approach to treating schizophrenia when the first symptoms appear. The family is involved as much as possible. The psychosis treatment your doctor recommends will depend on the cause of your psychosis. Your doctor will prescribe antipsychotic drugs – in pills, liquids, or shots – to ease your symptoms. They’ll also suggest you avoid using drugs and alcohol. Inpatient care You might need to get treated in a hospital if you’re at risk of harming yourself or others, or if you can't control your behavior or do your daily activities. The doctor will check your symptoms, look for causes, and suggest the best treatment for you. Some clinics and programs offer help just for young people. Therapy Counseling, along with medicines, can also help manage psychosis. Cognitive behavioral therapy(CBT) can help you recognize when you have psychotic episodes. It also helps you figure out whether what you see and hear is real or imagined. This kind of therapy also stresses the importance of antipsychotic medications and sticking with your treatment. Supportive psychotherapy helps you learn to live with and manage psychosis. It also teaches healthy ways of thinking. Cognitive enhancement therapy (CET) uses computer exercises and group work to help you think and understand better. Family psychoeducation and support involves your loved ones. It helps you bond and improves the way you solve problems together. Coordinated specialty care (CSC) creates a team approach in treating psychosis when it’s first diagnosed. CSC combines medication and psychotherapy with social services and work and education support. Takeaways When you have psychosis, you have a hard time understanding what's real and what's not. Many things can cause it, including physical and mental illnesses and substance abuse. Treatment, especially when you get it early in the process, can be very effective."
21,Severe Hearing Loss,"What Is Severe Hearing Loss? Severe hearing loss means you can hear some sounds, but very poorly. You may not be able to hear someone speaking, even if they are using a normal voice. You may be able to hear only very loud sounds. Hearing loss can happen in many different ways to people of all ages. It’s different for everyone. The key is to work with your health care team to find ways to help you make the most of the hearing you have. There are many treatments that can help you or your child enjoy life. Causes Babies can be born with severe hearing loss , and children and adults can get it at any point in their lives. It can happen suddenly or over many years, in one or both ears, and be brief or long-lasting. To understand how hearing loss happens, it helps to know how your ear works. Noise travels through the air as sound waves, which vibrate your eardrum and move three tiny bones inside your ear. That causes waves in the fluid that fills your inner ear. Those waves bend tiny hair cells, which are attached to nerves. They pass electrical signals to the main hearing nerve, called the auditory nerve, which leads to the brain . Your DNA has many genes that help build the structures involved in hearing. A problem with any of them can mean a baby is born without this sense. Over half of babies born with severe hearing loss, it’s because of a faulty gene. About 20% of babies born with it also have another genetic condition, like Down syndrome. Babies also can lose their hearing because of a problem in the womb. Pregnant women who take certain medicines, such as the cancer drug thalidomide or drugs for tuberculosis , may have a baby with severe hearing loss. It can also happen if a woman has certain infections, like cytomegalovirus. You also may lose your hearing as you get older. It can happen because of: Noise. A single very loud noise, like a gunshot or explosion, can damage hearing. So can being around loud noises for a long time, like living next to an airport runway. Diseases. Different conditions can put the ears or nerves involved in hearing at risk, including ear infections, brain tumors , rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases , or Meniere’s disease, a disorder of the inner ear. Clogs. Ear canals stopped up with earwax or an object stuck inside can keep you from hearing well. You can also damage your ear if you try to remove it the wrong way. Injury. Head trauma can damage the inside of the ears. So can some sports, like scuba diving or skydiving. Medications . Certain drugs, including some that treat cancer , heart disease, and serious infections, can damage your ear and cause hearing loss. Sometimes, it’s permanent, but in other cases, the problem goes away after you stop taking the medicines. Symptoms If your child has trouble hearing, you’ll probably notice it by the way they behave. Some signs include: A hard time learning to speak, or speaking later than other children their age Not paying attention to sounds or when people call them Poor school work If hearing loss is affecting you, you may notice that you have a hard time interacting with others because you can’t hear them. Signs include: Trouble hearing people speak in groups or in noisy places Can’t hear someone behind you speaking Think other people are mumbling when they are speaking Trouble hearing people on the phone Listen to the television or car radio at a very loud volume Don’t hear the alarm clock Getting a Diagnosis It’s important to diagnose severe hearing loss as early as possible, especially for children. In some states, laws require medical staff to screen newborns for hearing before they leave the hospital. If your baby doesn’t get a test, ask hospital staff where you can get one. There are two types of newborn hearing tests : Automated auditory brain response . Medical staff will put soft earphones on your baby’s ears and sensors on their head. A machine measures their hearing nerve’s response to soft clicks or tones. Otoacoustic emissions . A tiny probe inside your baby’s ear canal measures the echo from soft noises played into their ears. If your child shows any symptoms of severe hearing loss as they get older, talk to your pediatrician. If you have trouble hearing, you can talk to your doctor. Testing is usually about the same for children and adults. Your doctor may refer you to a hearing specialist called an otolaryngologist or otologist. They’ll ask about your medical history and do a physical exam of your ears. They may ask you: Do you often feel as if people are speaking too quietly or mumbling? How hard is it to hear someone speak in a loud or noisy place? How long have you noticed a problem? Do you have any other medical conditions? Have any members of your family had hearing loss? For a child with hearing problems, the doctor may ask you: How does your child respond when you call their name or make sounds at home? When did they start talking? Was there ever a time when they were around very loud noises? Have they ever had an accident that hurt their head? The doctor may tell you to see an audiologist, a professional trained in treating hearing problems. They can measure how much hearing you or your child has lost using different tests. Pure tone audiometry . You’ll sit in a soundproof booth and wear headphones and a special headband. The audiologist will play different pitches of sound and ask you what you can hear. Speech audiometry. Also in the booth with headphones, you’ll hear different words at different volumes and repeat them to the audiologist. The test measures how softly and how clearly you can understand speech. Tympanometry .This is a test that is included in all evaluations to measure the middle ear space and rule out congestion or ear drum abnormalities. A small probe in each ear measures how your eardrum responds to air pushed into the ears. For a child with hearing loss, the audiologist may want to see how well they respond to instructions. They may tell them how to play a game to see how they understand speech. They may ask them to look at the sources of sounds. Questions to Ask Your Doctor If you have severe hearing loss, you’ll want to ask your doctor questions about your condition, like: What caused my hearing loss? Will it go away? Do I need to see any other doctors? What kind of treatments are there? Will they cure my hearing loss? If your child has severe hearing loss, you’ll also want to ask: What will my child need at school to deal with hearing loss? What can we do for them at home? How can they learn to speak? Will my other children have hearing loss? Will the hearing loss continue to get worse? Treatment Treatment for severe hearing loss usually means using different technology to improve the hearing you have. There’s no single therapy that’s best for every person with the condition. Your doctor will recommend one based on how much hearing you’ve lost, how healthy you are, your lifestyle, and how your ears were damaged. Your treatment options include: Hearing aids . They make low sounds louder or easier to hear. Some may help cut background noise. Some hearing aids fit inside the ears. They can be so small that other people may not notice them. Others have clips that fit over the top of the ears to hold them steady. You can take them out when it’s time to sleep, swim, or shower. Extended-wear hearing aids are made of soft material. An audiologist will place them in your or your child’s ears, and they can stay there for months. People who are active may wear them while playing sports. Additional reading: Can a deaf person hear with a hearing aid ? Implants. Middle ear implants are devices that vibrate inside your ear. Your doctor will place them there for you. You can use them for long periods of time. Cochlear implants help people who have such severe hearing loss that hearing aids don’t help. They trigger the nerves inside the ears. They don’t cure hearing loss, but they can give children and adults the sensation of sound and improved word/speech recognition. In the hospital, a surgeon places the cochlear implant inside the cochlear that sends a signal to the cochlear nerve and is stimulated via a magnet under the skin. About 4 weeks later, you’ll see the audiologist again to get the outside parts of the implant, including a microphone, a transmitter, and a small computer called a speech processor. These parts send signals to the device in your ear to translate the sounds around you. You can wear them behind your ear like a hearing aid. It can take a long time after the surgery to get cochlear implants to work best for you or your child. You’ll need support from hearing specialists and language therapists to learn how to use the device and respond to the sounds you can hear. The process takes a lot of time and effort. Your doctor will help you decide if you or your child are a good fit for this therapy. Taking Care of Yourself or Your Child It can be hard to lose your hearing, whether suddenly or over many years. If your child has severe hearing loss, you may worry about the parts of life that they’ll miss. Remember that there are many things that can help people of all ages with the condition enjoy life. As you work with your doctor to pick a treatment plan, you can take steps to make life easier for you or your child. For your child: Therapy can help your child learn to use a hearing aid and find ways to communicate. A family or a speech therapist can teach them to say words clearly so others understand. They can also learn how to use other techniques, including sign language, natural gestures, and speech reading. A therapist can help you decide which approach is right for your child and how your family can help. Talk to your child’s school and see what they can do to help them in the classroom. They may be able to use HATS, or Hearing Assistive Technology Systems, small FM radio frequency devices that make sounds easier to hear. Teachers speak into a special microphone that sends sounds to a small receiver that your child uses to hear the lessons. For yourself: Work with an audiologist to learn ways to deal with noisy places or group conversations. Use HATS that make your alarms, phone, or television easier to hear. Some devices can let you know when someone is ringing the doorbell. Style your home to make sounds easier to hear. Place carpet or rugs on floors to cut down on noise. Arrange chairs so you can sit across from your friends during visits. It may help to talk to a therapist or counselor to deal with any worry or sadness you or your child may feel. Also, support groups of other families dealing with severe hearing loss are great places to get advice and understanding. What to Expect Severe hearing loss is different for everyone. It may affect you or your child for many years. But it doesn’t have to keep you from enjoying life. You should be able to live independently, go to school or college, and have a career with severe hearing loss. Work with your health care team to find treatments and strategies that work for you. It’s important to diagnose and treat severe hearing loss as soon as possible. The sooner you or your child can begin therapy, the better you’ll be able to adapt. Getting Support Connect with others who are living with severe hearing loss or get helpful information from patient groups like the Hearing Loss Association of America ."
22,Shaken Baby Syndrome,"What Is Shaken Baby Syndrome? Shaken baby syndrome is a serious brain injury that happens to a baby or young child when it’s shaken with force. The impact kills the baby’s brain cells and keeps oxygen from getting to the brain. Shaken baby syndrome is a form of child abuse . When a baby is shaken hard by the shoulders, arms, or legs, it can cause learning disabilities , behavior disorders, vision problems or blindness, hearing and speech issues, seizures , cerebral palsy , serious brain injury, and permanent disability. In some cases, it can be fatal. Shaken baby syndrome is a type of abusive head trauma (AHT). AHT is the No. 1 cause of child abuse deaths in kids under the age of 5 in the U.S., and it causes about one-third of child abuse deaths. Children under the age of 1 are at highest risk. Other forms of abusive head trauma include: Forcefully throwing or dropping a child on purpose Hitting the child's head or neck against something, like the floor or a piece of furniture Hitting the child's head or neck with an object Shaken baby syndrome is different from gently tossing a baby playfully into the air, bouncing a baby on your knee , or bicycling or jogging with your baby. Though their brains and necks are fragile, babies are also unlikely to get shaken injuries by falling off furniture or making sudden stops in a car. The injuries caused by shaken baby syndrome are also very unlikely to happen if your baby accidentally falls from your arms. Signs of Shaken Baby Syndrome Being shaken affects babies in many ways. Symptoms include: Vomiting Bluish skin Tremors or shakes Breathing issues Drowsiness Less interest in eating Trouble sucking No more smiling or talking Low energy or decreased muscle tone Extreme crankiness Rigidity Seizures Not being able to lift their head You may notice bruises on the arms or chest in the places the baby has been grabbed. Other physical signs include: A larger than usual head or forehead Different-sized pupils Not being able to focus Favoring one arm or leg over another A soft spot on the head that appears to be bulging Babies with shaken baby syndrome may also have symptoms you can't see, such as: Broken ribs or other bones Spinal cord or neck injury Bleeding in the brain In mild cases, behavior, health, or learning issues show up later on. Shaken baby syndrome eyes Shaking a baby can cause bleeding inside the eye, called retinal hemorrhages. The retina might also detach. The jelly-like filling inside the eye, called the vitreous, might also fill with blood. Shaken Baby Syndrome Long-Term Effects Shaken baby syndrome leads to long-term disabilities in about 80% of cases. It causes a traumatic brain injury, specifically what's called a closed-brain injury. Although symptoms of mild injury might go away with time and medical care, others can be long-lasting and can affect your life in different ways. Thinking problems can include: Confusion Short attention span Memory problems Trouble with judgment Not being able to understand abstract concepts Not being able to follow directions beyond one or two steps Movement problems can include: Paralysis Weakness Tightening and stiffening of muscles (spasticity) Poor balance and coordination Tremors Swallowing problems Problems with the senses can include: Trouble speaking, finding the right words, or understanding speech (aphasia) Trouble reading and writing Slow speech Problems identifying objects and what they do Problems with daily life can include: Trouble dressing, eating, or bathing Trouble paying bills or handling other tasks Not being able to drive Social problems can include: Trouble making friends Not understanding social cues Physical problems can include: Fatigue Dizziness Headache Lack of bowel or bladder control Personality issues can include: Moodiness Short temper Lack of motivation Anxiety and depression Inappropriate sexual behavior Traumatic brain injuries can sometimes lead to epilepsy, which might show up years later. Causes of Shaken Baby Syndrome It takes infants awhile to be able to hold their heads up. That’s because their neck muscles start out weak and get stronger as they grow. The same goes for their brains, which need time to develop. When a baby is shaken, its brain can bounce between the front and back of its skull. This causes it to bleed, bruise , and swell. It only takes a few seconds of aggressive shaking for this to happen. Risk factors that lead to shaken baby syndrome Babies bring a lot of joy, but there can also be moments of frustration if you feel like you can’t console their crying. Most caregivers handle those times just fine. But if those feelings boil over, it can cross a line. Certain things can increase your risk of crossing that line, including: Alcohol or substance abuse Unstable family situations Depression Shaken Baby Syndrome Diagnosis Because shaken baby syndrome can affect so many parts of a child's health, there may be more than one doctor or specialist involved in the diagnosis. Depending on the child's level of injury, the tests may be done in doctor's offices or a pediatric intensive care unit. To check the brain , doctors may use a CT scan to look for injuries that need attention right away. MRI scans also show doctors detailed areas of the brain . X-rays of other body parts, like the arms, legs, spine , and skull, show fractures and whether they were created by force or accident. Doctors might also use a full body scan in babies known as a ""skeletal survey."" To check for eye injuries and bleeding, an eye specialist may do an eye exam . Some disorders can mimic the symptoms of shaken baby syndrome. To rule those out, doctors may order blood tests. Shaken Baby Syndrome Treatment and Prevention Treatment for shaken baby syndrome depends on the injury. Surgery may be needed in an emergency. Some children will need care for the rest of their lives. Shaken baby syndrome is 100% preventable. It starts with making sure all the baby's caregivers – parents, grandparents, babysitters , nannies, etc. – understand two things: The dangers of shaking a baby, even for a few seconds That babies cry a lot at first. The National Center for shaken baby syndrome calls it PURPLE crying: P eak pattern: At 2-3 months old, babies cry the most. U npredictable: Crying starts and stops without reason. R esistant to soothing: Nothing stops the crying. P ain-like look on face: When babies cry, they look like they're in pain , even if they're not. L ong bouts of crying: Babies can cry for hours at a time. E vening crying: Some babies cry more in the afternoon and evening. Sometimes you can stop the crying by rubbing the baby's back, singing, using “white noise” from an app or the sound of running water, taking a walk, or using a pacifier . Sometimes nothing seems to work. That’s when you especially need to manage your feelings. Have a plan in place. If you feel pushed beyond your limit, put the baby on their back in a safe place – or inside your home in a car seat with the baby strapped in on the floor (never leave your child alone in the car) – and step away for a moment. Call someone you trust who'll listen to your frustrations. As you talk, check on the baby every 5 or 10 minutes. You could also ask someone to watch your baby for half an hour while you take a walk and collect yourself. If you notice your caregiver or another parent struggling, be supportive and suggest a safe place they can take the baby when they need a break. Like babies, sometimes parents and caregivers just need to cry and be comforted. If you suspect someone of shaking a baby, call your local police or the Childhelp National Child Abuse Hotline at 800-4-A-Child (800-422-4453). Shaken Baby Syndrome Complications Forcibly shaking a baby, even briefly, can cause permanent brain damage. The results of shaken baby syndrome can be serious and long-lasting, and include: Partial or total blindness Delays in development, learning problems, or behavior issues Intellectual disabilities Seizure disorders Cerebral palsy Most of these complications require lifelong care. Raising a Child with Shaken Baby Syndrome A child with shaken baby syndrome may need help from different types of doctors as they grow up. Those specialists might include: Neurologists, who treat the brain Neurosurgeons, who operate on the brain Ophthalmologists, who treat eye conditions Endocrinologists, who treat hormone problems A child with shaken baby syndrome might also need speech, physical, and occupational therapy. When they reach school age, they may need special education. As adults, they still may need help with daily living activities like getting dressed. Survivors and caretakers of those with shaken baby syndrome may be eligible for crime victim assistance programs. The National Center on Shaken Baby Syndrome maintains a list of resources for caretakers and survivors of shaken baby syndrome. The list includes: Crime victim assistance groups Disability resources Shaken baby support groups Researchers who have studied survivors of shaken baby syndrome found that even though they may deal with lifelong disabilities, they can thrive when they receive the right kinds of support. Takeaways Shaken baby syndrome is a type of abusive head trauma. It is the leading cause of child abuse deaths in children younger than 5. It happens when someone forcefully shakes a baby or young child, damaging the brain. It can lead to learning disabilities, vision problems or blindness, and hearing and speech problems. It can cause permanent disability and death. Shaken Baby Syndrome FAQs Can I accidentally give my child shaken baby syndrome? The force required to cause shaken baby syndrome makes it very unlikely to happen by accident. You can't cause it by bouncing your baby on your knee or taking them along for a run in a jogging stroller. How common is shaken baby syndrome? In the U.S., there are about 1,300 cases of shaken baby syndrome each year."
23,What is Shigella?,"You may feel a sharp cramp in your stomach and lower abdomen . Then, you may have the urge to use the bathroom -- as many as 10 to 30 times a day when you have shigellosis, a type of food poisoning . Caused by a group of bacteria called shigella, this infection can cause belly pain, fever, and watery or bloody diarrhea . The illness is common among young children, who usually get infected at day care or school. You might also get shigellosis while you’re visiting developing countries where poor hygiene could cause traveler’s diarrhea. The disease usually goes away in 5 to 7 days with rest and fluids. But in severe cases, you may need to go to the hospital. Shigellosis is common in the United States with about a half-million cases every year. It’s far more deadly in poorer countries (about 165 million cases and about 1 million deaths worldwide every year). How Do You Get Shigellosis? The Shigella bacteria pass through your stomach and then multiply in your small intestines . They then spread into your large intestines (also known as colon ), causing cramping in that part of your body, along with diarrhea. Shigella leaves the body through human feces. The disease spreads when bacteria from the stool of the sick person go to the mouth of another person. You may be wondering: How on earth does that happen? Shigella spreads more easily than you might think. Here are some ways: Touching objects. For example, you may change the diaper of a child who has shigellosis. If you don’t wash your hands thoroughly, you could leave the bacteria behind on objects you touch next, such as changing tables, toys, and doorknobs. The people who touch those infected surfaces can get infected -- especially if they touch their mouths or swallow something using their contaminated hands. Eating. People handling or preparing your food may have shigellosis. If their hands aren’t clean, your food may be tainted. Or your fruits and vegetables may have been growing on a field that has been contaminated with human feces. Swallowing water. You could go swimming in pool or pond and get water in your mouth that’s been contaminated by feces. Sexual contact. You could get exposed during sexual activity when it involves oral-anal contact. What Are the Symptoms? The main symptom is diarrhea. The stools may be bloody or contain mucus. Other symptoms you or your child may get include: Nausea Vomiting Fever Cramping in your stomach and abdominal area Tenesmus (the feeling that you need to go to the bathroom even when there is nothing left in your intestines) For people with mild cases, you can expect your symptoms to clear up without drugs in a week. But shigellosis can be worse on seniors, infants or people who have chronic illnesses that have weakened their immune systems ( HIV , for example). You should call your doctor if: Your diarrhea is severe, especially if you spot blood or mucus You have a fever You have signs of dehydration such as dry mouth , lips or lightheadedness Not everyone with shigellosis get symptoms. Although you may not have symptoms, you are still infectious and could spread the disease to other people. Does It Cause Other Problems? You could have lingering effects after a shigella infection, though such cases are rare. Problems may include: Dehydration . This is when you don’t have enough fluid in your system. You could be lightheaded, dizzy, lack tears, and sunken eyes . Watch for dry diapers in children. Post- infectious arthritis . This is joint pain (in ankles , knees , feet, hips). You could also get eye irritations and painful urination . This occurs to about 2% of people who get infected with shigella flexneri, a type of shigella bacteria. Bloodstream infection. When the lining of the intestines gets damaged during the sickness, shigella or other germs in your gut could infect your bloodstream. These infections are more common among people with other illnesses, such as HIV , cancer, or malnutrition. Hemolytic-uremic syndrome ( HUS ): This infection produces a toxin that destroys red blood cells , which are cells in your blood that carry oxygen. Seizures : This is more commonly seen in young children. Call 911 at once if your child has a seizure. How Is it Diagnosed? Since there are many causes of diarrhea, a lab test may be needed to figure out whether you have shigellosis. Your doctor may ask you to give a stool sample to see whether you have shigella bacteria. The lab can run more tests to find out which antibiotic would be the most effective. What's the Treatment? In most cases, you can recover from shigellosis by resting and drinking fluids to replace what you’ve lost from diarrhea. Avoid drugs that stop diarrhea or slow down the gut. Drugs such as diphenoxylate with atropine ( Lomotil ) or loperamide (Imodium) can make shigellosis worse. In severe cases, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics to shorten the illness. This may be for seniors, infants, or people who have other diseases. Some shigella bacteria are resistant to antibiotics , so the treatment may not work. Tell your doctor if prescription antibiotics don’t make you feel better after you’ve taken them for several days. Can I Prevent Shigellosis? There is no vaccine or cure, so the key is good hygiene. Wash your hands well with warm water and soap, especially after using the bathroom or changing diapers, and before preparing food or eating. Also make sure young children wash their hands after using bathroom. Some other tips: Keep children with diarrhea out of day care or school. Don’t drink water from a pool, lake, or pond. Eat only boiled, cooked, or peeled food while traveling abroad. Wash your hands even more when traveling abroad. Wrap up soiled diapers properly and put them in a trash can. Avoid having sex with someone who had diarrhea recently."
24,Hypovolemic Shock,"What Is Hypovolemic Shock? Hypovolemic shock is a dangerous condition that happens when you suddenly lose a lot of blood or fluids from your body. This drops your blood volume, the amount of blood circulating in your body. That’s why it’s also known as low-volume shock. Hypovolemic shock is a life-threatening emergency. Blood helps hold your body temperature steady, forms blood clots , and moves oxygen and nutrients to all of your cells. If your blood volume gets too low, your organs won't be able to keep working. The most common cause of hypovolemic shock is blood loss when a major blood vessel bursts or when you’re seriously injured. This is called hemorrhagic shock. You can also get it from heavy bleeding related to pregnancy , from burns , or even from severe vomiting and diarrhea . Hypovolemic Shock Signs and Symptoms How hypovolemic shock shows up can depend on a number of things, including: Your age Your past medical care and overall health The cause of the shock or the source of the injury How quickly you lost the blood or fluids How much your blood volume has dropped With an injury, the most obvious sign of hypovolemic shock is a lot of bleeding. But you won't see it when the bleeding is happening inside your body because of an aortic aneurysm , organ damage, or ectopic pregnancy . Other signs of hypovolemic shock include: Rapid heartbeat Quick, shallow breathing Feeling weak Being tired Confusion or wooziness Having little or no pee Low blood pressure Cool, clammy skin Hypovolemic Shock Causes Causes of hypovolemic shock that involve bleeding include: Broken bones around your hips Cuts on your head and neck Damage to organs in your belly, including your spleen , liver , and kidneys , because of a car accident or a bad fall A tear in your heart or a large blood vessel, or a weakened spot in a large blood vessel that could burst Problems with your digestive tract, such as ulcers An embryo growing outside a woman’s uterus (ectopic pregnancy) The placenta peeling away from the wall of a pregnant woman’s uterus (placental abruption) A ruptured ovarian cyst Heavy bleeding during labor or delivery, or in the following 24 hours A disorder in which the tissue that usually lines a woman’s uterus grows outside it (endometriosis) Causes that don’t involve bleeding include: Dehydration Diarrhea and vomiting High fever Severe sweating Other gastrointestinal problems like stoma or fistulas Kidney disease and diuretics Fluids getting stuck in one part of your body because of a condition like pancreatitis or intestinal blockage Hypovolemic Shock Stages There are four stages of hypovolemic shock: Loss of up to 750 cubic centimeters (cc) or milliliters (mL) of blood, up to 15% of your total volume. Your blood vessels narrow slightly to keep blood pressure up. Your heart rate is normal, and your body makes as much urine as usual. Loss of 750 to 1,500 cc of blood. Your heart rate rises. Your body starts to pull blood away from your limbs and intestines and sends it to vital organs like your heart and brain. Your blood pressure and urine are regular, but you may feel some anxiety. Loss of 1,500 to 2,000 cc of blood, about a half-gallon. Your blood pressure drops. Your body stops making as much pee. Your limbs are cold and clammy, and your skin is pale. You may become confused or flustered. Loss of more than 2,000 cc of blood, more than 40% of your total blood volume. Your heart is racing, but you feel sluggish. Your blood pressure is very low. Your body is making little or no pee. Hypovolemic Shock Diagnosis Your doctor will check your temperature, pulse, breathing, and blood pressure. They'll check the color and feel of your skin. If you're awake and alert, they'll ask about past medical issues and your overall health. If you could be in shock because of an ectopic pregnancy or something else related to your reproductive organs, the health care team will also do a pregnancy test and ask about your last menstrual period and any recent vaginal bleeding . You may need more tests, including: Imaging studies such as X-rays, ultrasounds, or CT scans Blood and urine tests Heart tests like echocardiogram and electrocardiogram (ECG) Hypovolemic Shock Treatment The first step is to get you to the emergency room as quickly as possible. Along the way, someone should try to stop any visible bleeding. Your medical team will try to: Get as much oxygen as possible to all parts of your body Stop, or at least control, blood loss Replace blood and other fluids You’ll get fluids through an IV, a bag of liquid attached to a needle that goes directly into a vein. Most people who lose more than 30% of their blood volume will also need a blood transfusion . Many will need some kind of surgery, especially if they have internal or gynecological bleeding. Hypovolemic Shock Complications Hypovolemic shock can lead to complications such as: Infection (if you were injured) Damage to your kidneys and other organs Death Hypovolemic Shock Outlook The outcome depends on how serious your condition is when you start treatment, how much blood you lost, how quickly blood and fluids are replaced, and whether you have any other issues or complications."
25,Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS),"What Is Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome? Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a condition that causes fluid to build up in your lungs so oxygen can’t get to your organs. Fluid leaks from small blood vessels and collects in tiny air sacs in your lungs so they can’t fill with enough air. Because of this, your blood can’t pick up the oxygen it needs to carry to the rest of your body. Organs such as your kidneys or brain might not work the way they should or might shut down. ARDS is sometimes life-threatening and can get worse quickly. But it’s generally treatable, and most people recover. Fast diagnosis and treatment are important. ARDS Causes and Risk Factors ARDS is usually triggered by another health problem, so most people who have it are already in the hospital for something else. Causes of ARDS include: Sepsis . This is when you get an infection in your bloodstream and your immune system goes into overdrive, causing inflammation , small blood clots , and bleeding. Accidents. Injuries from a car wreck or a fall can damage your lungs or the part of your brain that controls breathing . Breathing in harmful things. Dense smoke or chemical fumes can trigger ARDS. Other possible causes of ARDS include: Pneumonia Bleeding that makes you need a transfusion Inflamed pancreas Drug overdose Near- drowning Burns Reactions to medications Breathing food into your lungs ( aspiration ) Doctors don’t know why some people get ARDS and others don’t. Risk factors include: A problem in your genes Heavy alcohol use Smoking tobacco Using oxygen for a lung condition Recent high-risk surgery or chemotherapy Obesity ARDS Symptoms ARDS puts a lot of strain on your lungs. Symptoms include: Shortness of breath Low blood pressure Unusually fast breathing Fast heartbeat Cough Fever Chest pain , especially when breathing deeply Confusion and exhaustion Blue-tinted lips or nails from lack of oxygen in your blood Dizziness ARDS Diagnosis and Tests No single test can identify ARDS. It’s more of a puzzle that your doctor pieces together. They’ll want to rule out conditions that can have similar symptoms. Your doctor will ask about your medical history, do a physical exam , and listen to your breathing and your heartbeat. They may also look for: Signs of extra fluid in your body Bluish color on your lips or skin Tests to help with diagnosis include: Imaging tests. A chest X-ray is crucial and probably the first test your doctor will order. You might also have a CT scan . These can give your doctor an idea of how much fluid is in your lungs and where it is. Blood tests. These check your oxygen level. They can also look for signs of infection or anemia , a lack of red blood cells. Heart tests . These can rule out conditions such as heart failure (when your heart doesn’t pump blood through your body the way it should). ARDS Treatment Treatment aims to get the oxygen levels in your blood up to where they should be, so your organs get what they need. In some cases, your doctor might give you an air mask and later go to a breathing tube and ventilator (a machine that helps you breathe). Your doctor will also treat other conditions that might be causing ARDS. Treatments include: Nutrition and medicine through fluids injected into your blood Medication to prevent bleeding and blood clots Medication to keep you calm and comfortable Most ARDS treatment is done in a hospital’s intensive care unit. Many people have a full recovery with no long-term problems. ARDS Complications The condition or its treatment can lead to other problems, including: Collapse of part of your lung because it can’t inflate the way it should ( atelectasis ) or because of air between your lung and your chest wall (pneumothorax) Organ damage or failure Confusion High blood pressure in the artery that goes from your heart to your lungs ( pulmonary hypertension ) Scarred lung tissue (pulmonary fibrosis) Blood clots Infection ARDS Outlook If you’ve recently had ARDS, improve your recovery by: Not smoking Not drinking alcohol Getting a flu shot every year and a pneumonia vaccine as directed by your doctor You might need to be on a ventilator for a while. ARDS can leave you weak, so you may go to physical therapy to get stronger. ARDS can be emotionally and physically tough on patients and families. A support group may help with anxiety , stress , or depression ."
26,Short Bowel Syndrome,"What Is Short Bowel Syndrome? Your bowels are made up of two parts -- the large intestine, also called the colon , and the small intestine. Short bowel syndrome usually affects people who’ve had a lot of their small intestine removed. Without this part, your body can’t get enough nutrients and water from the food you eat. This causes bowel troubles, like diarrhea , which can be dangerous if you go without treatment. If you learn you have short bowel syndrome, know that doctors can do a lot of things to ease your symptoms and make sure you get the right nutrition. People who have the disease can lead active lives. Over time, your body may adjust to having a shorter small intestine, and you may be able to take fewer medicines. The key is to stick to your treatment plan and get the support you need. Causes Adults usually have about 20 feet of small intestine. Those with short bowel syndrome usually have at least half of their small intestine missing or removed. There are a lot of reasons why this might happen. Some babies are born with bowel problems that damage parts of the intestine . Others are just born with shorter bowels. Most often, short bowel syndrome happens after surgery to remove a large part of the small intestine. Doctors may remove the small intestine as part of a treatment for: Crohn’s disease , a lifelong inflammatory bowel disease that causes belly pain, diarrhea , and other digestive problems Cancer Damage from cancer treatment , like radiation therapy Bowel injury Symptoms The main symptom of short bowel syndrome is diarrhea that doesn't go away. You or your child may also have: Cramping Bloating Gas Heartburn Weakness Fatigue Weight loss Since your body has trouble getting nutrients and vitamins from food, it can also cause: Anemia (not enough red blood cells ) Easy bruising Fatty liver Gallstones Kidney stones Bone pain and osteoporosis (thinning and fragile bones) Trouble eating certain foods Getting a Diagnosis If you’re having any symptoms and you’ve had a lot of your small intestine removed, your doctor may already suspect short bowel syndrome. To be sure, they’ll do a physical exam and may run other tests, including: Blood tests Stool exam X-rays of your chest and belly Upper GI series, also called a barium X-ray. You’ll drink a special liquid that coats your throat, stomach , and small intestine to make them stand out on the X-ray image. CT scan, a powerful X-ray that makes detailed pictures inside your body Ultrasound , which uses sound waves to make images of your organs Bone density test Liver biopsy , when doctors remove a piece of tissue for testing. Most of the time, doctors make a small cut on your belly and use a hollow needle to get the cells they need. They use a CT scan or an ultrasound to see where to place the needle. The biopsy takes about 5 minutes, but you may need a few hours to recover. Along with the tests, your doctor will probably also ask you questions about your symptoms, like: How are you feeling? When did your symptoms begin? Do you have any other medical conditions? How are your energy levels? Are you having any diarrhea? Do you have problems after you eat certain foods? What makes your symptoms better? What makes them worse? Questions to Ask Your Doctor How serious is my short bowel syndrome? Will it ever go away? What can I do to feel better? What kinds of treatment do I need? How will we know if they work? What kinds of food should I eat? Do I need tests to check my vitamin levels? If your child has short bowel syndrome, ask your doctor how you can make sure they are getting the nutrition they need to grow. Treatment Treatment has two goals: to ease symptoms and give you enough vitamins and minerals. The kind of treatment you get depends on how severe your condition is. For mild cases, you may need to have several small meals a day, along with extra fluids, vitamins, and minerals. Your doctor will probably also give you medicine for diarrhea. Treatment is the same for moderate cases, but from time to time, you may need extra fluids and minerals through an IV. For more serious cases, you may get an IV feeding tube instead of eating meals. Or, you may have a tube placed directly into your stomach or small intestine. If your condition improves enough, you can stop the tube feedings. In the most severe cases, people need IV feeding tubes all the time. Your doctor may suggest surgery, including a transplant of part or all of your small intestine. A new organ can cure small bowel syndrome, but a transplant is major surgery. Doctors usually recommend it only when other treatments haven’t worked. If you choose this option, your doctor will put you on a waiting list for a small intestine from a donor. After your transplant, you could be in the hospital for 6 weeks or longer. You'll need to take drugs that prevent your body from rejecting your new organ. You’ll need the medicine and regular check-ups for the rest of your life. Depending on your condition, there are other treatments that may help your small intestine absorb more nutrients and water. They include: Teduglutide ( Gattex ). Doctors may prescribe this hormone for adults with more serious cases of short bowel syndrome who need IV feeding tubes. L-glutamine , a powder that you can mix with water and drink. It may help your small intestine absorb more nutrients, some studies have shown. Somatropin ( Zorbtive ) , a human growth hormone. You get this medicine in a shot. It may help your intestines work better on their own, so you won’t need as much nutritional support. Antidiarrheals like loperamide (Imodium) may help, as well as antibiotics, if there is evidence of bacterial overgrowth in the intestine. It’s very important to make sure children with short bowel syndrome get enough calories and nutrients since they are still growing. Talk to a doctor or a dietitian about what kinds of food are best. Your child’s doctor will check them regularly to make sure they are getting what they need. Some people may need treatment for only a short time. They get what doctors call intestinal adaptation, when the small intestine is able to adjust to its shorter length and work as it should. It can take up to 2 years for that to happen, and most people still need treatment before their organ gets used to things. Scientists are looking for new treatments for short bowel syndrome in clinical trials . These trials test new drugs to see if they're safe and if they work. They often are a way for people to try new medicine that isn't available to everyone. Your doctor can tell you if one of these trials might be a good fit for you. Taking Care of Yourself It’s hard to deal with symptoms like diarrhea, but short bowel syndrome doesn’t have to take over your life. It's important that you keep in touch with your doctor and follow your treatment plan so you can keep things in control. You can also take steps to feel better, like: Know what to eat. There’s no single diet plan for people with short bowel syndrome, but in general, you should make sure to eat lean protein (meat, dairy products, eggs, tofu) and carbs that are low in fiber (white rice, pasta, white bread). Avoid sweets and fat. A dietitian can help you figure out what foods are best. Stay active. Exercise is good for your body and mind. Your doctor can tell you how much and what kinds of activity are right for you. If you’re using an IV for treatment, ask for one that you can carry with you. Ask for help. Family, friends, and members of your community can help you run errands, get rides to the doctor, or just let you vent about the stresses of treatment. It may help to talk to a psychologist or counselor, too. Learn from others. Support groups can be a great way to get advice and understanding from other people living with short bowel syndrome. Find a group that meets in your area, or explore online discussion boards. What to Expect By working closely with your doctor, you can keep your symptoms under control and lead an active life. Short bowel syndrome can be very serious if you don't follow your treatment plan. You can become dehydrated, and there's a chance your body won't get enough nutrients. For some people, the condition gets better, and they don’t need a lot of treatment after a while. Whether your short bowel syndrome goes away depends on your age, how healthy you are, how much of your small and large intestines remain, and whether you have another condition like Crohn’s disease. Getting Support For more information on Short Bowel Syndrome, visit the website of T he Short Bowel Syndrome Foundation . You can find out about support groups there, too."
27,What Is a Sickle Cell Crisis?,"At some point in your life, you’ll accidentally drop something into the sink. If it’s small and of little value, like a grape, it may not be an issue. You let the water run and flush it through. But if your kid slips a big piece of Lego down the drain, you’re going to have some bigger problems when it gets stuck in your pipes. That’s kind of like what happens during a sickle cell crisis . Red blood cells are usually round and have some give to them -- their shape lets them move easily throughout your body. But when you have sickle cell disease (SCD), some cells are curved -- like a sickle--and hard. Because they aren't as flexible--or deformable- they can get stuck in small blood vessels. This can happen in lots of organs like your chest, belly and joints. That's when you have.... More than 50% of people with SSD, experience acute chest syndrome because of the small vessels in the lungs. This can lead to acute hypoxia (low oxygen levels) as well as long term complications in the lungs.That’s when you have a sickle cell crisis. The stuck cells slow or even totally block blood flow, so some parts of your body don’t get the oxygen they need. That can cause intense pain that lasts anywhere from a few hours to a few weeks. But you can take steps to lower your chances of a crisis. And even when one comes on, you may be able to care for yourself at home. Symptoms The most common sign is pain that might be dull, stabbing, throbbing, or sharp, and seems to come out of nowhere. How severe it is and how long it lasts varies with different people and different crises. Some people have crises here and there, while others may have them every month. You might feel the pain anywhere in your body and in more than one place, but it’s often in your: Arms and legs Belly Chest Hands and feet (more typical in young children) Lower back You may also have: Breathing problems (shortness of breath or pain when breathing or both) Extreme tiredness Headache or dizziness Painful erections in males Weakness or a hard time moving some parts of your body Yellowish skin color ( jaundice ) Causes Typically, you won’t know why you had a crisis, and there may be more than one cause. Possible triggers include: Being at high altitudes (mountain climbing, for example) Changes in temperature, like if you go from a warm house into a cold winter day and you haven’t bundled up Infections Not having enough to drink ( dehydration ) Stress Treatment Thetr are a few drugs that can help.  The drug called L-glutamine oral powder ( Endari ) has proven to help prevent these crises from occurring and thus preventing hospitalizations. Hydroxyurea ( Droxia , Hydrea , Silkos ) and voxelotor (Oxbryta) prevent abnormal red blood cells from forming. This reduces the number of painful crises from sickling blood cells. Crizanlizumab-tmca ( Adakveo ) helps stop the blood cells from sticking together and blocking small blood cells, which can not just be painful, but can damage organs. Your doctor can help you come up with a plan for how to handle a crisis. If you need to go to the hospital for treatment, make sure to take your plan with you. Often, you can treat the pain at home. When a crisis first starts, your doctor will likely suggest you drink plenty of liquids and take an over-the-counter pain medicine, such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen . Talk to your doctor to see what’s safe for you. For example, if you have a kidney problem, acetaminophen might be the better choice. For more severe pain, your doctor may give you a stronger medicine. You can also try a heating pad, hot bath, or a massage . Physical therapy may provide some relief, too. And don’t forget to tend to your mind. Counseling , relaxation methods like meditation , and seeking support from family and friends are key steps in keeping yourself well. If you can’t manage the pain at home, go to an emergency room, where they can give you stronger pain medicine. You may need to stay in the hospital until the pain is under control. How Can I Prevent a Crisis? There’s no sure way, but you can lower your odds: Avoid swimming in cold water. Dress in warm clothes when it’s cold out or when you’re in air-conditioned buildings. Drink plenty of water. Fly only on commercial airlines. Planes that don’t control air pressure could cause you problems. Limit how much alcohol you drink. Manage your stress. It also helps to keep yourself as healthy as possible: Avoid being around people who are sick. Don’t smoke. Exercise , but drink plenty of liquids and don’t push too hard. Activities like intense weight training may put too much stress on your body. Get prenatal care right away if you’re pregnant or you’re planning on it. Manage any other health conditions you may have, like diabetes , with your doctor’s help. Stay up to date on your shots and vaccines . Tell your doctor if you have any sleep problems, like snoring . Wash your hands often."
28,Why Take a Sitz Bath?,"What Is a Sitz Bath? A sitz bath is when you sit in warm water to cleanse or ease pain around your bottom or private parts. Your doctor might suggest one if you have hemorrhoids , an anal fissure , or if you've just had a baby. You can easily draw one in your own bathtub. The word sitz comes from the German word “sitzen,” which means “to sit.” Benefits of a Sitz Bath You can use a sitz bath for hemorrhoids, after giving birth, or for other issues that cause discomfort in the perineal area. (Photo Credit: iStock/Getty Images) Soaking in water at a mild temperature can speed up the healing process by boosting blood flow. It won't cure your condition, but it will soothe irritation. A sitz bath is typically used as a home treatment for the following: An anal fissure, or small tear in the skin lining the opening of the anus Constipation or diarrhea Hemorrhoids A condition that affects the prostate gland called prostatitis After a vaginal delivery After surgery on your anus or vaginal area A Bartholin cyst, which forms on the outside of your vagina A sitz bath can offer relief from soreness, itching, burning, and inflammation , but you may need other treatments as well. A pediatrician may suggest a sitz bath for a child with uncomfortable bowel movements , a skin reaction, or an injury in the genital area. Sitz Bath Instructions There are a couple of ways to take a sitz bath. You can take one in your bathtub, or you can buy a basin that lets you take one while sitting on the toilet. Some basins come in kits that help keep the water at a steady temperature. Whichever type you use, the water should be lukewarm and comfortable to the touch. You'll soak up to three times a day for 10 to 20 minutes. Depending on your condition, a doctor may suggest more. Sitz bath in the bathtub If you’re making a sitz bath in your tub: Fill the bathtub with about 3 to 4 inches of warm water. Soak in the tub for up to 20 minutes, making sure your private area is covered with water, and adding more water as needed to keep it warm. Don't add shower gel, bubble bath, or any type of soap. Don't scrub or rub the area. Afterward, gently pat yourself dry using a soft towel. You can also dry off by using a hair dryer on a cool or low, warm setting. Then clean the tub and wash your hands. Sitz bath kit Drugstores and online merchants sell sitz bath kits that include a plastic bag with a tube attached, which dispenses water into the basin. To use one: Clean the basin well. Fill the plastic bag with warm water. Put the basin on the toilet bowl, then put down the seat. Sit in the basin, then use the tube to fill it with enough water to cover the area. As the water cools down, add more from the bag. When you're finished, clean and dry the basin and wash your hands. If you’re using a basin that doesn't include a water supply, simply pour warm water into it before you sit on the toilet. Sitz Bath Complications Sitz baths are generally safe, with little risk of complications. Scrubbing the anal or perineal area (the space between your bottom and your genitals) during a sitz bath could irritate it. Adding bath salts, bubble bath, or soap to your sitz bath might lead to minor inflammation. It's rare, but there's a chance that you could get an infection in your perineal area after taking a sitz bath. This might happen if you've recently had surgery, if you take a sitz bath in a dirty tub or basin, or if someone else also uses your sitz bath basin. If you notice redness or swelling,  call your doctor right away and stop taking sitz baths."
29,"Sjogren's Syndrome: Causes, Symptoms, and Treatment Options","What Is Sjogren's Syndrome? Sjogren's syndrome is an autoimmune disease that causes your immune system to go haywire and attack healthy cells instead of invading bacteria or viruses. Your white blood cells, which normally protect you from germs, attack the glands that are in charge of making moisture. When that happens, the glands can't produce tears and saliva, so your eyes, mouth, and other parts of your body dry out. There are treatments that bring relief, though. It's natural to worry when you learn you've got a lifelong disease that will need regular care. Keep in mind that most people with Sjogren's stay healthy and don't have serious problems. You should be able to keep doing all the things you love to do without making many changes. Sjogren's Syndrome Causes and Risk Factors Doctors don't know the exact cause. You may have genes that put you at risk. An infection with a bacteria or virus may be a trigger that sets the disease in motion. For example, let's say you have a defective gene that's linked to Sjogren's and then you get an infection. Your immune system swings into action. White blood cells normally lead the attack against the germs. But because of your faulty gene, your white blood cells target healthy cells in the glands that make saliva and tears. There's no letup in the fight, so your symptoms will keep going unless you get treatment. Some other things can make you more likely to have Sjogren's, including: Age. Sjogren's usually affects people over 40, but younger adults and children can get it, too. Sex. Women are 10 times more likely to have Sjogren's than men. Other autoimmune issues. Nearly half of all people who have Sjogren's also have another autoimmune condition, like lupus or rheumatoid arthritis . Sjogren's Syndrome Symptoms Sjogren's syndrome symptoms can vary from person to person. You may have just one or two, or you may have many. By far, the most common Sjogren's syndrome warning signs are: Dry mouth that may have a chalky feeling or feel like cotton. You might have trouble swallowing or talking. In the long run, this can contribute to cavities or other tooth problems, as well as mouth infections like candidiasis (thrush). Dry eyes that may burn, itch, or feel gritty. This can lead to light sensitivity or blurred eyesight. You might have one or both of these issues. You could have other symptoms, too, including: Dry throat, lips, or skin Dryness in your nose A change in taste or smell Swollen glands in your neck and face Skin rashes and sensitivity to UV light Dry cough or shortness of breath Feeling tired Trouble concentrating or remembering things Headache Dryness in the vagina Swelling, pain, and stiffness in your joints Muscle pain or weakness H eartburn, a sensation of burning that moves from your stomach to your chest Acid reflux, when your stomach a cid flows back into your throat Numbness or tingling in some parts of your body Trouble breathing The pain and fatigue of Sjogren's syndrome may be serious enough to interfere with your daily life. Sjogren's Syndrome Types You might hear your doctor talk about a couple of types of Sjogren's disease: Primary Sjogren's syndrome. This means you have it without any other autoimmune rheumatic disease. Secondary Sjogren's syndrome. This term is used to describe Sjogren's that occurs along with another autoimmune or rheumatic disease, such as rheumatoid arthritis , scleroderma, or lupus . Sjogren's Syndrome Diagnosis Because so many people with Sjogren's also have another autoimmune disease and Sjogren's symptoms sometimes look a lot like some other diseases, like fibromyalgia or chronic fatigue syndrome, it can sometimes be hard for your doctor to give you a diagnosis. To get clues, your doctor will give you a physical exam and may ask you questions such as: Do your eyes itch or burn often? Are you getting a lot of cavities in your teeth ? Does your mouth get dry? How about your lips? Do you have stiff or painful joints? Your doctor may ask you to get some blood tests. They will take some blood from your vein and send it to a lab to get checked. The blood tests measure the levels of the types of blood cells you have and can show if you have germ-fighting proteins (antibodies) that many people with Sjogren's have. They can also measure inflammation in your body and the amount of certain proteins called immunoglobulins that are part of your body's infection-fighting system. High levels of these can be signs that you have the disease . Your blood tests can also give your doctor an idea of how well your liver is working and show if there might be any issues with it. Your doctor also may recommend a few tests related to your eyes and mouth: Schirmer tear test. This measures how dry your eyes are. Your doctor will put a small piece of paper under your lower eyelid to see how much your eye tears up. Slit lamp. Your doctor uses this magnifying device to get a close look at the surface of your eye. Dye tests. Your doctor puts drops of dye in your eyes to check for dry spots. Salivary flow test. This measures the amount of saliva you make over a certain amount of time. Salivary gland biopsy. Your doctor will take a tiny piece of a salivary gland, usually from your lower lip, for testing. This can tell them if you have a rare condition called lymphocytic infiltrate, which is a buildup of white blood cells that look like bumps. In some cases, they also may suggest an imaging test: Sialogram. Your doctor uses this to show how much saliva flows into your mouth. They'll give you a shot of dye in the salivary glands in front of your ears and use a special kind of X-ray to take pictures of its flow. Salivary scintigraphy. This imaging test is used to track how quickly a tiny amount of a radioactive substance gets to all of your salivary glands. Your doctor will give you a shot of the substance then track its progress over the next hour. Questions for Your Doctor About Sjogren's Syndrome What can I do for my dry eyes? Is there anything I can do to moisten my mouth? What can I do for joint pain ? Because of my immune system problem, is it safe for me to get a flu shot? Sjogren's Syndrome Treatment You'll need to take medicines throughout your life to help you manage your symptoms. You can buy some kinds in a drugstore without a prescription, while your doctor may need to prescribe stronger ones if those don't work well enough. Eye treatments Drops called "" artificial tears "" can keep your eyes from drying out. You'll need to use them regularly throughout the day. There are also gels and ointments that you put on your eyes at night. The advantage of these thicker treatments is that they stick to your eye's surface, so you won't need to apply them as often as the drops. But because ointments they affect your vision, you use them while you sleep. If artificial tears aren't helping, your doctor may prescribe drugs for your dry eyes, including: Cequa Lacrisert Restasis Lacrisert is a tiny rod-shaped medicine. You put it into your eye with a special applicator, usually once or twice a day. Cequa and Restasis come in drops, which you use twice a day. Another treatment option for dry eyes is a procedure called punctal occlusion. This is when your doctor puts tiny plugs into your tear ducts to block them up. This keeps tears from draining away too fast, meaning they stay on your eyes longer and help your eyes stay moist. Mouth treatments To help your dry mouth, your doctor may prescribe drugs that boost the amount of your saliva , including: Cevimeline (Evoxac) Supersaturated calcium phosphate rinse (NeutraSal) Pilocarpine (Salagen) Another option is a prescription for artificial saliva to keep your mouth moist. If you get yeast infections in your mouth, your doctor might prescribe antifungal medicine. Ask your doctor, dentist, or pharmacist about mouthwashes or sprays that can relieve dryness. You might need to try several until you find a product that works for you. Get regular dental checkups, and ask your dentist if a fluoride treatment might help you. Other Sjogren's syndrome treatments Other treatments address some of the less common symptoms of Sjogren's. For instance, if you get heartburn or acid reflux, your doctor may give you medicines that curb the amount of acid in your stomach. You might take over-the-counter or prescription pain relief drugs to ease joint or muscle pain. Earwax remover that you can buy at the drugstore might help with itching ears. Your doctor may also suggest a d isease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) called hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil) to treat joint pain. It's a medication that's also used to treat malaria, lupus, and rheumatoid arthritis. It's rare, but some people with Sjogren's get symptoms throughout the body, including belly pain, fever, rashes, or lung and kidney problems. For those situations, doctors sometimes prescribe prednisone (a steroid) or another DMARD called methotrexate (Rheumatrex, Trexall). Sjogren's Syndrome Home Remedies There are a lot of steps you can take on your own to help manage your symptoms . For dry mouth: Sip water frequently. Chew gum or suck on candy to stimulate saliva flow and help keep your mouth moist. Be sure they're sugar-free so you don't get cavities. Stay away from carbonated drinks and from spicy, salty, acidic, and dry foods. They can irritate your mouth. If swallowing is difficult, stick to moist foods and sip water while you eat. Using liquid to moisten food can also help if you've lost some of our sense of taste. Brush and floss twice a day to avoid cavities. Don't use mouthwashes with harsh ingredients like alcohol . Oil pulling, in which you swish olive or coconut oil in your mouth for several minutes, may help ease dryness. Use edible moisturizing oils like coconut oil or vitamin E on dry areas of your mouth or tongue. Lip balm can soothe dry lips. Avoid smoking and secondhand smoke, both of which make mouth dryness worse. If you notice any symptoms of thrush, such as white patches in your mouth, pain, or a burning feeling, see your doctor or dentist. For dry eyes, nose, or skin: Avoid things that dry out your eyes, like smoky areas, drafty rooms, smoke, dust, and fans. Don't wear eye shadow or use creams on your eyelids. When using a computer, take breaks often to give your eyes a rest. Wear wraparound sunglasses, moisture chamber glasses, or goggles to protect your eyes from drying air. Before you go to bed and when you wake up, place a warm, wet washcloth over your eyelids for a few minutes to stimulate your oil glands and ease irritation. Use a humidifier or vaporizer at night to ease dry eyes, nose, and mouth. The ideal humidity rate is 55%-60%, no matter what the temperature. You might consider an heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system with a whole-house humidifier. Try a nasal saline spray or gel for dry nose. Use warm water, not hot, when you bathe or shower if you have dry skin. Instead of using a towel after showering, let yourself ""drip dry."" Your skin will absorb the moisture from the shower. Apply moisturizer every day. Tips for living with Sjogren's syndrome Like any chronic condition, Sjogren's can take a toll on your emotional health and your body. To best manage: Educate yourself. Learn as much as you can about the condition so you understand your options and know what to expect. Join a support group. It can help get in touch with others who are going through the same thing. You can compare notes about symptoms and get ideas about what brings relief. The Sjogren's Syndrome Foundation can connect you with other. Or t alk to your doctor about support groups in your area. Family and friends, too, can be a great source of emotional support. Take steps to care for your mental health. Be aware of what's burdening you, and work with a counselor or your support network to deal with these things. Keep in mind that your emotional state plays a role in the health of your body and your mind . Request accommodations. If your condition interferes with your ability to do your job, consider asking for workplace changes like extra breaks or flexible hours. Sjogren's Syndrome Complications Because you don't have enough saliva, which helps protect your teeth from decay, there's a chance you may get more cavities than other people. You could also get inflammation of your gums, called gingivitis, or yeast infections in your mouth. You also may find it hard to swallow. Dryness in your nose can lead to issues like nosebleeds or sinusitis. Dry eyes can make you more likely to get infections around your eyes that can harm your cornea. You also may notice some new issues with your vision. Other less common health conditions linked to Sjogren's include: Irritable bowel syndrome Interstitial cystitis Problems with your liver, like chronic active autoimmune hepatitis or primary biliary cholangitis Conditions that affect your lungs, like bronchitis or pneumonia Inflammation in your lungs, liver, and kidneys Lymphoma or cancer of the lymph nodes Nerve issues Sjogren's Syndrome Outlook Sjogren's syndrome is a serious, complicated, and lifelong condition that affects your entire body. It's symptoms and long-term effects vary a lot from person to person. There's no cure for Sjogren's. So you'll need to keep up with medicine throughout your life to get relief from symptoms. But the right treatment can help reduce how much your symptoms affect on your daily life. Takeaways It's hard to know what to expect when you have Sjogren's syndrome. But with the right care, you can lead an active life. A good support network can help you deal with the emotional issues that can come with this chronic condition . Sjogren's Syndrome FAQs What is the life expectancy for Sjogren's? Sjogren's syndrome doesn't shorten the lives of most who have it. But some people, particularly those with secondary Sjogren's syndrome, develop serious complications that can affect life expectancy. It's rare, but sometimes people with the condition also get lymphoma, a type of blood cancer. What are the symptoms of a Sjogren's flare? A flare-up is when you have a sudden and serious return of Sjogren's symptoms. Often, the symptoms of flares are the same ones you noticed when you first got Sjogren's, such as fatigue or fatigue . Always tell your doctor if you have a flare, especially if you have any symptoms that are new to you. Using a journal or an app to track your symptoms can help you identify things that might trigger flare-ups so you can avoid them."
30,Skin Cancer,"Skin Cancer Overview Skin cancer is the most common of all human cancers. In 2022, about 100,000 people in the U.S. are expected to be diagnosed with some type of the disease. About 7,650 are expected to die. Cancer occurs when normal cells undergo a transformation and grow and multiply without normal controls. Here are the cancer basics: As the cells multiply, they form a mass called a tumor. Tumors are cancerous only if they are malignant. This means that they encroach on and invade neighboring tissues (especially lymph nodes) because of their uncontrolled growth. Tumors may also travel to remote organs via the bloodstream. This process of invading and spreading to other organs is called metastasis. Tumors overwhelm surrounding tissues by invading their space and taking the oxygen and nutrients they need to survive and function. There are three major types of skin cancers: basal cell carcinoma (BCC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and melanoma . The first two skin cancers are grouped together as non-melanoma skin cancers. Other unusual types of skin cancer include Merkel cell tumors and dermatofibrosarcoma protruberans. Lentigo maligna melanoma. Lentigo maligna melanoma usually develops on the face or nose from a melanotic freckle, often spreading aggressively.  It is asymmetric, with jagged borders, has several colors, and can change appearance quickly. It should be treated as soon as it's diagnosed to avoid it spreading further, likely with surgery. Here are the basics on skin cancers: The vast majority of skin cancers are basal cell carcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas. While malignant, these are unlikely to spread to other parts of the body if treated early. They may be locally disfiguring if not treated early. A small but significant number of skin cancers are malignant melanomas. Malignant melanoma is a highly aggressive cancer that tends to spread to other parts of the body. These cancers may be fatal if not treated early. Like many cancers, skin cancers start as precancerous lesions. These precancerous lesions are changes in skin that are not cancer , but could become cancer over time. Medical professionals often refer to these changes as dysplasia. Some specific dysplastic changes that occur in skin are as follows: Desmoplastic melanoma is a rare and invasive form of skin cancer that represents about 4 percent of all skin melanomas. The malignant cells are within the dermis and are surrounded by fibrous tissue so they may look like a scar in texture and appearance. It is usually found in older individuals who have sun damaged skin and is most often found on areas of the skin exposed to the sun such as the face, neck, scalp, legs, and arms. Actinic keratosis is an area of red or brown, scaly, rough skin, which can develop into squamous cell carcinoma. A nevus is a mole, and abnormal moles are called dysplastic nevi. These can potentially develop into melanoma over time. Moles are simply growths on the skin that rarely develop into cancer. Most people have 10 to 30 moles on their body that can be identified as flat or raised, smooth on the surface, round or oval in shape, pink, tan, brown or skin-colored, and no larger than a quarter-inch across. If a mole on your body looks different from the others, ask your health care provider to take a look at it. Junctional nevi. A junctional nevus involves both the outer (epiderrmis)and inner (dermis layers of skin. They are usually brown to dark brown in color and round with a uniform shape. Dysplastic nevi, or abnormal moles, are not cancer, but they can become cancer. People sometimes have as many as 100 or more dysplastic nevi, which are usually irregular in shape, with notched or fading borders. Some may be flat or raised, and the surface may be smooth or rough (""pebbly""). They are often large, at a quarter-inch across or larger, and are typically of mixed color, including pink, red, tan, and brown. Recent studies show the number of skin cancer cases in the U.S. growing at an alarming rate. Fortunately, increased awareness on the part of Americans and their health care providers has resulted in earlier diagnosis and improved outcomes. Skin Cancer Causes Ultraviolet (UV) light exposure, most commonly from sunlight, is overwhelmingly the most frequent cause of skin cancer . Other important causes of skin cancer include the following: Use of tanning booths Immunosuppression, or impairment of the immune system Exposure to unusually high levels of radiation , such as from X-rays Contact with certain chemicals, such as arsenic (miners, sheep shearers, and farmers) and hydrocarbons in tar, oils, and soot (which may cause squamous cell carcinoma) The following people are at the greatest risk of skin cancer: People with fair skin, especially types that freckle, sunburn easily, or become painful in the sun People with light (blond or red) hair and blue or green eyes Those with certain genetic disorders that deplete skin pigment , such as albinism and xeroderma pigmentosum (a disease in which DNA repair mechanisms, especially in response to ultraviolet light, is impaired) People who have already been treated for skin cancer People with numerous moles, unusual moles, or large moles that were present at birth People with close family members who have developed skin cancer People who had at least one severe sunburn early in life People with burns unrelated to sunburn People with indoor occupations and outdoor recreational habits Basal cell carcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas are more common in older people. Melanomas are one of the most common cancers in younger people, especially in people ages 25 to 29. The risk of melanoma rises with age. Skin Cancer Symptoms Skin cancer symptoms depend on the type of skin cancer that has developed. A basal cell carcinoma (BCC) usually looks like a raised, smooth, pearly bump on the sun-exposed skin of the head, neck, or shoulders. Others signs include: Small blood vessels may be visible within the tumor. A central depression with crusting and bleeding (ulceration) frequently develops. A BCC often appears as a sore that does not heal. A squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is commonly a well-defined, red, scaling, thickened bump on sun-exposed skin. It may ulcerate and bleed, and left untreated, may develop into a large mass. The majority of malignant or cancerous melanomas are brown-to-black pigmented lesions. Other signs of a cancerous melanoma include: A change in size, shape, color, or elevation of a mole The appearance of a new mole during adulthood, or new pain, itching , ulceration, or bleeding of an existing mole The following easy-to-remember guideline, ""ABCDE,"" is useful for identifying malignant melanoma: A symmetry -- One side of the lesion does not look like the other. B order irregularity -- Margins may be notched or irregular. C olor -- Melanomas are often a mixture of black, tan, brown, blue, red, or white. D iameter -- Cancerous lesions can be larger than 6 mm across (about the size of a pencil eraser), although with early detection they will not reach this size. E volution -- has a mole changed over time? When to Seek Medical Care for Skin Cancer Many people, especially those who have fair coloring or have had extensive sun exposure, periodically check their entire body for suspicious moles and lesions. Have your primary health care provider or a dermatologist check any moles or spots that concern you. See your health care provider to check your skin if you notice any changes in the size, shape, color, or texture of pigmented areas (such as darker or a change in areas of skin or moles). If you have skin cancer, your skin specialist (dermatologist) or cancer specialist (oncologist) will talk to you about symptoms of metastatic disease that might require care in a hospital. Exams and Tests for Skin Cancer If you think a mole or other skin lesion has turned into skin cancer, your primary care provider will probably refer you to a dermatologist. The dermatologist will examine any moles in question and, in many cases, the entire skin surface. Any lesions that are difficult to identify, or are thought to be skin cancer, may then be checked. Tests for skin cancer may include: The doctor may use a handheld device called a dermatoscope to scan the lesion. Another handheld device, MelaFind, scans the lesion then a computer program evaluates images of the lesion to indicate if it's cancerous. A sample of skin ( biopsy ) will be taken so that the suspicious area of skin can be examined under a microscope. A biopsy is done in the dermatologist's office. If a biopsy shows that you have malignant melanoma, you may undergo further testing to determine the extent of spread of the disease, if any. This may involve blood tests, a chest X-ray, and other tests as needed. This is only needed if the melanoma is of a certain size. Skin Cancer Treatment Skin cancer treatment for basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma is straightforward. Usually, surgical removal of the lesion is adequate. Malignant melanoma, however, may require several treatment methods -- depending on the size of the tumor -- including surgery, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, and chemotherapy . Because of the complexity of treatment decisions, people with malignant melanoma may benefit from the combined expertise of the dermatologist, a cancer surgeon, and an oncologist. Skin Cancer Care at Home Home treatment is not appropriate for skin cancer. These conditions require the care of a dermatologist or specialist in skin cancers. Be active in preventing and detecting skin cancer on yourself and others. Perform regular self-examinations of your skin and note any changes. Medical Treatment for Skin Cancer Surgical removal is the mainstay of skin cancer treatment for both basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas. For more information, see Surgery. People who cannot undergo surgery may be treated by external radiation therapy. Radiation therapy is the use of a small beam of radiation targeted at the skin lesion. The radiation kills the abnormal cells and destroys the lesion. Radiation therapy can cause irritation or burning of the surrounding normal skin. It can also cause fatigue . These side effects are temporary. In addition, topical chemotherapy creams have been FDA approved for the treatment of certain low-risk nonmelanoma skin cancers. Patients with advanced or many basal cell carcinomas are sometimes prescribed oral pills to block the growth of these cancers. Side effects include muscle spasms, hair loss, taste changes, weight loss and fatigue. In advanced cases of melanoma, immune therapies, vaccines , or chemotherapy may be used. These treatments are typically offered as clinical trials . Clinical trials are studies of new therapies to see if they can be tolerated and work better than existing therapies. Surgery for Skin Cancer Small skin cancer lesions may be removed through a variety of techniques, including simple excision (cutting it away), electrodesiccation and curettage (scraping the tumor and then burning the tissue with an electric needle), and cryosurgery (freezing the area with liquid nitrogen). Larger tumors, lesions in high-risk locations, recurrent tumors, and lesions in cosmetically sensitive areas are removed by a technique called Mohs micrographic surgery . For this technique, the surgeon carefully removes tissue, layer by layer, until cancer-free tissue is reached. Malignant melanoma is treated more aggressively than just surgical removal. To ensure the complete removal of this dangerous malignancy, 1-2 cm of normal-appearing skin surrounding the tumor is also removed. Depending on the thickness of the melanoma, neighboring lymph nodes may also be removed and tested for cancer. The sentinel lymph node biopsy method uses a mildly radioactive substance to identify which lymph nodes are most likely to be affected. After Skin Cancer Treatment Most skin cancer is cured surgically in the dermatologist's office. Of skin cancers that do recur, most do so within three years. Therefore, follow up with your dermatologist as recommended. Make an appointment immediately if you suspect a problem. If you have advanced malignant melanoma, your oncologist may want to see you every few months. These visits may include total body skin exams, regional lymph node checks, and periodic chest X-rays and body scans. Over time, the intervals between follow-up appointments will increase. Eventually these checks may be done only once a year. Skin Cancer Prevention You can reduce your risk of getting skin cancer by following these guidelines: Limit sun exposure. Attempt to avoid the sun's intense rays between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. Apply sunscreen every day. Use a sunscreen with sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 both before and every 60 to 80 minutes during outdoor exposure. Select products that filter both UVA and UVB light. The label will tell you. If you are likely to sunburn, wear a long-sleeved shirt, pants and a wide-brimmed hat. Avoid artificial tanning booths. Conduct monthly self-exams. Skin Self-Exams Monthly skin self-exams improve your chances of finding a skin cancer early, when it has done a minimum of damage to your skin and can be treated easily. Regular self-exams help you recognize any new or changing features. The best time to do a self-exam is right after a shower or bath. Do the self-exam in a bright room; use a full-length mirror and a hand-held mirror. Learn where your moles, birthmarks , and blemishes are, and what they look like. Each time you do a self-exam, check these areas for changes in size, texture, and color, and for ulceration. If you notice any changes, call your primary care provider or dermatologist. Check all areas of your body, including ""hard-to-reach"" areas. Ask a loved one to help you check if there are areas you can't see. Look in the full-length mirror at your front and your back (use the hand-held mirror to do this). Raise your arms and look at your left and right sides. Bend your elbows and look carefully at your palms, nails, forearms (front and back), and upper arms. Examine the backs and fronts of your legs. Look at your buttocks (including the area between the buttocks) and your genitals (use the hand-held mirror to make sure you see all skin areas). Sit down and examine your feet carefully, including the nails, soles and between the toes. Look at your scalp, face, and neck. You may use a comb or blow dryer to move your hair while examining your scalp. You may also enlist the help of a friend or family member. If you are at high risk for developing skin cancer, ask you doctor about oral nicotinamide, a vitamin B3 supplement taken twice daily in pill form that can decrease the rate of new squamous cell and basal cells by almost 25%. Skin Cancer Outlook Although the number of skin cancers in the U.S. continues to rise, more skin cancers are being caught earlier, when they are easier to treat. Thus, illness and death rates have decreased. When treated properly, the cure rate for both basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) approaches 95%. The remaining cancers recur at some point after treatment. Recurrences of these cancers are almost always local (not spread elsewhere in the body), but they often cause significant tissue destruction. 2% of squamous cell carcinomas will eventually spread elsewhere in the body and turn into dangerous cancer. Metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the skin is usually seen in people with compromised immune systems. In most cases, the outcome of malignant melanoma depends on the thickness of the tumor at the time of treatment. Thin lesions are almost always cured by simple surgery alone. Thicker tumors, which usually have been present for some time but have gone undetected, may spread to other organs. Surgery removes the tumor and any local spread, but it cannot remove distant metastasis. Other therapies, such as radiation therapy, immunotherapy or chemotherapy, are used to treat the metastatic tumors. Malignant melanoma causes more than 75% of deaths from skin cancer. Skin Cancer Support Groups and Counseling Living with skin cancer presents many new challenges for you and for your family and friends. You will probably have many worries about how the cancer will affect you and your ability to ""live a normal life,"" that is, to care for your family and home, to hold your job, and to continue the friendships and activities you enjoy. Many people with a skin cancer diagnosis feel anxious and depressed. Some people feel angry and resentful; others feel helpless and defeated. For most people with skin cancer, talking about their feelings and concerns helps. Your friends and family members can be very supportive. They may be hesitant to offer support until they see how you are coping. Don't wait for them to bring it up. If you want to talk about your concerns, let them know. Some people don't want to ""burden"" their loved ones, or prefer talking about their concerns with a more neutral professional. A social worker, counselor, or member of the clergy can be helpful. Your dermatologist or oncologist should be able to recommend someone. Many people with cancer are profoundly helped by talking to other people who have cancer. Sharing your concerns with others who have been through the same thing can be remarkably reassuring. Support groups for people with cancer may be available through the medical center where you are receiving your treatment. The American Cancer Society also has information about support groups throughout the U.S. For More Information About Skin Cancer National Cancer Institute, Cancer Information Service (CIS) Toll-free: (800) 4-CANCER (800) 422-6237 TTY (for deaf and hard of hearing callers): (800) 332-8615 Skin Cancer Foundation 255 Lexington Avenue, 11th Floor New York, NY 10016 (212)754-5176 www.skincancer.org Skin Cancer Web Links For information about clinical trials in skin cancer treatment, visit the National Institute of Health's Clinical Trials database.

There are three major types of skin cancers: basal cell carcinoma (BCC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and melanoma . The first two skin cancers are grouped together as non-melanoma skin cancers. Other unusual types of skin cancer include Merkel cell tumors and dermatofibrosarcoma protruberans. Lentigo maligna melanoma. Lentigo maligna melanoma usually develops on the face or nose from a melanotic freckle, often spreading aggressively.  It is asymmetric, with jagged borders, has several colors, and can change appearance quickly. It should be treated as soon as it's diagnosed to avoid it spreading further, likely with surgery. Here are the basics on skin cancers: The vast majority of skin cancers are basal cell carcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas. While malignant, these are unlikely to spread to other parts of the body if treated early. They may be locally disfiguring if not treated early. A small but significant number of skin cancers are malignant melanomas. Malignant melanoma is a highly aggressive cancer that tends to spread to other parts of the body. These cancers may be fatal if not treated early. Like many cancers, skin cancers start as precancerous lesions. These precancerous lesions are changes in skin that are not cancer , but could become cancer over time. Medical professionals often refer to these changes as dysplasia. Some specific dysplastic changes that occur in skin are as follows: Desmoplastic melanoma is a rare and invasive form of skin cancer that represents about 4 percent of all skin melanomas. The malignant cells are within the dermis and are surrounded by fibrous tissue so they may look like a scar in texture and appearance. It is usually found in older individuals who have sun damaged skin and is most often found on areas of the skin exposed to the sun such as the face, neck, scalp, legs, and arms. Actinic keratosis is an area of red or brown, scaly, rough skin, which can develop into squamous cell carcinoma. A nevus is a mole, and abnormal moles are called dysplastic nevi. These can potentially develop into melanoma over time. Moles are simply growths on the skin that rarely develop into cancer. Most people have 10 to 30 moles on their body that can be identified as flat or raised, smooth on the surface, round or oval in shape, pink, tan, brown or skin-colored, and no larger than a quarter-inch across. If a mole on your body looks different from the others, ask your health care provider to take a look at it. Junctional nevi. A junctional nevus involves both the outer (epiderrmis)and inner (dermis layers of skin. They are usually brown to dark brown in color and round with a uniform shape. Dysplastic nevi, or abnormal moles, are not cancer, but they can become cancer. People sometimes have as many as 100 or more dysplastic nevi, which are usually irregular in shape, with notched or fading borders. Some may be flat or raised, and the surface may be smooth or rough (""pebbly""). They are often large, at a quarter-inch across or larger, and are typically of mixed color, including pink, red, tan, and brown. Recent studies show the number of skin cancer cases in the U.S. growing at an alarming rate. Fortunately, increased awareness on the part of Americans and their health care providers has resulted in earlier diagnosis and improved outcomes. Skin Cancer Causes Ultraviolet (UV) light exposure, most commonly from sunlight, is overwhelmingly the most frequent cause of skin cancer . Other important causes of skin cancer include the following: Use of tanning booths Immunosuppression, or impairment of the immune system Exposure to unusually high levels of radiation , such as from X-rays Contact with certain chemicals, such as arsenic (miners, sheep shearers, and farmers) and hydrocarbons in tar, oils, and soot (which may cause squamous cell carcinoma) The following people are at the greatest risk of skin cancer: People with fair skin, especially types that freckle, sunburn easily, or become painful in the sun People with light (blond or red) hair and blue or green eyes Those with certain genetic disorders that deplete skin pigment , such as albinism and xeroderma pigmentosum (a disease in which DNA repair mechanisms, especially in response to ultraviolet light, is impaired) People who have already been treated for skin cancer People with numerous moles, unusual moles, or large moles that were present at birth People with close family members who have developed skin cancer People who had at least one severe sunburn early in life People with burns unrelated to sunburn People with indoor occupations and outdoor recreational habits Basal cell carcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas are more common in older people. Melanomas are one of the most common cancers in younger people, especially in people ages 25 to 29. The risk of melanoma rises with age. Skin Cancer Symptoms Skin cancer symptoms depend on the type of skin cancer that has developed. A basal cell carcinoma (BCC) usually looks like a raised, smooth, pearly bump on the sun-exposed skin of the head, neck, or shoulders. Others signs include: Small blood vessels may be visible within the tumor. A central depression with crusting and bleeding (ulceration) frequently develops. A BCC often appears as a sore that does not heal. A squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is commonly a well-defined, red, scaling, thickened bump on sun-exposed skin. It may ulcerate and bleed, and left untreated, may develop into a large mass. The majority of malignant or cancerous melanomas are brown-to-black pigmented lesions. Other signs of a cancerous melanoma include: A change in size, shape, color, or elevation of a mole The appearance of a new mole during adulthood, or new pain, itching , ulceration, or bleeding of an existing mole The following easy-to-remember guideline, ""ABCDE,"" is useful for identifying malignant melanoma: A symmetry -- One side of the lesion does not look like the other. B order irregularity -- Margins may be notched or irregular. C olor -- Melanomas are often a mixture of black, tan, brown, blue, red, or white. D iameter -- Cancerous lesions can be larger than 6 mm across (about the size of a pencil eraser), although with early detection they will not reach this size. E volution -- has a mole changed over time? When to Seek Medical Care for Skin Cancer Many people, especially those who have fair coloring or have had extensive sun exposure, periodically check their entire body for suspicious moles and lesions. Have your primary health care provider or a dermatologist check any moles or spots that concern you. See your health care provider to check your skin if you notice any changes in the size, shape, color, or texture of pigmented areas (such as darker or a change in areas of skin or moles). If you have skin cancer, your skin specialist (dermatologist) or cancer specialist (oncologist) will talk to you about symptoms of metastatic disease that might require care in a hospital. Exams and Tests for Skin Cancer If you think a mole or other skin lesion has turned into skin cancer, your primary care provider will probably refer you to a dermatologist. The dermatologist will examine any moles in question and, in many cases, the entire skin surface. Any lesions that are difficult to identify, or are thought to be skin cancer, may then be checked. Tests for skin cancer may include: The doctor may use a handheld device called a dermatoscope to scan the lesion. Another handheld device, MelaFind, scans the lesion then a computer program evaluates images of the lesion to indicate if it's cancerous. A sample of skin ( biopsy ) will be taken so that the suspicious area of skin can be examined under a microscope. A biopsy is done in the dermatologist's office. If a biopsy shows that you have malignant melanoma, you may undergo further testing to determine the extent of spread of the disease, if any. This may involve blood tests, a chest X-ray, and other tests as needed. This is only needed if the melanoma is of a certain size. Skin Cancer Treatment Skin cancer treatment for basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma is straightforward. Usually, surgical removal of the lesion is adequate. Malignant melanoma, however, may require several treatment methods -- depending on the size of the tumor -- including surgery, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, and chemotherapy . Because of the complexity of treatment decisions, people with malignant melanoma may benefit from the combined expertise of the dermatologist, a cancer surgeon, and an oncologist. Skin Cancer Care at Home Home treatment is not appropriate for skin cancer. These conditions require the care of a dermatologist or specialist in skin cancers. Be active in preventing and detecting skin cancer on yourself and others. Perform regular self-examinations of your skin and note any changes. Medical Treatment for Skin Cancer Surgical removal is the mainstay of skin cancer treatment for both basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas. For more information, see Surgery. People who cannot undergo surgery may be treated by external radiation therapy. Radiation therapy is the use of a small beam of radiation targeted at the skin lesion. The radiation kills the abnormal cells and destroys the lesion. Radiation therapy can cause irritation or burning of the surrounding normal skin. It can also cause fatigue . These side effects are temporary. In addition, topical chemotherapy creams have been FDA approved for the treatment of certain low-risk nonmelanoma skin cancers. Patients with advanced or many basal cell carcinomas are sometimes prescribed oral pills to block the growth of these cancers. Side effects include muscle spasms, hair loss, taste changes, weight loss and fatigue. In advanced cases of melanoma, immune therapies, vaccines , or chemotherapy may be used. These treatments are typically offered as clinical trials . Clinical trials are studies of new therapies to see if they can be tolerated and work better than existing therapies. Surgery for Skin Cancer Small skin cancer lesions may be removed through a variety of techniques, including simple excision (cutting it away), electrodesiccation and curettage (scraping the tumor and then burning the tissue with an electric needle), and cryosurgery (freezing the area with liquid nitrogen). Larger tumors, lesions in high-risk locations, recurrent tumors, and lesions in cosmetically sensitive areas are removed by a technique called Mohs micrographic surgery . For this technique, the surgeon carefully removes tissue, layer by layer, until cancer-free tissue is reached. Malignant melanoma is treated more aggressively than just surgical removal. To ensure the complete removal of this dangerous malignancy, 1-2 cm of normal-appearing skin surrounding the tumor is also removed. Depending on the thickness of the melanoma, neighboring lymph nodes may also be removed and tested for cancer. The sentinel lymph node biopsy method uses a mildly radioactive substance to identify which lymph nodes are most likely to be affected. After Skin Cancer Treatment Most skin cancer is cured surgically in the dermatologist's office. Of skin cancers that do recur, most do so within three years. Therefore, follow up with your dermatologist as recommended. Make an appointment immediately if you suspect a problem. If you have advanced malignant melanoma, your oncologist may want to see you every few months. These visits may include total body skin exams, regional lymph node checks, and periodic chest X-rays and body scans. Over time, the intervals between follow-up appointments will increase. Eventually these checks may be done only once a year. Skin Cancer Prevention You can reduce your risk of getting skin cancer by following these guidelines: Limit sun exposure. Attempt to avoid the sun's intense rays between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. Apply sunscreen every day. Use a sunscreen with sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 both before and every 60 to 80 minutes during outdoor exposure. Select products that filter both UVA and UVB light. The label will tell you. If you are likely to sunburn, wear a long-sleeved shirt, pants and a wide-brimmed hat. Avoid artificial tanning booths. Conduct monthly self-exams. Skin Self-Exams Monthly skin self-exams improve your chances of finding a skin cancer early, when it has done a minimum of damage to your skin and can be treated easily. Regular self-exams help you recognize any new or changing features. The best time to do a self-exam is right after a shower or bath. Do the self-exam in a bright room; use a full-length mirror and a hand-held mirror. Learn where your moles, birthmarks , and blemishes are, and what they look like. Each time you do a self-exam, check these areas for changes in size, texture, and color, and for ulceration. If you notice any changes, call your primary care provider or dermatologist. Check all areas of your body, including ""hard-to-reach"" areas. Ask a loved one to help you check if there are areas you can't see. Look in the full-length mirror at your front and your back (use the hand-held mirror to do this). Raise your arms and look at your left and right sides. Bend your elbows and look carefully at your palms, nails, forearms (front and back), and upper arms. Examine the backs and fronts of your legs. Look at your buttocks (including the area between the buttocks) and your genitals (use the hand-held mirror to make sure you see all skin areas). Sit down and examine your feet carefully, including the nails, soles and between the toes. Look at your scalp, face, and neck. You may use a comb or blow dryer to move your hair while examining your scalp. You may also enlist the help of a friend or family member. If you are at high risk for developing skin cancer, ask you doctor about oral nicotinamide, a vitamin B3 supplement taken twice daily in pill form that can decrease the rate of new squamous cell and basal cells by almost 25%. Skin Cancer Outlook Although the number of skin cancers in the U.S. continues to rise, more skin cancers are being caught earlier, when they are easier to treat. Thus, illness and death rates have decreased. When treated properly, the cure rate for both basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) approaches 95%. The remaining cancers recur at some point after treatment. Recurrences of these cancers are almost always local (not spread elsewhere in the body), but they often cause significant tissue destruction. 2% of squamous cell carcinomas will eventually spread elsewhere in the body and turn into dangerous cancer. Metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the skin is usually seen in people with compromised immune systems. In most cases, the outcome of malignant melanoma depends on the thickness of the tumor at the time of treatment. Thin lesions are almost always cured by simple surgery alone. Thicker tumors, which usually have been present for some time but have gone undetected, may spread to other organs. Surgery removes the tumor and any local spread, but it cannot remove distant metastasis. Other therapies, such as radiation therapy, immunotherapy or chemotherapy, are used to treat the metastatic tumors. Malignant melanoma causes more than 75% of deaths from skin cancer. Skin Cancer Support Groups and Counseling Living with skin cancer presents many new challenges for you and for your family and friends. You will probably have many worries about how the cancer will affect you and your ability to ""live a normal life,"" that is, to care for your family and home, to hold your job, and to continue the friendships and activities you enjoy. Many people with a skin cancer diagnosis feel anxious and depressed. Some people feel angry and resentful; others feel helpless and defeated. For most people with skin cancer, talking about their feelings and concerns helps. Your friends and family members can be very supportive. They may be hesitant to offer support until they see how you are coping. Don't wait for them to bring it up. If you want to talk about your concerns, let them know. Some people don't want to ""burden"" their loved ones, or prefer talking about their concerns with a more neutral professional. A social worker, counselor, or member of the clergy can be helpful. Your dermatologist or oncologist should be able to recommend someone. Many people with cancer are profoundly helped by talking to other people who have cancer. Sharing your concerns with others who have been through the same thing can be remarkably reassuring. Support groups for people with cancer may be available through the medical center where you are receiving your treatment. The American Cancer Society also has information about support groups throughout the U.S. For More Information About Skin Cancer National Cancer Institute, Cancer Information Service (CIS) Toll-free: (800) 4-CANCER (800) 422-6237 TTY (for deaf and hard of hearing callers): (800) 332-8615 Skin Cancer Foundation 255 Lexington Avenue, 11th Floor New York, NY 10016 (212)754-5176 www.skincancer.org Skin Cancer Web Links For information about clinical trials in skin cancer treatment, visit the National Institute of Health's Clinical Trials database.

32,What's the Treatment for Nonmelanoma Skin Cancer?,"If you’ve just been diagnosed with nonmelanoma skin cancer , be glad you and your doctor caught it. Most of the time it’s curable, especially when it’s found and treated early. And you have a number of treatment options to choose from, depending on what type it is. But you need to talk to your doctor about the pros and cons of each one before you decide what is right for you. Localized Treatments For precancers, very small skin cancers or those at the top layer of your skin, treatment could be pretty simple. There are a number of methods that don’t require cuts or unnecessary strain to other parts of your body. Gels and creams. Chemotherapy drugs target and kill cancer cells, while immune response drugs tell your body’s own defenses to attack a certain area. There are several topical forms available of both that you can apply to the affected area of your skin. Depending on which kind you use, your treatment could last from 2 days to 3 months, and cause mild to severe irritation to your skin. Liquid nitrogen. Your doctor may suggest freezing off the cancerous skin tumor. They might have to do it a couple of times, but it eventually kills the cancerous cells. Your skin will blister and crust up, but once it heals all you’ll be left with is a scar. Surgery Basal cell and squamous cell skin cancers are the two most common nonmelanoma skin cancers. Surgery is often used to treat them. These procedures usually take a matter of minutes to an hour and only require local anesthe sia. Excision. Your doctor will use a blade to remove the cancer , as well as some cancer -free skin. This is a quick process that often requires stitches and will leave a scar. Electrodessication and Curettages. This procedure gets its name from the scoop-shaped tool called the curette. After your doctor removes the cancerous cells, they’ll use an electric needle to probe the skin around the area to kill any leftover cancer cells. You may repeat the process a couple of times during your visit, and you’ll probably end up with a scar. Mohs surgery . During this surgery, your doctor will remove thin layers of skin from the affected area and review them under a microscope to look for cancerous cells. It usually takes hours because your doctor repeats the procedure, removing a thin layer of skin and putting it under the microscope, until they no longer see any cancer cells. Mohs is common for cancers found on the face. Radiation If you’re trying to avoid surgery or if your cancer is too large, radiation might be an option. It uses high-energy rays (such as X-rays) or particles (such as photons, electrons, or protons) to kill your cancer cells. You may have radiation after surgery to kill cancer cells that might have been left behind. It’s sometimes recommended as the only treatment for elderly people or those who have health conditions that make it dangerous for them to have surgery. Radiation also might be used instead of surgery if your tumor is very large or in a hard-to-treat area (like your eyelids or the tip of your nose) and the surgery might affect how you look. To treat skin cancer , external radiation is focused on the cancerous tumor to kill or stop its growth. To help limit some of the side effects, your doctor will likely use a type of radiation called electron beam radiation because it doesn’t go deeper than your skin. The goal is to destroy as much of the cancer as possible without hurting the rest of your body. Your doctor might also use internal radiation -- putting radioactive materials inside the affected area -- to go with other treatments, especially if your cancer has metastasized, meaning spread to other parts of your body, such as your lymph nodes . Most often, the radiation is delivered by a machine. It’s a lot like getting an X-ray -- it doesn’t hurt and is fairly quick. But you may need to have several sessions. The side effects of radiation therapy include: Skin irritation Changes in skin color and texture Hair loss to the treatment site Damage to saliva -making glands and teeth (when treating near those areas) Nonmelanoma skin cancers treated only with radiation are more likely to come back than ones treated with surgery. And if you have certain other health issues, such as lupus or scleroderma , radiation therapy can sometimes make those conditions worse. Photodynamic Therapy Photodynamic therapy (PDT), also called phototherapy, might be an option if you have: Actinic keratosis , a type of precancer Basal cell cancer near the surface of your skin Bowen's disease , also called squamous cell carcinoma in situ With PDT, your doctor uses a special light along with a drug to kill cancer cells. The drug goes on as a cream that your doctor rubs onto your skin over the cancer. Then, you need to wait at least 3-6 hours for your skin to absorb the medicine. In some cases, you may need to wait as long as 14-16 hours. When your doctor turns on the light, it kicks the drug into action to destroy the cancer. You can't get PDT for cancers that go deep into your skin because the light can't reach that far. It's mainly used for cancer that covers a large section of skin or that's clustered in one area. PDT tends to work just as well as other treatments like surgery and radiation, but there are usually no long-term side effects, and it doesn't leave a scar. Other Options Your doctor might suggest other treatments based on the type of skin cancer you have, whether it continues to happen, and your overall health. These could include less common treatments, non-FDA-approved procedures, or even clinical trials . Talk to your doctor about your specific goals and concerns. After Treatment Once your treatment is complete and the affected area is healed, you need to protect your skin. Many of these treatments can make your skin more sensitive to the sun. You will need to wear a daily broad-spectrum sunscreen to all exposed skin and reapply it every 2 hours when outside or near a window, cover up with hats and long sleeves, and avoid the sun, especially from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Your odds for getting skin cancer again go up if you’ve had it before. So it’s now more important than ever to perform regular skin checks, know what raises your odds of skin cancer, and take all necessary steps to prevent it from coming back. Your doctor may even recommend twice-a-year check-ups going forward."
33,"Squamous Cell Carcinoma: Symptoms, Causes, and Treatment","What Is Squamous Cell Carcinoma? Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a very common type of skin cancer that's linked to sun damage. You can get it anywhere that you have skin. Squamous cells are flat cells that make up the outer layer of your skin. Your body constantly sheds old ones and makes new ones. But if these squamous cells mutate and start to build up, a tumor can form. SCC is a fairly slow-growing skin cancer . When caught early, it’s easy to treat. Unlike some other types of skin cancer , it can spread to your tissues, bones, and nearby lymph nodes over time. If so, treatment can become more complex. Squamous cell carcinoma is a common form of skin cancer. It tends to appear on places that are exposed to UV rays like your head, neck, chest, upper back, ears, lips, arms, legs, and hands. (Photo Credit: iStock/Getty Images) Types of squamous cell carcinoma Doctors classify SCC based on where it is in your body. In situ: This means it's only in the top layer of your skin. Cutaneous : SCC has been found in other layers of your skin. Metastatic: If you have this type, SCC has spread from your skin to other parts of your body.  While rare, this can happen if SCC isn't found early or goes untreated. Squamous Cell Carcinoma Symptoms If you sunburn easily, SCC is more likely to show up on parts of your body that have been exposed to ultraviolet (UV) rays from the sun or tanning beds, like your head, neck, chest, upper back, ears, lips, arms, legs, and hands. If you have dark skin, SCC is more likely to be found on other parts of your body that aren't in the sun, like the bottoms of your feet or on your penis or vagina. According to the American Academy of Dermatology, SCC can show up as: A rough, scaly, red patch of skin An open sore (with or without raised edges) A brown spot that looks like a typical age spot A wart-like growth A very small horn-like growth A sore growing in an old scar A smooth or sore reddish-white patch inside your mouth A red, brown, or black line beneath a nail A fingernail or toenail that seems to be shrinking Although SCC is often red or pink, it can also be: Purple Gray Brown or black (or flecked with these colors) Yellow White (if it's inside your mouth) Skin cancer can also show up differently on different types of skin. For instance: In Asian Americans, it often appears as a round, raised, brown or black growth. In African Americans, skin cancer often affects areas that don't get sun, like your palms, feet, lower legs, anus, genitals, or nails. In Latino or Hispanic people, skin cancer typically starts as a skin growth that keeps getting bigger. Or you could have a scaly patch or notice a dark line under or around a nail. Sometimes, SCC itches, feels tender to the touch, or feels numb. But early SCC often has no symptoms other than a change in your skin or a sore spot that goes away, then comes back. Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma You don't only have squamous cells in the lining of your skin. These special cells are also in many other parts of your body, including inside your mouth and throat. That means that SCC can develop in these areas, too. Squamous cell carcinoma in the mouth: Your oral cavity includes the inside of your cheeks, your gums, the hard palate (the bony roof of your mouth), underneath your tongue, and behind your wisdom teeth. Almost all cancers found in your mouth are SCC. Because they often don't cause symptoms at first, dentists know to look for SCC during exams. Squamous cell carcinoma on the tongue: If you have this type of SCC, you may notice a sore spot or lump on your tongue that doesn't go away. You could also see a thickened area or have some pain or bleeding. Squamous cell carcinoma on lips: SCC often looks like a cold sore at first. The difference is that it doesn't go away.  If you have fair skin, the sore may appear red. If you're skin is darker, it may look gray or dark brown. Squamous cell carcinoma in the throat: If SCC grows in the tissues of your larynx (the part of your throat that you use to breathe, speak, and swallow), then you may start to have a sore throat and ear pain. Squamous Cell Carcinoma Causes Being exposed to ultraviolet (UV) rays, like the ones from the sun or indoor tanning beds, is the main cause of SCC. Over time, these rays damage your skin, leading to out-of-control growth of squamous cells, which can then lead to SCC. This is why people who have the greatest risk of developing SCC have less melanin (natural pigment) in their skin, hair, and eyes. But it's important to note that anyone can get SCC, even if you never tan or burn in the sun. As much as 65% of all skin cancer in people with dark skin is SCC. Although UV rays are the primary cause of SCC, many other health conditions, like those that affect your immune system , as well as things you do on a daily basis, can make you more likely to develop SCC. Squamous Cell Carcinoma Risk Factors Factors that can raise your risk of SCC include: Older age Being assigned male at birth Fair skin Blue, green, or gray eyes Blonde or red hair Spending time outside in the sun A history of sunburns, precancerous spots on your skin, or skin cancer Tanning bed use Long-term exposure to chemicals such as arsenic in the water Bowen’s disease, HPV , HIV , or AIDS Being exposed to radiation Inherited DNA condition Weakened immune system Tobacco (smoking, chewing tobacco, using snuff) Skin injury (like a severe burn) Heavy alcohol use Chronic mouth irritation (like having cavities, overuse of mouthwash, or use of betel quid) Squamous cell carcinoma in situ: Also called Bowen's disease, squamous cell carcinoma in situ is a pre-invasive squamous cell skin cancer. This means the growth is confined to the outer layer of skin. It should be removed before it spreads and develops into a life-threatening form of skin cancer. SCC is caused by exposure to ultraviolet light. (Photo Credit: Peter Skinner / Science Source) Squamous Cell Carcinoma Diagnosis Your doctor may refer you to a dermatologist who specializes in skin conditions. They will: Ask about your medical history Ask about your history of severe sunburns or indoor tanning Ask if you have any pain or other symptoms Ask when the spot first appeared Do a physical exam to check the size, shape, color, and texture of the spot Look for other spots on your body Feel your lymph nodes to make sure they aren’t bigger or harder than normal If your doctor thinks a bump looks questionable, they’ll remove a sample of the spot (do a skin biopsy ) to send to a lab for testing. They could also do an imaging test, like a CT scan or MRI, to see if cancer cells have spread to other parts of your body. If SCC is in your mouth or throat, your doctor may also do a procedure called a nasopharyngolaryngoscopy. A very thin, flexible camera is put into your nose to get a more detailed look at structures like your vocal cords and the base of your tongue. Stages of squamous cell carcinoma Your test results will help your doctor understand how far cancer cells have spread in your body and which stage the cancer is in. That way, they can find the best treatment for you. Stage 0 squamous cell carcinoma: This is the earliest stage of SCC. Cancer cells are only in the top layer of your skin. Stage I squamous cell carcinoma: The cancer is in the top and middle layers of your skin. Stage II squamous cell carcinoma: Cancer cells are in multiple layers of your skin and around your nerves. Stage III squamous cell carcinoma: Cancer has been found in your skin and has spread to your lymph nodes. Stage IV squamous cell carcinoma: This stage means that cancer has spread from your skin to other parts of your body and/or organs. Squamous cell carcinoma vs. basal cell carcinoma Although cases of SCC have been climbing for the past 3 decades, basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is still the most common type of cancer. Both types start in the outer layer if your skin, called your epidermis. But SCC affects the upper layer of your epidermis, while BCC affects the lowest (base) layer. Like SCC, BCC often happens because of damage from UV rays and develops on sun-exposed parts of your body. But unlike SCC, BCC rarely spreads to other parts of your body. If found early, both BCC and SCC can be removed completely. Squamous Cell Carcinoma Treatment SCC can usually be treated with minor surgery that can be done in a doctor’s office or hospital clinic. Depending on the size and location of the tumor, your doctor may choose different techniques to remove it. For small skin cancers: Curettage and electrodessication (C and E) : removing the top layer of the skin cancer then using an electronic needle to kill cancer cells Laser therapy : an intense light destroys the growth Photodynamic therapy : a photosensitizing solution applied to your skin then activated with a light or daylight, or sometimes with intense pulsed light Cryosurgery : freezing of the spot using liquid nitrogen For larger skin cancers: Excision : cutting out the cancer spot and some healthy skin around it, then stitching up the wound Mohs surgery : excision and then inspecting the excised skin using a microscope; this requires stitching up the wound Superficial radiation therapy For cancers that spread beyond your skin: Lymph node surgery : remove a piece of the lymph node; uses general anesthesia Topical chemotherapy : a gel or cream applied to the skin, sometimes with microneedling Targeted drug treatment Ablative and nonablative lasers, or chemical peels How long can you wait to treat squamous cell carcinoma? It's important to treat SCC as soon as possible. When found early, it can be cured. As time goes on, SCC can spread to other parts of your body and become harder to treat. Squamous Cell Carcinoma Complications If it’s not treated, squamous cell carcinoma can spread and damage healthy tissue and organs. In rare cases, it can be life-threatening. That can be more likely if: The cancer is large or very deep. The cancer involves mucous membranes like your lips. You’ve had an organ transplant . You have a weakened immune system because of certain conditions, like some types of leukemia. Squamous Cell Carcinoma Prevention To reduce your risk of SCC, try to: Avoid the sun during peak hours (10 a.m. to 4 p.m.). If you are in the sun, cover up with a wide-brimmed hat, sunglasses, and long-sleeved shirt. Use a broad spectrum sunscreen daily -- even when it’s cloudy and raining -- on exposed skin, and reapply frequently when outside. Avoid tanning beds. Check your skin regularly for any new growths or changes in moles , freckles, bumps, or birthmarks . Pay attention to your face, neck, ears, scalp, chest, arms, hands, legs, feet, genital area, and between your butt cheeks. Call your doctor if you notice anything that looks questionable. If you work around chemicals like arsenic, coal tar, or petroleum, follow all safety guidelines to reduce your exposure. Quit using all tobacco products. If you need help, ask your doctor. Taking good care of your teeth and gums may help reduce the risk of oral cancers and have other health benefits. Don't forget to also see your dentist regularly for checkups. If you’ve been diagnosed with skin cancer , you're more likely to get it again -- so visit your doctor for regular skin checks. Takeaways SCC is a common type of skin cancer that anyone can get.

35,What Is Skin Cancer?,"Skin cancer -- abnormal cell changes in the outer layer of skin -- is by far the most common cancer in the world. It can usually be cured, but the disease is a major health concern because it affects so many people. About half of fair-skinned people who live to age 65 will have at least one skin cancer. Most can be prevented by protecting your skin from the sun and ultraviolet rays. Every malignant skin tumor will, over time, show up on the skin 's surface. That makes this the only type of cancer that is almost always found in its early, curable stages. Types of Skin Cancer Skin cancers fall into two major categories: melanoma and nonmelanoma. The most common skin cancers, basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma , are nonmelanoma skin cancers and rarely life-threatening. They grow slowly, seldom spread beyond the skin, are easily found, and usually are cured. Basal cell carcinoma, which accounts for nearly 3 out of 4 skin cancers, is the slowest growing. Squamous cell carcinoma is somewhat more aggressive and more inclined to spread. A rare nonmelanoma skin cancer is Kaposi's sarcoma , notable for its purple growths. It's related to a weak immune system and can be more serious. People with AIDS and the elderly tend to get it. Some noncancerous skin growths could become cancerous. The most common are actinic keratoses -- crusty, reddish patches on sun-exposed skin that may scratch off but grow back. The other type of skin cancer, melanoma, is a potentially aggressive, life-threatening cancer . It can start in dark skin tissue, such as a mole or birthmark , as well as in normally pigmented skin. For men, it generally shows up first on your head, neck, or between your shoulders and hips. Women tend to get it on their arms and legs. You may also find it on the palm of your hand , on the sole of your foot, under a fingernail or toenail, in mucus linings (in your mouth , vagina , or anus , for example), and even in your eye . Melanoma is usually curable if found and treated early. But it grows faster than other types of skin cancer , and it can spread beyond your skin to other parts of the body, including your bones and brain . Then it's very hard to treat and is difficult to cure. Causes Spending too much time in the sun is the main cause of skin cancer . Sunlight has ultraviolet (UV) rays that can change the DNA in skin cells in ways that lead to cancer . Sunlamps, tanning booths, and X-rays also make these UV rays that damage skin. Basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma have been linked to ongoing sun exposure, typically in fair-skinned people who spend a lot of time outside. Melanoma has been linked with blistering sunburns; just one during childhood seems to double your risk for melanoma later in life. Regularly working around certain chemicals and other things known to cause cancer may raise the odds of getting a nonmelanoma skin cancer , including: Coal tar Radium Insecticides with inorganic arsenic compounds Who Gets Skin Cancer? Skin cancer tends to affect people of light skin color because they're born with the least amount of protective melanin in their skin. The odds are highest if you're: Redheaded A blue-eyed blonde Someone with a pigment disorder, such as albinism People with many freckles or moles , particularly odd-looking ones, may be vulnerable to melanoma. It's possible for dark-skinned people to get skin cancer, but it's rare and usually on lighter areas of their body, such as the soles of the feet or under fingernails or toenails. Where you live also plays a role. Places with intense sunshine, such as Arizona and Hawaii, have a larger share of people with skin cancer. It's more common in places where fair-skinned people moved from less sunny areas, like Australia, which was settled largely by fair-skinned people of Irish and English descent. About 3 times more men than women get skin cancer. It's more likely when you're older. Most people diagnosed are between ages 45 and 54, although more younger people are now being affected. If you or any close relatives have had skin cancer, your chances go up. Treatment Finding and treating skin cancer quickly is considered a cure. The type of skin cancer you have and how much it has spread, as well as your other health issues, will help your doctor decide how to treat it. They may use one or more different ways to remove, kill, or stop the cancer cells from growing: Surgery Cryotherapy Radiation Chemotherapy or photochemotherapy Laser therapy Biologic or immunotherapy Targeted therapy If the usual treatment doesn't work or it's difficult for you, you may be able to find a clinical trial . These test new ways to treat cancers that could be more effective or have lesser side effects. Once you've had a skin cancer, like basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma, and squamous cell carcinoma, there's a good chance that you'll develop a new skin cancer within a few years, so you'll need to get your skin checked regularly to catch it early."
36,Rashes,"What Are Rashes? Rashes are unusual changes in skin color or texture. They normally come from skin inflammation , which can have different causes. There are many types of rashes, including those caused by skin conditions like eczema, granuloma annulare , lichen planus , and pityriasis rosea . Eczema is a general term that describes several different conditions in which skin is inflamed, red, scaly, and itchy. Atopic dermatitis, which can cause an itchy rash, is one of the most common forms of eczema. (Photo credit: Moment/Getty Images) Symptoms of Rashes The symptoms that come along with a skin rash depend on the cause and type of rash. Some common symptoms include: Blistering Redness Scaly or dry skin Similarity to hives Blotchiness Swelling or inflammation Itchy skin Pain Infection of the areas of broken skin Shiny, flat-topped bumps Large affected areas of skin Circular-shaped affected areas Causes of Rashes Irritants and allergens in the climate/environment can cause rashes on the skin. Other common causes include: Viral or bacterial infections Skin conditions such as rosacea or eczema Stress Skin irritants (including soaps, skin care products , or some fabrics) Personal and/or family history of allergies, hay fever, or asthma Allergic to certain medications, including those that treat high blood pressure, heart disease, and arthritis Triggering agents from other conditions, such as hepatitis B or hepatitis C Some causes and triggers for rashes are unknown. Common Skin Rash Types Some common skin rash types include those caused by skin conditions like eczema, granuloma annulare, lichen planus, and pityriasis rosea. Eczema Eczema is a general term that describes several different conditions in which skin is inflamed, red, scaly, and itchy. Eczema is a common skin condition, and atopic dermatitis (also called atopic eczema) is one of the most common forms of eczema . It can affect adults or children and isn’t contagious. The way eczema looks can vary from person to person. In adults, eczema most often affects the hands, elbows, and back of your knees. In young children, eczema often also shows up on the face, back of the neck, and scalp. Some things can trigger a flare-up of eczema or make eczema worse, but they don’t cause the condition. Hives Hives is a skin condition that causes raised, itchy bumps or welts. If you have hives, you could be allergic to something airborne or an insect bite. It can also be caused by changes in the temperature and bacterial infections. Contact dermatitis The type of rash that comes from contact dermatitis happens when your body reacts to irritants such as detergents, fragrances, and chemicals. It can cause inflammation, itchiness, and redness. Granuloma annulare Granuloma annulare is a chronic skin condition. A circular-shaped rash with reddish bumps (papules) is a common symptom. Most often, it affects children and young adults. It's slightly more common in girls and is usually seen in people who are otherwise healthy. If you have granuloma annulare, you'll usually notice one or more rings of small, firm bumps over the back of your forearms, hands, or feet . The rash may be mildly itchy. Lichen planus Lichen planus is a common skin condition that causes shiny, flat-topped bumps. They often have an angular shape and a reddish-purplish color. Li chen planus can show up anywhere on the skin but often affects the insides of your wrists and ankles , lower legs, back, and neck. Some people have lichen planus inside their mouth , genital region, scalp, and nails. Thick collections of bumps may occur, especially on the shins. Lichen planus most often affects adults ages 30-70 years. It isn’t common in very young or elderly people. Pityriasis rosea Pityriasis rosea is a common skin rash that is usually mild. The condition often begins with a large, scaly, pink patch of skin on your chest or back. Next, you’ll notice one patch of pink skin quickly followed by more. Your skin will be itchy and red or inflamed. The number and sizes of spots can vary. Pityriasis rosea affects the back, neck, chest, abdomen , upper arms, and legs. The rash can differ from person to person. Viral conditions. Rashes on the skin can be the result of a viral infection such as measles or chickenpox. Psoriasis. This skin condition causes a rash is thick and scaly and usually appears on the knees, back, elbows, genitals, and scalp. It is permanent and can be passed down from your parents. Diagnosing Rashes Diagnosing a skin rash can be hard because the symptoms can be caused by many things. Your doctor will check your skin and ask about your symptoms and may decide to diagnose your rash using tests such as: Skin biopsy. This involves taking a small bit of skin from the affected area and sending it to a lab for testing for a virus or bacteria. (see symptoms and diagnosis of eczema ) Blood test. Your doctor can diagnose certain diseases by looking at antibodies in your blood. Also, rashes can be the result of systemic conditions, and blood tests can help to check how your organs may be affected. Allergy test. These tests include skin pricks or patch tests to look for allergens. During the test, your skin is exposed to certain allergens to detect any potential reactions. Treatment for Rashes The treatment your doctor recommends will depend on the cause of your skin rash. Some treatment options include: Over-the-counter and prescription creams and ointments. You can treat rashes caused by skin conditions like eczema with moisturizers that are fragrance-free and contain ingredients such as ceramides, glycerin , and mineral oil . Medications include over-the-counter creams and ointments containing the steroid hydrocortisone (for example, Cortizone -10, Cort-Aid, Dermarest Eczema, Neosporin Eczema). These products may help control the itching, swelling, and redness linked to eczema. In more severe cases, prescription-strength cortisone creams are also used. Steroids. If you have ongoing symptoms, your doctor may prescribe topical or oral steroid treatment, which can help with itchy and inflamed skin. Topical immunomodulators. For people with mild-to-moderate eczema, topical immunomodulators can help. These medications, including brand name products Elidel and Protopic , work by changing the body's immune response to allergens, thereby preventing flare-ups. Shots (injections). Injections can be used to treat rashes that come from certain skin conditions. Dupilumab ( Dupixent ), for example, is an injectable monoclonal antibody used in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. It clears the itch quickly in most patients. Cortisone shots can also be used in more severe cases. Phototherapy (light therapy). This is another treatment that helps some people with eczema. Phototherapy uses ultraviolet light, either ultraviolet A (UVA) or ultraviolet B (UVB), from special lamps to treat people with severe cases. Risks linked to phototherapy include burning (usually resembling a mild sunburn ), dry skin , itchy skin, freckling, and potential premature aging of the skin. Your health care professionals will work with you to lessen any risks. Anti-itch products or allergy medications such as antihistamines . Antihistamines, such as Diphenhydramine or Benadryl , can help soothe the itchiness. Immunosuppressive medications. Medications including steroid shots, prednisone, or other drugs can help clear up a rash by suppressing your immune system. Complications of Rashes Rashes on the skin aren't usually problematic and respond well to treatment. Some possible complications include: Infection. When you scratch an itchy rash, it opens your skin. This allows pathogens such as bacteria to enter, putting you at risk of infection. Anaphylaxis. In addition to a skin rash, some people can have a severe allergic reaction that is life-threatening, also known as anaphylaxis. The extreme swelling that happens in anaphylaxis can close your air passages. An immediate injection with epinephrine (EpiPen) is needed to act against the allergic reaction. If you have an itchy feeling in your mouth or throat with your skin rash, talk to your doctor about the need for an EpiPen. How to Prevent Rashes There are ways to lessen your risk and prevent flare-ups such as those associated with atopic eczema : Reduce stress . Avoid scratchy materials (for example, wool) and chemicals that can be triggers, such as harsh soaps, detergents, and solvents. Moisturize often. Avoid sudden changes in temperature or humidity. Avoid situations that cause sweating and overheating. Immediately wash your hands when you come into contact with something you're allergic to."
37,"Moles, Freckles, and Skin Tags","There are several skin lesions that are very common and benign (noncancerous). These conditions include moles, freckles, skin tags , benign lentigines (liver spots), and seborrheic keratoses. Freckles and Your Skin Freckles are small brown spots usually found on the face, neck, chest, and arms. Freckles are extremely common and are not a health threat. They are more often seen in the summer, especially among lighter-skinned people and people with light or red hair . Do Freckles Need to Be Treated? Since freckles are almost always harmless, there is no need to treat them. As with many skin conditions, it's best to avoid the sun as much as possible, or use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF (sun protection factor) of at least 30. This is especially important because people who freckle easily (for example, lighter-skinned people) are more likely to get skin cancer. If you feel that your freckles are a problem or you don't like the way they look, you can cover them up with makeup or consider certain types of laser treatment, liquid nitrogen treatment, or chemical peels. What Causes Freckles? Causes of freckles include genetics and exposure to the sun. Lentigines (Liver Spots) and Your Skin A liver spot, or lentigo, is usually a flat brown patch of discoloration on your skin. These most often appear on areas of the body exposed to sun. Photo credit: Ursula Page/Dreamstime A lentigo (plural: lentigines) is a spot on the skin that is darker (usually brown) than the surrounding skin. Lentigines are more common among White people, especially those with fair skin. They're often called liver spots. Can Lentigines Be Prevented? The best way to prevent lentigines is to stay out of the sun as much as possible, especially between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher when outdoors, and wear protective clothing, such as long-sleeved shirts, pants, and a wide-brimmed hat. Avoid using tanning beds. How Are Lentigines Treated? There are several methods for treating lentigines: Cryosurgery (freezing them off) Laser surgery Skin creams such as retinoids and bleaching agents What Causes Lentigines? Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines is a very rare inherited disorder that causes spots on the skin along with eye, ear, and heart problems. Exposure to the sun seems to be the major cause of lentigines. Lentigines most often appear on parts of the body that get the most sun, including the face and hands. Some lentigines may be caused by genetics (family history) or by medical procedures such as radiation therapy . Skin Tags and Your Skin Skin Tags (acrochordons) are benign skin growths that affect about half of all adults. Doctors aren't sure just what causes them, but skin friction can play a role. A skin tag is a small flap of tissue that hangs off the skin by a connecting stalk. Skin tags are not dangerous. They are usually found on the neck, chest, back, armpits, under the breasts , or in the groin area. Skin tags appear most often in women, especially with weight gain, and in people in middle age and older. Skin tags usually don't cause any pain. But they can become irritated if things like clothing, jewelry, or skin rub against them. How Are Skin Tags Treated? Your dermatologist can remove a skin tag by cutting it off with a scalpel or scissors, with cryosurgery (freezing it off), or with electrosurgery (burning it off with an electric current). Moles and Your Skin Moles are growths on your skin, usually brown or black. They can appear alone or in groups. Photo credit: Bart's Medical Library / Medical Images Moles are growths on the skin that are usually brown or black. Moles can appear anywhere on the skin, alone or in groups. Most moles appear in early childhood and during the first 25 years of a person's life. It is normal to have between 10 and 40 moles by adulthood. As the years pass, moles usually change slowly, becoming raised and/or changing color. Sometimes, hairs develop in the mole. Some moles may not change at all, while others may slowly disappear over time. How Do I Know if a Mole Is Cancer? The vast majority of moles are not dangerous. Moles that are more likely to be cancer are those that look different than other existing moles or those that first appear after age 25. If you notice changes in a mole's color, height, size, or shape, you should have a dermatologist (skin doctor) evaluate it. You also should have moles checked if they bleed, ooze, itch, or become tender or painful. Examine your skin with a mirror or ask someone to help you. Pay special attention to areas of the skin that are often exposed to the sun, such as the hands, arms, chest, neck, face, ears, legs, and back. If a mole does not change over time, there is little reason for concern. If you see any signs of change in an existing mole, if you have a new mole, or if you want a mole to be removed for cosmetic reasons, talk to your dermatologist. The following ABCDEs are important things to consider when examining moles. If a mole displays any of the signs listed below, have it checked by a dermatologist right away. It could be cancerous. Asymmetry. One half of the mole does not match the other half. Border. The border or edges of the mole are ragged, blurred, or irregular. Color. The color of the mole is not the same throughout, or the mole has shades of tan, brown, black, blue, white, or red. Diameter. The diameter of a mole is larger than the eraser of a pencil. Evolution. The mole is changing in size, shape, or color. Melanoma is a form of skin cancer. The most common places for melanoma in men is the chest and back. For women, the most common place is the lower leg. Melanoma is the most common cancer in young women. How Are Moles Treated? If a dermatologist believes a mole needs further study, they will do a biopsy by shaving or cutting out the entire spot so that it can be looked at under a microscope. This is a simple procedure. (If the dermatologist thinks the mole might be cancerous, cutting through the mole will not cause the cancer to spread.) If the mole is found to be cancerous, the dermatologist will cut out the entire mole or scar from the biopsy site by cutting out the entire area and a rim of normal skin around it, and stitching the wound closed. Types of Moles Dysplastic nevi are bigger and more irregularly shaped than the average mole. Photo credit: Mikel Ugarte/Dreamstime Congenital nevi are moles that are present at birth. Congenital nevi occur in about one in 100 people. These moles are slightly more likely to turn into melanoma (cancer) than are moles that appear after birth. A mole or freckle should be checked if it has a diameter of more than a pencil eraser or any traits of the ABCDEs of melanoma (see above). Dysplastic nevi are moles that are generally larger than average (larger than a pencil eraser) and irregular in shape. They tend to have uneven color with dark brown centers and lighter, uneven edges. These nevi are somewhat more likely to become melanoma. In fact, people who have 10 or more dysplastic nevi have a 12 times higher chance of melanoma, a serious form of skin cancer. Any changes in a mole should be checked by a dermatologist to evaluate for skin cancer . What Causes a Mole? Moles occur when cells in the skin grow in a cluster instead of being spread throughout the skin. These cells are called melanocytes, and they make the pigment that gives skin its natural color. Moles may darken after exposure to the sun, during the teen years, and during pregnancy. Seborrheic Keratoses and Your Skin Seborrheic keratoses are brown or black growths usually found on the chest and back, as well as on the head. They originate from cells called keratinocytes. As they develop, seborrheic keratoses take on a warty appearance. They do not normally lead to skin cancer. What Causes Seborrheic Keratoses? The cause of seborrheic keratoses is unknown. They are seen more often as people get older. How Are Seborrheic Keratoses Treated? Seborrheic keratoses are harmless and are not contagious. Therefore, they don't need to be treated. If you decide to have seborrheic keratoses removed because you don't like the way they look, or because they are chronically irritated by clothing, methods for removing them include cutting them off, cryosurgery, and electrosurgery."
38,"Narcolepsy: Symptoms, Causes, Treatment","What Is Narcolepsy? Narcolepsy is a brain and nervous system disorder that affects your ability to wake and sleep. People with narcolepsy have intense, uncontrollable daytime sleepiness. They may suddenly fall asleep at any time during any type of activity. In a typical sleep cycle, we enter the early stages of sleep, then the deeper stages, and finally (after about 90 minutes) rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. People with narcolepsy go into REM sleep almost immediately in the sleep cycle and sometimes while they’re awake. Type 1 narcolepsy comes with a sudden loss of muscle tone that causes weakness and makes you unable to control your muscles, called cataplexy. Type 2 is narcolepsy without cataplexy. In many cases, narcolepsy isn’t diagnosed and therefore isn’t treated. Narcolepsy Symptoms Symptoms of narcolepsy usually develop over a few months and last for the rest of your life. What is the first sign of narcolepsy? Most of the time, excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is the first sign you have narcolepsy. In general, EDS makes it harder to do everyday activities, even if you got enough sleep at night. The lack of energy can make it hard to concentrate. You have memory lapses and feel depressed or exhausted. Other symptoms of narcolepsy In REM sleep, we can dream and have muscle paralysis, which explains some of the other symptoms of narcolepsy: Cataplexy: This can cause problems ranging from slurred speech to total body collapse, depending on the muscles involved. It’s often triggered by intense emotions such as surprise, laughter, or anger. Hallucinations : These delusions can happen at any time and are often vivid and frightening. They’re mostly visual, but any of the other senses can be involved. If they happen as you’re falling asleep, they’re called hypnagogic hallucinations. If they happen when you’re waking up, they’re called hypnopompic hallucinations. Sleep paralysis: You may be unable move or speak while falling asleep or waking up. These episodes usually last a few seconds to several minutes. Disrupted sleep: You might have a hard time staying asleep at night because of things like vivid dreams, breathing problems, or body movements. Learn more about narcolepsy symptoms . Types of Narcolepsy There are 2 main types  of narcolepsy. Which type you have depends on whether cataplexy is among your symptoms: Narcolepsy type 1. About 20% of people with narcolepsy have type 1, which includes cataplexy. Cataplexy can be mild or so serious that it makes you fall to the ground. Narcolepsy type 2. Most people (80%) with narcolepsy have this type, which doesn't involve cataplexy. It's harder to diagnose than type 1. Causes of Narcolepsy Experts don’t know what causes narcolepsy. They think it involves multiple things that come together to cause problems in your brain and disturb your REM sleep . Scientists are getting closer to finding genes linked to the disorder. These genes control the production of chemicals in your brain that may signal sleep and wake cycles. Some experts think narcolepsy may happen because your brain has a hard time making a chemical called hypocretin. They’ve also found problems in parts of the brain involved in controlling REM sleep. Narcolepsy risk factors Risk factors for narcolepsy include your age. Narcolepsy usually begins between the ages of 15 and 25, but it can show up at any age. If you have a family history of narcolepsy, your risk of getting it is 20 to 40 times higher. Narcolepsy epidemiology About 1 in 2,000 people have narcolepsy. But experts think only about half of those who have it are diagnosed, since many other conditions cause daytime sleepiness. The condition is thought to affect males and females at the same rate. But some research has suggested it's more likely in men and those who were assigned male at birth. Narcolepsy Diagnosis Symptoms of narcolepsy can look like those of other health problems. Your diagnosis might involve a physical exam and medical history. Your doctor might also ask you to keep sleep records to track of your symptoms and sleep times for a couple of weeks. Tests for narcolepsy Polysomnogram (PSG): This is done in a sleep disorder clinic or a sleep lab. It’s an overnight test that takes constant measurements while you’re asleep to record problems in your sleep cycle. A PSG can help reveal whether you go into REM sleep at unusual times in your sleep cycle. It can rule out other problems that might be causing your symptoms. Multiple sleep latency test (MSLT): This is also done at a special clinic or lab. The test takes place during the day to measure your tendency to fall asleep and find out whether certain elements of REM sleep happen at unusual times during the day. You’ll take four or five short naps, usually 2 hours apart. Lumbar puncture. You get this procedure, sometimes called a spinal tap, in a hospital or outpatient facility . A doctor or nurse uses a needle to remove a small amount of spinal fluid from your back. The fluid is then tested to check the levels of hypocretin. Low levels could mean you have narcolepsy. Learn more about how narcolepsy is diagnosed. Narcolepsy Treatment There’s no cure for narcolepsy. But treatment can help ease your symptoms and improve your quality of life. Medications for narcolepsy Drugs your doctor can prescribe to treat narcolepsy include: Stimulants to treat sleepiness Antidepressants to treat problems with REM sleep Sodium oxybate (Xyrem, Xywav) to treat cataplexy Pitolisant (Wakix) or Solriamfetol (Sunosi) to help you stay awake for longer periods Learn more about drug treatments for narcolepsy. Alternative treatments for narcolepsy There's little evidence that any alternative or natural treatment can reduce narcolepsy symptoms. But some people have found that massage therapy improves their sleep patterns. Also, one small study found that meditation-relaxation therapy reduced how often people with narcolepsy had sleep paralysis. In this type of therapy, you learn techniques to reassure yourself, shift your focus, and relax your muscles. Always check with your doctor before you try any alternative treatment. Home remedies for narcolepsy Some lifestyle changes can also help with narcolepsy symptoms: Stay away from caffeine, alcohol and nicotine. Follow a regular exercise and meal schedule. Eat smaller meals more often instead of heavy meals. Control your sleep schedule. Try to go to sleep and wake up at about the same time every day. Schedule several daytime naps, each lasting 10-15 minutes. Learn more about the latest treatments for narcolepsy. Narcolepsy Health Disparities There's little research into how narcolepsy affects different genders and racial and ethnic groups. But experts say that, on average, it takes 12 years longer for women to get a diagnosis than men. They also say narcolepsy tends to be under-reported in ethnic and racial minorities. One study found that Black Americans tended to get symptoms earlier in life and to have worse daytime sleepiness . That could mean the condition shows up differently in Black people than in other groups. We do know that Black people are more likely to have sleep disorders in general than other groups in the United States. Because sleep quality is so important to health, this is thought to contribute to overall health disparities. Complications of Narcolepsy Narcolepsy can cause problems in several areas, including: Safety When you have narcolepsy, everyday activities like driving, cooking, and operating machinery can become dangerous. It's essential to know what things make you more likely to become inattentive or fall asleep. If you have cataplexy , be aware of what tends to trigger it. Talk to your doctor about what you're capable of and the best ways to stay safe. Work and school People with narcolepsy tend to have trouble focusing and staying alert, which can interfere with work and learning. Medication and lifestyle changes can help. Accommodations like a flexible schedule and scheduled nap times may also help you perform at your best. Relationships and social life Mental fogginess, daytime sleepiness, memory problems, and cataplexy can make social interactions awkward. You might also feel embarrassed about your condition, since many people don't understand it. It can help to talk to family members and friends about your condition and ask for their support and understanding. Heart health Untreated narcolepsy has been linked to high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and heart disease . People with narcolepsy are often deficient in the protein hypocretin, which helps lower blood pressure during sleep. Also, disrupted sleep is harmful to heart health. Living With Narcolepsy Treating your narcolepsy can help you manage the condition. But even effective treatment won't eliminate all symptoms. Lifestyle changes and coping strategies are important, too. Narcolepsy diet Some people report that low-carb diets, such as the Keto diet , help with their narcolepsy symptoms. But there's little research to back this up. Some diet changes that can help include: Follow a diet that helps you get to a healthy weight and stay there. People with narcolepsy are at higher risk for obesity. And extra weight can affect the quality of your sleep. Eat smaller, more frequent meals during the day to reduce drowsiness. Avoid big meals near bedtime so they don't interfere with sleep. Reduce processed foods and added sugar. Big changes in your blood sugar levels affect your energy levels. Be careful with alcohol and caffeine, which disrupt sleep patterns. Narcolepsy cost Narcolepsy can affect you financially as well as physically and emotionally. According to one study, medical costs for people with narcolepsy are about twice as much as for those without the condition. That includes medications as well as visits to the doctor's office and emergency room . Other extra costs you might face include: Lost time or lower pay at work Expenses due to delays and problems with education Managing narcolepsy To keep yourself safe and be as productive as possible, you need to be aware of your limitations. It's also important to help others understand your condition. Try these techniques: Plan your days around the times your symptoms tend to bother you. Be open about your condition with those you interact with at work, school, and socially. Spend time outside or otherwise expose yourself to bright light during the day to help keep yourself alert. Tackle long or complicated projects in short bursts of time. Take a nap when you start to lose focus. If you feel sleepy while driving, pull over and take a nap. Tell your doctor if you notice any changes in your symptoms or side effects of your medication. Narcolepsy and your mental health People with narcolepsy are at higher risk of mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder. Not only are narcolepsy symptoms difficult to deal with, but disrupted sleep patterns are known to harm mental health. The stigma that narcolepsy often brings can increase feelings of shame and isolation. Some steps you can take to protect your mental health include: Join a support group for narcolepsy, where you can share your struggles and get ideas for dealing with symptoms. Ask your doctor to help you find a qualified counselor or therapist . Narcolepsy Prognosis Narcolepsy is a chronic (lifelong) condition. While it's not life threatening, it can be disruptive to your daily life. You may not be able to do certain things, such as swimming or driving, because they could be dangerous for you. Can narcolepsy be cured? While there's no cure for narcolepsy, most people see improvements with treatment. What to expect with narcolepsy Narcolepsy doesn't usually get worse over time. In fact, your symptoms may get better to some extent. But they'll never go away. Treatment can help you manage them, and you can also learn ways to adapt. Can you prevent narcolepsy? Because narcolepsy happens unexpectedly and doctors aren't sure what causes it, there's no known way to prevent it. Conditions Similar to Narcolepsy Some people with narcolepsy also have related problems, including: Periodic limb movement disorder ( PLMD ): Your leg muscles move without your control many times during the night. Sleep apnea: Your breathing often stops and starts while you sleep. Automatic behavior: You fall asleep during a regular activity like driving, walking, or talking. You continue the activity while asleep and wake up with no memory of what you did. Also, many other conditions can cause symptoms similar to those of narcolepsy. That's one reason narcolepsy is hard to diagnose. Other sleep disorders like insomnia and sleep apnea can cause daytime sleepiness. So can mental health conditions such as depression. Narcolepsy can also be mistaken for epilepsy or substance use disorder. A similar condition called idiopathic hypersomnolence (IH) also leads to sleepiness during the day. But unlike those with narcolepsy, people with IH tend to sleep for long periods (often 10-11 hours at a time) and have a very hard time waking up. Takeaways Narcolepsy is a lifelong condition that affects almost every area of your life. Treatment and lifestyle changes can help improve your symptoms. You also need to be aware of your limitations and adjust your daily activities to help yourself adapt."
39,Hip Impingement,"Your hip is the joint where your thigh bone meets your pelvis. It is called a ball-and-socket joint, because the ball-like top of your thigh bone fits into a cup-like area within your pelvis, much like a baseball fits into a glove. Normally, the ball glides smoothly within the socket, but a problem with the ball or socket rim can interfere with smooth motion, leading  to hip impingement or femoro acetabular impingement (FAI). It is believed to be a major cause of early osteoarthritis of the hip , particularly in those under age 40. Hip Impingement Symptoms You can have hip impingement for years and not know it, because it is often not painful in its early stages. When hip impingement causes symptoms, it may be referred to as hip impingement syndrome. The main symptoms are  ""pain"" in the groin, especially when walking or flexing the hip, and decreased range of motion in the hip. At first, you may only feel pain when you move the hip near its limits. As the condition progresses, however, you may feel pain with more subtle activities, such as sitting for a long time or walking up a hill. Pain that occurs at night or when walking on flat ground suggests that the cartilage cushioning the ball and socket has begun to break down and wear away, a condition known as osteoarthritis. Hip Impingement Causes There are two main causes of hip impingement: A deformity of the ball at the top of the femur (called cam impingement). If the head is not shaped normally, the abnormal part of the head can jam in the socket when the hip is bent. This may occur during activities such as riding a bicycle or tying your shoes. A deformity of the socket (pincer impingement). If the front rim of the socket (called the acetabulum) sticks out too far, the area of the thigh bone (femur) just below the ball, called the neck of the femur, may bump into the rim of the socket during normal hip flexion movement. In some cases, there is a problem with both the ball and the socket. Other problems that can cause hip impingement include conditions such as: Legg-Calve-Perthes disease, a disease in which the ball part of the hip joint doesn't get enough blood , which causes the bone to die. Slipped capital femoral epiphysis, a separation of the ball from the thigh bone at the upper growing end (growth plate) of the bone in adolescents. It is more common in children who are obese. Coxa vara, an unusual condition in which the thigh bone and ball do not grow at the same pace in children. This discrepancy leads to deformity of the hip joint. Hip Impingement Tests and Diagnosis If you have symptoms of hip impingement, your doctor can diagnose the problem based on your description of your symptoms, a physical exam , and the findings of imaging tests. These tests may include one or more of the following: X-ray, a test that produces images of internal structures on film. X-rays can show irregularities in the shape of the ball or top of the thigh bone or excess bone around the rim of the socket. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a procedure that uses large magnets, radio waves, and a computer to produce detailed pictures of tissues inside the body. An MRI can show fraying or tears of the cartilage, including that which runs along the rim of the socket (labrum). CT scan, a technique that combines special X-ray equipment with sophisticated computers to produce multiple images or pictures of the inside of the body. These images can be examined on a computer, printed, or transferred to a CD. A CT or MRI scan can help a doctor decide whether you need surgery. Hip Impingement Treatments Treatment for hip impingement should begin with: Resting the affected hip Modifying your activities to avoid moving the joint in a way that causes pain Exercising as recommended by your doctor or physical therapist to strengthen the muscles that support the hip Physical therapists who specialize in the hip or recovery of hip injuries can do a lot to help strenghten muscles around the hip and relieve inflammation. Taking anti-inflammatory and pain medications If these treatments do not relieve pain, your doctor may recommend hip impingement surgery. The type of surgery needed will depend on the problem causing hip impingement and how much cartilage damage has occurred. Often, surgery for hip impingement can be performed arthroscopically. This technique involves inserting a lighted scope and thin tools through small incisions over your hip instead of making a large incision. Arthroscopy is usually an outpatient surgery. This means you can go home the same day. The earlier you have surgery, the greater your chances of a complete recovery. But even if cartilage has been damaged, surgery may still reduce pain and improve range of motion. If cartilage damage is severe, however, hip replacement may be the only treatment that will relieve pain and improve function. However, there are promising experimental treatments, including one in which parts of your own blood are injected into joints to stimulate cartilage growth."
40,Herniated Disk Diagnosis,"Could I Have a Herniated Disk? Back pain can sneak up on you when you least expect it. One minute you're sitting comfortably in front of the TV, and the next you try to stand up, and -- ouch! -- a sharp pain radiates through your lower back. Could you have a slipped or herniated disk? You might. The adult spine is made up of 24 bones called vertebrae. Some of the vertebrae are cushioned by soft disks made of a jellylike substance. These disks allow you to move your spine around and bend over. But if a disk between two vertebrae starts slipping out of place, it can irritate the surrounding nerves and cause extreme pain. The condition is called a slipped, ruptured, or herniated disk. Signs of a Herniated Disk One sign may be where the pain is. Although herniated disks can happen in any part of your spine, they are most common in the lower part of your backbone (the lumbar spine), just above your hips. The pain may spread from your back to your buttocks, thighs, and even to your calves . Discomfort from a herniated disk usually gets worse when you're being active and lessens when you're resting. Even coughing , sneezing , and sitting can worsen your symptoms because they put pressure on pinched nerves. A herniated disk also can give you a feeling of tingling or numbness. The affected part of your back may also feel weak. Age also plays a role. As you get older, your disks tend to break down and lose their cushioning. That makes a herniated disk more likely. Herniated Disk Diagnosis The best way to tell if you have a herniated disk is to see your doctor. They’ll likely do a physical exam to find the source of your pain. This usually is the only test you’ll need to confirm a diagnosis. Your doctor will check your back for sore or painful spots. They may ask you to lie on your back and lift or move your legs in certain ways. If you feel pain, it’s likely a herniated disk. They may also check: Your reflexes at the knee and ankle Your leg strength How you walk on your heels and toes Whether you can feel light touches or vibrations If your doctor wants to rule out other sources of your pain, or pinpoint specific nerves that are aggravated, they may do further testing, including: X-rays. While a standard X-ray can't show if you have a herniated disk, it can show your doctor the outline of your spine and rule out whether your pain is caused by something else, such as a fracture or tumor. Myelogram. This test uses dye injected into your spinal fluid, and an X-ray to locate the pressure on the spinal cord. CT scan . A CT (or CAT) scan takes several X-rays from different angles and combines them to create images of your spinal cord and the structures surrounding it. MRI . An MRI uses radio waves, a magnetic field, and a computer to create detailed 3D images of the spinal cord and surrounding areas. MRI images can locate the position of the herniated disk, look inside it, and also determine which nerves are affected. Electromyogram (EMG). Your doctor might use these tests to see if any nerves are damaged or compressed. The EMG test uses a device to detect the tiny amount of electricity muscle cells make when they're stimulated by nerves connected to them. A needle electrode put into a muscle records its electrical activity and looks for anything that isn’t as it should be. Nerve conduction studies (NCS) are often done at the same time as the EMG. In this test, the nerves are stimulated with tiny electrical impulses by an electrode at one point on the body while other electrodes detect the impulses at a different point. The time it takes for the electrical impulses to travel between electrodes lets your doctor know whether there is nerve damage ."
41,What is Bradycardia?,"Generally, it is normal to have a slower heart rate when you’re resting. It can be a sign of good health. But if it’s too slow, it could be a symptom of a condition called bradycardia. Normally, your heart beats 60 to 100 times a minute when you’re at rest. But with bradycardia, it goes down to less than 60 beats a minute. This might not cause a problem for some people. But it could be a clue that you have an issue with the electrical system in your heart. You need to see a doctor who can figure out why it’s beating slowly and if you should get treatment. Heart Basics Electrical signals travel through the heart’s four chambers -- two on the top called the atria and below them, the two ventricles. These signals prompt it to beat in a steady rhythm. But pulses don’t always fire off as they should. This creates what’s called arrhythmias , or abnormal heartbeats. Some conditions cause the heart to beat too fast or to flutter. With bradycardia, it’s the opposite. The electrical problem slows down the time in between heartbeats. You may simply have a slower-than-normal heart rate that doesn’t cause any symptoms. The electrical activity may be working fine, just a little slower than it does in most people. You wouldn’t even be diagnosed with this condition. And even with bradycardia, you may never notice any symptoms or need treatment. But that’s not always the case. Symptoms The biggest concern is your heart isn’t doing well enough at pumping blood to all the organs and tissues that need it. When this happens, the following may develop: Lightheadedness or dizziness Confusion or a hard time concentrating Fainting Shortness of breath (with or without chest pain ) You may also find that you tire out easily with even just a little activity. If you check your heart rate and it’s regularly below 60 beats per minute, be aware of those symptoms. If you have no other symptoms, you probably don’t need to see a doctor right away. You may exercise a lot, and a slow heart rate could be a sign of how fit you are. But, bring it up at your next appointment. When to See a Doctor If you or a loved one notices mild to medium symptoms, go to a doctor quickly. If you or a loved one faints, has chest pains or trouble breathing, call 911. Tiredness, trouble concentrating, or breathing harder may just seem like part of growing older. But sometimes it’s more than that. Be sure to tell your doctor about all your symptoms. If you wear out more easily now than you did a month or year ago, let them know. Causes The chances of getting bradycardia increase as you get older, though that’s true of most heart conditions . The causes of bradycardia can vary greatly from one person to the next. The abnormal rhythm can show up after a heart attack or as a side effect of heart surgery. Other things that can lead to it: Certain medications , such as those to treat high blood pressure and other arrhythmias, or abnormal heartbeats A congenital defect , or problem you’re born with Thyroid disease , an imbalance of hormones in the body Obstructive sleep apnea , when your breathing pauses many times throughout the night Diagnosis Bradycardia can be a little hard for doctors to figure out, because it’s not always present all the time. Your heart can go in and out of slow rhythms. Your doctor will be able to make the diagnosis if you’re having a bout of bradycardia during a test called an electrocardiogram. Often called an EKG, it’s a way to measure your heart’s electrical system . If your heart rate appears normal, but you have had symptoms of bradycardia, your doctor may have you wear a 24-hour monitor. Your doctor will ask about your personal and family health histories, as well as any symptoms you’ve had. Treatment If your doctor decides that you have bradycardia, the treatment plan will be based on the likely cause of the problem. For instance, if the cause is hypothyroidism , or low thyroid function, treating that may take care of the heart rate issue. If there is no clear physical cause, your doctor may change medications that might be slowing your heart. Beta blockers are sometimes prescribed to relax your heart muscle. But if they cause you to have a really slow heart rate, your doctor might lower the dosage or give you a different drug. If these approaches don’t work and your condition is serious enough to put your brain and other organs at risk, you may need a pacemaker. A surgeon will put this small device into your chest . It has thin, flexible wires, called leads, which extend to the heart. They carry small electrical charges that help keep the heart pumping at a steady rate. If you have been given a pacemaker, listen to your doctor’s instructions about how it operates and any signs it might not be working."
42,Bowel Obstruction,"What Is a Bowel Obstruction? A bowel obstruction is a serious problem that happens when something blocks your bowels, either your large or small intestine. It’s also known as an intestinal obstruction. If your digestive system comes to a grinding halt, you can’t have a bowel movement or pass gas. You might also notice stomach pain and a swollen belly. A common type of blockage is called fecal impaction. This is when a large, hard mass of poop gets stuck in your digestive tract and can’t get pushed out the usual way. But when your bowel is blocked by something other than hard stool, doctors call it a bowel obstruction. Types of Bowel Obstruction A bowel obstruction may be a partial blockage or a complete blockage. You can also have what’s called a pseudo-obstruction. This is when you have symptoms of a bowel obstruction but nothing physically blocking it. It can happen because of problems with your gastrointestinal muscles or with the nerves that control them. Bowel Obstruction Symptoms Signs of an intestinal blockage will depend on how severe the obstruction is. But it almost always comes with belly pain, usually around your belly button, and cramping. Other signs include: Constipation Can’t pass gas Lack of appetite Nausea or vomiting A hard, swollen belly Diarrhea (with a partial blockage) If you’ve been constipated and have any of these symptoms, contact your doctor right away. They’ll let you know what to do, including whether to call 911. Many people with bowel obstructions are older and may have other serious illnesses, so a bowel obstruction may be life-threatening. You’ll most likely need to go to the hospital for treatment. Bowel Obstruction Causes and Risk Factors Your bowel could become blocked in several ways: Part of your bowel may get twisted , which can close it off and keep anything from passing through. It can get inflamed and swell up. Part of your intestine can slide into another part like a telescope (intussusception). Scar tissue or a hernia could make your bowel too narrow for anything to pass through. A tumor or other type of growth inside your bowel could block it. Damaged blood vessels leading to the bowel can cause some bowel tissue to die. In many cases, inflammation , surgeries, or cancer can cause a bowel obstruction. It’s more likely to happen in older people. Bowel obstructions can happen in your small or large intestine, but they’re more likely to be in the small intestine. You might be at higher risk if you have: Crohn’s disease Diverticulitis Hernia Colon cancer Stomach cancer Ovarian cancer Scar tissue from surgery Radiation to your belly Lung cancer , breast cancer , or melanoma that’s spread to your bowel Bowel Obstruction Diagnosis Your doctor will ask about your medical history, including whether you’ve been constipated, if you’ve had cancer , and what new symptoms you’ve had. They also may: Do a physical exam to see if you have pain in your belly , if you’re able to pass gas, or if they can feel a lump in your belly Order blood tests Order urine tests Order a CT scan or an X-ray to look for a blockage Give you a barium enema . They’ll put a special liquid that contains barium (a whitish-silver metal) into your rectum. It will spread into your bowels and show on an X-ray as a bright area. If there’s a blockage, the barium may show it. Bowel Obstruction Treatment You’ll probably need to go to the hospital for treatment. Your doctor will give you medicine and fluids through a vein (intravenous or IV). They may also run a thin tube through your nose and into your stomach. This is called a nasogastric (NG) tube. It lets out fluids and gas to ease your symptoms. Most partial blockages get better on their own. Your doctor may give you a special diet that’s easier on your intestines. Enemas of air or fluid can help clear blockages by raising the pressure inside your bowels. A mesh tube called a stent is a safe option for people who are too sick for surgery. Your doctor puts it in your intestine to force the bowel open. Some people may not need anything more than a stent. Others may need surgery after they become stable. Surgery is usually the best treatment for a totally blocked intestine when your bowel is damaged. Your doctor can treat the cause of the obstruction or take out the blocked area and any damaged tissue. If you have surgery, you may need a colostomy or ileostomy. After your doctor takes out the damaged part of your intestine, they sew the rest to an opening in your skin. Poop exits your body through this opening and goes into a disposable bag. In some cases, your intestines can be reattached after you get better."
43,What Is Small Intestine Cancer?,"Small intestine cancer is a rare disease where cells in the tissue of the small intestine change. They grow out of control and can form a mass, or tumor. The small intestine (also called “small bowel”) connects your stomach to your large intestine. Its main job is to break down and absorb food, fats, vitamins , and other substances your body needs. If you have this type of cancer , tumor cells may block the small intestine. There are five types of small intestine cancer : Adenocarcinomas . These make up an estimated 30% to 40% of cases. An adenocarcinoma starts in the lining of the small intestine. At first, it may look like a small, noncancerous growth called a polyp, but over time it can turn into cancer. Sarcoma . Cancerous cells develop in the soft tissue of the small intestine. Carcinoid tumors . These slow-growing cancers often take root in the lower section of the small intestine. They might also affect your appendix or rectum. These tumors give off large amounts of certain body chemicals, like serotonin. Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) . This is a rare form of small intestine cancer. More than half of them start in the stomach . Not all GISTs are cancerous. Intestinal lymphomas . A lymphoma is a cancer that starts in the lymph nodes. People who develop them often have a type of immunodeficiency disorder. That means your body’s natural defense system is weakened and may not fight infection and disease the way it should. What Causes It, and Who’s at Risk? Doctors aren’t really sure why people develop it. But they do know that several things can increase your chances of getting the disease: How old you are (average age at diagnosis is 60) Your sex (slightly higher risk in men) Genetics (some disorders you’re born with raise the odds) Smoking and alcohol use High- fat diet Living or working near large quantities of some chemicals, like phenoxyacetic acid Other conditions that affect your gut, like Crohn’s, colon cancer , or celiac disease Lymphedema (damage to the vessels that connect to the lymph nodes) What Are the Symptoms? See your doctor if you notice any of the following signs, which could be caused by small intestine cancer or something else: Pain or cramps in the middle of your stomach Losing weight for no known reason A lump in your abdomen Blood in your stool What Tests Can Show Whether I Have It? Your doctor will do a thorough medical exam. They’ll ask about your medical history and any problems you may be having. They’ll likely order imaging tests. These create pictures of your small bowel so they can see if there’s cancer and whether it has spread. Tests might include X-rays, a CT scan , or MRI . They might also order an endoscopy . That’s a procedure where your doctor looks at the inside of your esophagus , stomach, and first part of your small intestine. To do this, they’ll use an endoscope -- a thin, tubelike instrument that has a light and camera at the end of it. You’ll be given medication to sedate you for the procedure. Other tests your doctor might order include the following: Blood chemistry tests . These measure the amount of certain substances your body is making. Liver function tests . Your doctor checks your blood to measure substances released by your liver (and how much). Fecal occult blood test . This detects blood in your stool. Lymph node biopsy . Your doctor removes a piece of your lymph node to check for cancer cells. Laparotomy . This is major surgery. A doctor cuts into the wall of your abdomen to look for signs of disease. What Treatments Are Available? Which treatment your doctor recommends will depend on a number of things, like what type of cancer it is and whether it has spread. Surgery is the most common treatment. Your surgeon may remove the part of the small intestine that contains cancer. Or they may do “bypass” surgery so that food can go around a tumor that can’t be removed. Even if your doctor takes out all of the cancer during surgery, they may still suggest radiation therapy . This uses high-energy X-rays to kill cancer cells. They might also offer chemotherapy ( chemo ). These are drugs you take by mouth or through an IV tube. They, too, kill cancer cells or stop them from growing. A number of new therapies are being tested, as well. Talk to your doctor if you’re interested in taking part in one of these clinical trials before, during, or after your treatment."
44,Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma,"What Is Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma? Small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) is a cancer that affects a type of white blood cell called a ""lymphocyte,"" which helps your body fight infection. You may hear your doctor refer to SLL as a ""non- Hodgkin's lymphoma ,"" which is a group of cancers that affect lymphocytes. When you have SLL, too many ineffective lymphocytes live and multiply in your lymph nodes. These are pea-sized organs in your neck, groin, armpits, and elsewhere, that are part of your immune system. SLL tends to grow slowly. You may not have any symptoms when you're first diagnosed. A lot of people find out they have SLL when it's detected after a blood test for another reason. If you're not having symptoms, you may not need treatment right away. Instead, your doctor will watch your health regularly and won't suggest therapy until you need it. For some people, treatment knocks out the cancer for good, or keeps it from coming back for a long time. It's normal to have worries and questions about any serious condition. Learn about your treatment options, and seek out family and friends for support. They can help you get through the emotional and physical challenges ahead. Causes You can't ""catch"" SLL like you do a cold or infection. It's also not passed on from parents to children. Doctors don't know exactly what causes it. They do know, though, that the disease is rare in people under 50. The average age that people get diagnosed with the disease is 65. And it affects men more than women. A few things are linked to a higher risk of getting SLL: You have a condition that causes you to have a weak immune system, like HIV /AIDS. You've had chemotherapy . You live or work in a farming community. That's possibly because of exposure to pesticides and herbicides. Symptoms You might not have any obvious symptoms when you're diagnosed with SLL. The disease might be found during a routine blood test. About one-third of all people with SLL live for years without having symptoms. When symptoms appear, they may include: Painless swelling in the neck, armpit , or groin Loss of appetite Fatigue Night sweats Fever Weight loss Getting a Diagnosis Your doctor will do a physical exam and may ask you questions such as: Have you ever noticed any swelling in your neck, armpit, or groin? Are you often tired? Is your appetite down lately? Have you lost any weight recently? Your doctor may also ask you to get a lymph node biopsy. This is the main test to diagnose SLL. Your doctor removes the lymph node and checks it under a microscope for signs of cancer . Many lymph nodes are near the surface of your skin . If that's the case, your doctor will give you a shot that numbs your skin. Then they'll make a cut and remove the lymph node. You can usually go home the same day. You'll have a small wound with a few stitches that can be removed in about a week. Your doctor may also do two bone marrow tests -- a bone marrow aspiration and a biopsy -- to find out how advanced your cancer is. They are usually done together as part of a single procedure that removes marrow from the back of your hip bone. For a bone marrow aspiration, your doctor first numbs the skin over your hip and the surface of the bone. They then insert a thin needle into the bone and use a syringe to suck out a small amount of liquid bone marrow. Usually the doctor does the bone marrow biopsy next. They remove a small piece of bone and marrow with a slightly larger needle. Questions for Your Doctor What stage is my cancer? Do I need treatment right now? What are my treatment options? Are there side effects to the treatments? How will my daily life be affected? What kind of follow-up care and monitoring will I need? Treatment If you have no symptoms, your doctor might recommend ""watchful waiting."" During this period, they'll monitor you and start treatment if the disease starts to get worse. If you need treatment, you have several options: Chemotherapy . You can get various chemotherapy drugs that kill your cancer cells. The medicine comes in pill form or may be given through an IV. You may be treated with one drug or a combination. Chemotherapy is a key treatment for SLL and can often put the disease in remission, which means you no longer have any signs of cancer, although it can return. Monoclonal antibody therapy. These are drugs that act like man-made antibodies that specifically target cancer cells. They help your immune system destroy them. Among those available are: Alemtuzumab ( Campath ) Ibritumomab tiuxetan ( Zevalin ) - this is a monoclonal antibody drug that is attached to a radioactive molecule to bring radiation to the cancer cells. Obinutuzumab ( Gazyva ) Polatuzumab vedotin ( Polivy ) Ofatumumab ( Arzerra ) Rituximab ( Rituxan , Rituxan Hycela ) Tafasitamab ( Monjuvi ) You get them through an IV. Radiation therapy . This uses high energy X-rays to kill cancer cells in one or two groups of lymph nodes in the same part of the body. It may be useful if you're in the earlier stages of SLL and the disease hasn't spread. Targeted therapy . These drugs attack one or more specific targets on cancer cells. Your doctor might suggest them if you've already had another treatment that didn't work. Examples taken orally include: Acalabrutinib ( Calquence ) Ibrutinib ( Imbruvica ) Duvelisib ( Copiktra ) Idelalisib ( Zydelig ) Selinexor (Xpovio ) Tazemetostat ( Tazverik ) Zanubrutinib ( Brukinsa ) Those taken by IV include: Belinostat ( Beleodaq ) Bortezomib ( Velcade ) Copanlisib ( Aliqopa ) Romidepsin ​​​​​​​ ( Istodax ) Scientists also are looking for new ways to treat SLL in clinical trials . These test new drugs to see if they are safe and if they work. They often are a way for people to try new medicine that isn't available to everyone. Your doctor can tell you if one of these trials might be a good fit for you. Besides new drugs, another treatment that may be part of a clinical trial is a stem cell transplant. Stem cells are in the news a lot, but usually when you hear about them they're referring to ""embryo"" stem cells that are used in cloning . The stem cells in a transplant are different. They live in your bone marrow and help make new blood cells. This procedure may use your own stem cells or stem cells from a donor. If a donor supplies them, you'll need to find one who is the right match for you, so your body doesn't reject the new stem cells, or start fighting them the way it would fight an infection. Close relatives, such as your brother or sister, are the best chance for a good match. If that doesn't work out, you need to get on a list of potential donors from strangers. Sometimes the best chance for the right stem cells for you will be from someone who's the same race or ethnicity as you. Before the transplant, you'll most likely need to get treated with high doses of chemo for about a week or two. Sometimes radiation therapy is also used. This can be a tough process, because you may get side effects like nausea and mouth sores. Certain medications can make these side effects less severe. When the high-dose chemo is done, you'll start the transplant. You get the new stem cells through an IV. You won't feel any pain from this, and you're awake while it’s happening. After your transplant, it could take 2 to 6 weeks for the stem cells to multiply and start making new blood cells. During this time you may be in the hospital, or at the very least, will need to make visits every day to get checked by your transplant team. It can take 6 months to a year until the number of normal blood cells in your body gets back to what it should be. Taking Care of Yourself Try your best to avoid infections. Eat a healthy diet, get proper rest, and stay away from sick people. Ask your doctor about which vaccinations you should receive, such as shots to prevent flu and pneumonia. Living with a serious illness poses many challenges, both physically and emotionally. For strength and support, surround yourself with those who care about you. They can offer comfort, as well as practical support. You may also find it helpful to talk to a professional counselor, spiritual leader, or a support group. What to Expect SLL tends to be a slow-growing cancer. In time, though, SLL can turn into a more aggressive type of lymphoma . After initial treatment for SLL, many people have a period of remission, when there are no signs of active disease. The illness may not return. But for some people, SLL does come back. If the lymphoma returns, doctors can treat you again. Treatment for disease that returns can be successful, and you may have another period of remission. This keeps your lymphoma under control for many years. Getting Support For more information on SLL and to find out how to join support groups, visit the web site of the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society ."
45,"Smallpox: Symptoms, Spread, and Treatment","What Is Smallpox? Smallpox is a serious infectious disease caused by a virus that’s no longer found in nature. It was passed from person to person. People with smallpox had flu-like symptoms and a rash that would spread across their bodies. Smallpox was deadly. About 30% of people who got smallpox died. In the 1900s, before smallpox was eradicated in 1980, it killed about 300-500 million people around the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) called smallpox “one of the most devastating diseases known to humanity.” If a smallpox vaccination is successful, a scar will form where you received the shot. (Photo Credit: Moment RF/Getty Images) Smallpox history Historians believe that smallpox has been around for at least 3,000 years. This is based on smallpox-like rashes found on Egyptian mummies from the 18th and 20th Egyptian dynasties. Historians say that the growth of civilization and exploration, as well as expanding trade routes, caused the disease to spread to other countries and continents. People began to notice that those who got smallpox and survived never got it again. They realized that the best way to prevent getting sick was to expose yourself to the virus. This was often done by inhaling or rubbing the material from a smallpox sore onto the skin. Eventually, English doctor Edward Jenner learned that exposing people to the similar but less deadly cowpox virus helped protect them from smallpox. Sometime in the 1800s, the smallpox vaccine was modified to use a poxvirus that was similar to smallpox but less harmful. However, the disease continued to infect people around the world. The last smallpox outbreak in the U.S. happened in 1949. In 1967, WHO launched a plan to wipe out smallpox around the world through widespread immunization and surveillance. As a result, no cases of smallpox have happened since 1977. WHO declared it eradicated in 1980. Today, scientists keep only a small amount of the virus alive under tightly controlled conditions in the U.S. and Russia for medical research. Routine smallpox vaccinations stopped in the U.S. and in many other countries in 1972, and in all other WHO member countries by 1986. Many adults living today likely got the vaccine as children. Smallpox Symptoms Smallpox gets its name from the most common sign of the disease: small skin-colored blisters that pop up on the face, arms, and body, and fill up with pus. Other symptoms include: Flu -like fatigue Headache Body aches Intense back pain Some vomiting High fever Mouth sores and blisters that spread the virus into the throat A skin rash that gets worse Blindness that can happen when blisters form near the eyes Smallpox incubation period Usually, you won’t show symptoms of smallpox for about 10-12 days after you've been exposed to someone infected with the virus. But the incubation period (the number of days it takes for symptoms to appear after you’re infected with the virus) can be as little as 7 days or as long as 17 days. The virus enters the body through the membranes in your mouth, nose, or eyes. After about 3-4 days, it travels to your lymph nodes and into your bloodstream where it multiplies. During this time, you won’t show symptoms. About 8 days after exposure, the virus begins to spread to the small blood vessels of the skin and back to the membranes of the mouth. At this point, you may begin to feel like you’re getting sick but not show symptoms. Early smallpox symptoms The earliest symptoms happen about 12 days after exposure. You may get a high fever, feel extremely weak, vomit, and have body aches. About 2 days after that, the virus begins to spread to the outer layer of your skin. Once you get a fever, you become contagious and can spread the disease to other people. Around 12-14 days after exposure, you’ll develop a flat red rash that begins in the membranes of the mouth and throat and on your face and hands. It then spreads to the rest of the body, usually within 24 hours. The rash develops blisters within a day or two. Once the rash appears, your fever will probably drop, and you’ll begin feeling better. What does smallpox look like? Smallpox blisters usually cover a person’s entire body from head to toe, including the mouth and throat. Here is how the rash changes throughout the illness: The rash starts with flat red sores in the mouth and quickly spreads across the body within about 24 hours. The rash turns into raised bumps filled with clear liquid. The bumps turn into pus-filled blisters a day or two later. The blisters crust over, usually about a week later. Scabs form over the blisters and then fall off over the next 3-4 weeks. They can cause permanent scars. Smallpox vs. chickenpox Smallpox and chickenpox are both caused by viruses. Both cause blisters to form on the skin. But there are distinct differences: Smallpox and chickenpox are caused by different viruses. The variola virus causes smallpox, while the varicella virus causes chickenpox. Chickenpox is usually mild, while smallpox was more serious, killing about 30% of the people it infected. Chickenpox sores usually show up first on the trunk of the body or the face. Sores are rarely seen on the palms or soles of the feet. Smallpox sores usually appear first in the mouth, throat, face, or forearms before spreading over most of the body. Most people with smallpox have sores on their palms or the soles of their feet. Smallpox Causes The variola virus causes smallpox. There are two forms of the virus. The more dangerous form, variola major, led to a form of smallpox that killed about 30% of people who were infected. Variola minor caused a less deadly type that killed about 1% of those who got it. Two forms of smallpox -- hemorrhagic and malignant -- were more deadly than the common strain. Hemorrhagic smallpox tended to affect adults, including pregnant adults, not children. Those infected with this strain had more serious symptoms, including fever, pain , and headaches, and they leaked blood from their blisters and mucous membranes. People usually died of blood poisoning within a week. Malignant smallpox tended to affect children. Instead of raised blisters, infected individuals developed flat lesions that emerged on the skin surface. Most people who got this form of smallpox also died of blood poisoning. How Smallpox Is Spread Smallpox is spread from person to person. But you're only contagious once you develop a fever. After that, you are most contagious in the first 7-10 days. This is because the virus is most numerous in your saliva. Once scabs form on your blisters, you can still spread the disease but you're less contagious. You're considered noncontagious when the last scab falls off. The disease enters your body through the mucous membranes in your mouth, nose, or eyes. You could get it: By breathing in the virus during close, face-to-face contact with an infected person. It usually spreads through drops of saliva when the person coughs , sneezes, or speaks. By handling the clothes or sheets of an infected person or coming into contact with their body fluids. Very rarely, smallpox has spread among people in small, enclosed spaces, probably through air in the ventilation system. Animals and insects don’t spread the disease. If the virus were spread through an act of terrorism. This is a rare possibility, but in case it happens, governments around the world have stockpiled smallpox vaccines to prevent the spread . Smallpox Diagnosis Because smallpox hasn’t been diagnosed in decades, it’s likely that doctors wouldn’t recognize the disease in a patient right away. It’s possible to diagnose the condition by testing a sample of tissue taken from a smallpox blister. A single diagnosis would be considered a worldwide health emergency. Smallpox Treatment In the event a case does emerge, there are two antiviral drugs approved by the U.S. FDA to treat the disease: tecovirimat (TPOXX) and brincidofovir (Tembexa). Both have been shown to stop the growth of the virus that causes smallpox. The drug cidofovir has been shown to stop the growth of the smallpox virus. It’s not FDA-approved to treat smallpox, but it could be used during an outbreak under certain circumstances, such as an Emergency Use Authorization. None of these drugs have been tested in people sick with smallpox. But tecovirimat and cidofovir have been shown to work in animals with diseases similar to smallpox, and it’s believed that brincidofovir would, too. Tecovirimat and cidofovir are stockpiled within the U.S. Strategic National Stockpile, which holds medications and medical supplies to protect the American public in the event of a public health emergency, such as a smallpox outbreak. Getting the vaccine within 3-4 days of contact with the virus may make the disease less severe or may help prevent it. Beyond that, medical care aims to ease symptoms (such as fever and body aches) and control any other illnesses that a person can get when their immune system is weak. Antibiotics can help if someone gets a bacterial infection while they have smallpox. Smallpox Complications If people get hemorrhagic or malignant smallpox, they are more likely to die. The more fatal forms of the disease are more likely to affect those who are pregnant or immunocompromised. People who survive smallpox may have scarring on their face and body. In rare cases, they may become blind. Smallpox can also cause infertility in men and those assigned male at birth (AMAB), and it may cause miscarriage or stillbirths in those who are pregnant. Smallpox Vaccine Scientists use the vaccinia virus, which is the cousin virus to variola, to make the smallpox vaccine, because it poses fewer health risks. The vaccine helps the body's immune system to make antibodies, which recognize and protect against the variola virus and help prevent smallpox disease. Routine smallpox vaccinations stopped in 1972 in countries where cases were no longer reported, including the U.S. Other WHO member countries stopped routine smallpox vaccinations in 1986. No one knows for sure how long the smallpox vaccine protects people from the disease. Some experts believe it lasts up to 5 years and wears off over time. Since it may not give lifelong protection, anyone vaccinated years ago as a child could be at risk of future infection by the variola virus. The only people known to be immune for life are those who have had smallpox and survived. WHO and its member countries keep an emergency stockpile of the smallpox vaccine. It’s rarely used today, except for those few people who are around the variola virus, such as laboratory researchers working with variola or similar viruses. Who invented the smallpox vaccine? English doctor Edward Jenner developed the first successful smallpox in 1796. He had noticed that milkmaids who had gotten sick with cowpox seemed immune to smallpox. He assumed that exposure to the cowpox virus must help protect against smallpox. He tested the theory on the 9-year-old son of his gardener, later exposing the boy to smallpox, but the boy never got sick. Jenner’s smallpox vaccine became commonly widely accepted. At some point in the 1800s, the cowpox virus in the vaccine was replaced with the vaccinia virus. Smallpox vaccine scar Many people (mostly in their 40s or older) who got the smallpox vaccine have a permanent scar on their arm where they got the injection. This scar isn’t from the needle but rather from the body’s immune reaction to defend itself against the controlled infection caused by the live vaccinia virus in the vaccine. Exposure to the virus usually left a sore and itchy bump at the injection site. The bump turned into a larger blister that eventually fell off and left a scar. The formation of a sore bump — and ultimately, a scar — at the injection site lets you know that the immunization process was successful. Smallpox vaccine risks Smallpox vaccine side effects are generally mild, such as: Soreness in the arm that received the injection Itching Swollen lymph nodes Fever Headache Body aches Mild rash Fatigue Some side effects can be dangerous, especially for people with weakened immune systems. They can range from skin reactions to a serious nervous system condition called encephalitis , which can lead to convulsions, coma , and death. But these side effects are very rare. Based on historical data, for every 1 million people vaccinated for smallpox, only one to two people died from a bad reaction. People who would have a higher risk of a reaction to the vaccine include: Those who are pregnant or breastfeeding People with skin disorders such as eczema People with a weak immune system due to a medical condition such as leukemia or HIV People on medical treatments, such as for cancer , that make the immune system weak People who have had a serious allergic reaction to a previous smallpox vaccine Smallpox as a Public Health Threat It’s hard to know how major a threat a smallpox outbreak would be today. Scientists can’t be sure because: The number of people around the world with weakened immune systems is higher today than when smallpox existed. Countries used vaccines of different strengths during the global effort to end smallpox. There’s no way to know for sure how long these different vaccinations give immunity to the virus. If an outbreak of smallpox were to happen today, public health measures would likely include these steps: Finding and vaccinating infected people Vaccinating health care workers and others at risk of infection Isolating smallpox patients to keep them from spreading the disease Providing vaccinations for the public, as needed, to contain the outbreak Takeaways Smallpox was eradicated in 1980, and no cases have happened since 1977. Scientists keep a small amount of the smallpox virus alive under tightly controlled conditions in the U.S. and Russia for medical research. In the event of another smallpox outbreak, governments around the world have smallpox treatments and vaccines stockpiled to protect the public. Smallpox FAQs Does smallpox still exist? Smallpox has been eliminated worldwide. But researchers keep a small amount of the live virus in tightly controlled conditions for research purposes. Is monkeypox the same as smallpox? Mpox is caused by the monkeypox virus, which is part of the same family of viruses as the smallpox virus. The symptoms of mpox are similar to but milder than smallpox and the disease is nowhere near as deadly. Neither mpox nor smallpox are related to chickenpox. Why was smallpox so fatal? Smallpox was so deadly because there were no reliable treatments available. And while the first vaccine was developed in 1796 and was widely accepted, it was not widely administered. Smallpox killed as many as 300-500 million people in the 1900s. Thanks to global immunization efforts, the disease was wiped out by 1980."
46,Snoring,"What Is Snoring? Snoring is noisy breathing while you sleep. It’s a common condition that can affect anyone, although it happens more often in men and in people who are overweight . Snoring tends to get worse with age. Snoring once in a while isn’t usually a serious problem. It’s mostly a nuisance for your bed partner. But if you’re a long-term snorer, you not only disrupt the sleep patterns of those close to you, you hurt your own sleep quality. Snoring can itself be a symptom of a health problem like obstructive sleep apnea . Talk to your doctor if you’re overly sleepy during the day, if you snore often or very loudly, or if your partner notices that you sometimes stop breathing altogether. You might need medical help so you (and your loved ones) can get a good night’s sleep . Snoring Causes Snoring happens when the flow of air through your mouth and nose is blocked. Several things can interfere with air flow, including: Blocked nasal airways. Some people snore only during allergy season or when they have a sinus infection . Problems in your nose such as a deviated septum (when the wall that separates one nostril from the other is off-center) or nasal polyps can also block your airways. Poor muscle tone in your throat and tongue . Throat and tongue muscles can be too relaxed, which allows them to collapse into your airway. Bulky throat tissue. Being overweight can cause this. Some children have large tonsils and adenoids that make them snore. Long soft palate and/or uvula. A long soft palate or a long uvula (the dangling tissue in the back of your mouth) can narrow the opening from your nose to your throat. When you breathe, this causes them to vibrate and bump against one another, and your airway becomes blocked. Alcohol and drug use. Drinking alcohol or taking muscle relaxers can also make your tongue and throat muscles relax too much. Sleep position. Sleeping on your back can make you snore. So can using a pillow that’s too soft or too large. Sleep deprivation . Your throat muscles might relax too much if you’re not getting enough sleep. Snoring Diagnosis and Treatment Your partner might be the person who tells you that you snore. Your doctor will ask both of you about your symptoms. Your doctor will also ask about your medical history and do a physical exam to look for things that could block your airways, like chronic nasal congestion due to rhinitis or sinusitis , a deviated septum, or swollen tonsils. They might also give you some tests: Imaging tests . An X-ray, MRI scan, or CT scan can look for problems in your airways. Sleep study . You might need to have a machine monitor your sleep while you’re at home or spend the night in a lab for a test called polysomnography. It will measure things like your heart rate , breathing, and brain activity while you sleep. Treatments for snoring include: Lifestyle changes. Your doctor might tell you to lose weight , quit smoking , or stop drinking alcohol before bed. Oral appliances. You wear a small plastic device in your mouth while you sleep. It keeps your airways open by moving your jaw or tongue. Surgery. Several kinds of procedures can help stop snoring. Your doctor might remove or shrink tissues in your throat, or make your soft palate stiffer. CPAP . A continuous positive airway pressure machine treats sleep apnea and might reduce snoring by blowing air into your airways while you sleep. Home Remedies to Stop Snoring Try these other solutions to get a good night’s sleep. Sleep on your side, not your back. Raise the head of your bed a few inches. Use nasal strips that stick to the bridge of your nose to widen your nostrils. Stick to a sleep schedule. Snoring Complications Snoring doesn’t seem to have complications. But sleep apnea can cause problems, including: Frequent waking from sleep, even though you may not realize it Light sleeping. Waking up so many times a night interferes with your normal pattern of sleep, causing you to spend more time in light sleep than in more restorative, deeper sleep. Strain on your heart . Long-term obstructive sleep apnea often raises blood pressure and may make your heart get bigger, with higher risks of heart attack and stroke . Poor night's sleep. This makes you sleepy during the day, can interfere with your quality of life, and can make car accidents more likely."
47,What Is Social Anxiety Disorder or Social Phobia?,"We all know the feeling of being nervous or uncomfortable in a social situation. Maybe you’ve clammed up when meeting someone new or gotten sweaty palms before making a big presentation. Public speaking or walking into a roomful of strangers isn’t exactly thrilling for everybody, but most people can get through it. If you have social anxiety disorder, which is also known as social phobia, the stress of these situations is too much to handle. You might, for example, avoid all social contact because things that other people consider “normal” -- like making small talk and eye contact -- make you so uncomfortable. All aspects of your life, not just the social, could start to fall apart. Social anxiety disorder affects about 5.3 million people in the United States. The average age it begins is between age 11 and 19 -- the teenage years. It’s one of the most common mental disorders, so if you have it, there’s hope. The tough part is being able to ask for help. Here’s how to know if your social silence has gone beyond shyness to a point where you need to see a doctor. When Does It Happen? In some people with social anxiety disorder, the fear is limited to one or two particular situations, like speaking in public or initiating a conversation. Others are very anxious and afraid of any social situation. Anyone with social anxiety disorder can experience it in different ways. But here are some common situations that people tend to have trouble with: Talking to strangers Speaking in public Dating Making eye contact Entering rooms Using public restrooms Going to parties Eating in front of other people Going to school or work Starting conversations Some of these situations might not cause a problem for you. For example, giving a speech may be easy, but going to a party might be a nightmare. Or you could be great at one-on-one conversations but not at stepping into a crowded classroom. All socially anxious people have different reasons for dreading certain situations. But in general, it’s an overwhelming fear of: Being judged or watched by others in social situations Being embarrassed or humiliated -- and showing it by blushing, sweating , or shaking Accidentally offending someone Being the center of attention What Does It Feel Like? Again, the experience may be different for everyone, but if you have social anxiety and you’re in a stressful situation, you may feel: Very self-conscious in social situations A persistent, intense, and chronic fear of being judged by others Shy and uncomfortable when being watched (giving a presentation, talking in a group) Hesitant to talk to others The need to avoid eye contact You also might have physical symptoms such as: Rapid heartbeat Muscle tension Dizziness and lightheadedness Blushing Crying Sweating Stomach trouble and diarrhea Inability to catch breath An “out-of-body” sensation You may start having symptoms and getting anxious immediately before an event, or you might spend weeks worrying about it. Afterward, you could spend a lot of time and mental energy worrying about how you acted. What Causes It? There’s no one thing that causes social anxiety disorder. Genetics likely has something to do with it: If you have a family member with social phobia, you’re more at risk of having it, too. It could also be linked to having an overactive amygdala -- the part of the brain that controls your fear response. Social anxiety disorder usually comes on around 13 years of age. It can be linked to a history of abuse, bullying , or teasing. Shy kids are also more likely to become socially anxious adults, as are children with overbearing or controlling parents. If you develop a health condition that draws attention to your appearance or voice, that could trigger social anxiety, too. How Can It Affect Your Life? Social anxiety disorder prevents you from living your life. You’ll avoid situations that most people consider “normal.” You might even have a hard time understanding how others can handle them so easily. When you avoid all or most social situations, it affects your personal relationships. It can also lead to: Low self-esteem Negative thoughts Depression Sensitivity to criticism Poor social skills that don’t improve What Can I Do About Social Anxiety Disorder? If your social anxiety keeps you from doing things you want or need to do, or from making or keeping friends, you may need treatment. Talk about your fears and worries with a doctor or therapist who has experience treating social anxiety disorder. They will be able to tell if you have normal social anxiety or if you need treatment. How Is Social Anxiety Disorder Treated? Prescription medication and behavioral therapy are the two effective treatments for social anxiety disorder. You may receive both at the same time. Here are some details on each: Medications: For some, taking a prescription medication can be an easy and effective treatment for social anxiety disorder. The drugs work by reducing the uncomfortable and often embarrassing symptoms. Sometimes medication can dramatically reduce your symptoms or even eliminate them. Some people may not react to a particular medication, and some aren't helped at all. There is no way to predict whether a medication will help you or not. Sometimes, you must try several before finding one that works. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved four medicines for social anxiety disorder: Paxil, Zoloft, Luvox, and Effexor. Although these are the only medications approved specifically for the condition, other medications may be used successfully, too. The advantage of medications is that they can be very effective, and are taken just once a day. But there are some downsides. First, medication only treats symptoms. If you stop taking it, your symptoms can return. Second, some people have side effects from anxiety medications. They may include headache, stomachache, nausea , and sleep difficulties. Also, the FDA-approved medicines for social anxiety disorder, like all medicines that are also used to treat depression, carry a warning from the FDA. The FDA says the medications may cause or worsen suicidal thoughts or behaviors in young people under age 24. Therefore, teens who take these medicines should be monitored closely for changes in thoughts about suicide . For many people, the advantages of medications outweigh the disadvantages. You and your doctor must weigh the choice. If you take medication for social anxiety disorder, call your doctor immediately if you develop any side effects, including feeling down and depressed. And never stop taking any anxiety medication without talking to your doctor first. Suddenly stopping an anxiety medication may cause serious side effects. Behavioral therapy: Behavioral therapy with a trained therapist can help you identify and change the thinking that makes you anxious in social situations. A type of behavioral therapy called exposure therapy is frequently used for social anxiety disorder. Exposure therapy works by gradually exposing you to social situations that are uncomfortable and waiting until you feel comfortable. During this process, your brain is learning that a social situation you were afraid of is actually not so bad. Most therapists who practice exposure therapy begin with small exposures to uncomfortable situations, then move on to more difficult exposures once you feel comfortable. The advantage of this therapy is that you are treating the underlying problem, not just the symptoms of social anxiety disorder. So if you stop behavioral therapy, the chance of your symptoms returning is less likely. Other therapies Other therapies have also been tried for treating social anxiety disorder. They include: Relaxation therapy: With this therapeutic approach, you learn techniques for relaxing like breathing exercises and meditation. Although relaxation therapy may help with some specific social phobias, it is not considered effective treatment for general anxiety disorder. Beta-blockers : These medications were originally used to treat high blood pressure or other heart problems. Yet beta-blockers are also effective for treating some people with a specific type of social phobia called ""performance social anxiety."" This is when you are afraid of performing, like giving a public speech. Beta-blockers are not effective for treating general social anxiety disorder. But they may help if fear of a specific circumstance, occurring at a specific, predictable time -- like giving a speech to a class -- is your problem. When Should I Talk to My Doctor About Social Anxiety? First, it's important to know that you are not abnormal if you have social anxiety . Many people have it. If you have unusually high anxiety and fear about social situations, talk openly with your doctor about treatment. If left untreated, social anxiety disorder may lead to depression, drug or alcohol problems, school or work problems, and a poor quality of life."
48,Sarcoma,"A sarcoma is a rare kind of cancer . Sarcomas are different from the much more common carcinomas because they happen in a different kind of tissue. Sarcomas grow in connective tissue -- cells that connect or support other kinds of tissue in your body. These tumors are most common in the bones, muscles, tendons, cartilage, nerves, fat, and blood vessels of your arms and legs, but they can also happen in other areas of your body.. Although there are more than 50 types of sarcoma, they can be grouped into two main kinds: soft tissue sarcoma and bone sarcoma, or osteosarcoma . About 13,190 cases of soft tissue sarcoma and 800-900 new cases of bone sarcomas will be diagnosed in the U.S. in 2022. Sarcomas can be treated, often by having surgery to remove the tumor. Sarcoma Risk Factors We don't yet know what causes sarcoma, but we do know some things that raise the risk of developing one: Other people in your family have had sarcoma You have a bone disorder called Paget's disease You have a genetic disorder such as neurofibromatosis , Gardner syndrome, retinoblastoma , or Li-Fraumeni syndrome You're been exposed to radiation , perhaps during treatment for an earlier cancer Sarcoma Symptoms Soft tissue sarcomas are hard to spot, because they can grow anywhere in your body. Most often, the first sign is a painless lump. As the lump gets bigger, it might press against nerves or muscles and make you uncomfortable or give you trouble breathing , or both. There are no tests that can find these tumors before they cause symptoms that you notice. Osteosarcoma can show obvious early symptoms, including: Pain off and on in the affected bone, which may be worse at night Swelling, which often starts weeks after the pain A limp, if the sarcoma is in your leg Children and young adults get osteosarcoma more often than adults. And because healthy, active children and teens often have pain and swelling in their arms and legs, osteosarcoma might be mistaken for growing pains or a sports injury. If your child's pain doesn't get better, gets worse at night, and is in one arm or leg rather than both, talk to a doctor. Adults who have this kind of pain should see a doctor right away. Diagnosing Sarcoma If your doctor thinks you may have a sarcoma, you'll probably need a full exam and tests, including: A sample of cells from the tumor, called a biopsy Imaging tests, such as a CT scan, an ultrasound , or an MRI, to help see inside your body A bone scan, if you might have osteosarcoma Sarcoma Treatments How your sarcoma is treated depends on what type you have, where in your body it is, how developed it is, and whether or not it has spread to other parts of your body, or metastasized. Surgery takes the tumor out of your body. In most cases of osteosarcoma, the doctor can remove just the cancer cells, and you won't need your arm or leg removed, too. Radiation can shrink the tumor before surgery or kill cancer cells that are left after surgery. It could be the main treatment, if surgery isn't an option. Chemotherapy drugs can also be used with or instead of surgery. Chemo is often the first treatment when the cancer has spread. Targeted therapies are newer treatments that use drugs or manmade versions of antibodies from the immune system to block the growth of cancer cells while leaving normal cells undamaged. Surviving Sarcoma Most people diagnosed with a soft tissue sarcoma are cured by surgery alone, if the tumor is low-grade; that means it is not likely to spread to other parts of the body. More aggressive sarcomas are harder to treat successfully. The survival rate for osteosarcoma is between 60% and 75% if the cancer has not spread outside the area it started. It is more likely to be cured if all of the cancer can be removed by surgery."
49,What Is Torticollis?,"Torticollis is a condition of the neck muscles that causes the head to tilt down. The term comes from two Latin words: tortus, which means twisted, and collum, which means neck . Sometimes it’s called “wryneck” or “loxia.” If your baby has the condition at birth, it’s called congenital muscular torticollis. That’s the most common type. Congenital forms of torticollis are usually painless. Babies can also develop infant torticollis after birth. Then it’s called “acquired,” rather than congenital. Acquired torticollis may be linked to other, more serious medical issues, and it could be quite painful. Adults can also develop wryneck after a head or neck injury. Or, the condition might occur as a side effect of certain medications. If your baby has acquired torticollis, there are stretching exercises that may help. (Photo credit: Eric Olson/WebMD) Torticollis Causes You have a long muscle on each side of your neck that runs from the back of your ear to your collarbone. It is called the sternocleidomastoid, or SCM. When your baby has torticollis, this ropy muscle is shortened on one side. Why does the muscle become shortened? Your baby might have been cramped in the womb or may have been in an abnormal position, such as a breech position. That can put extra pressure on one side of your infant ’s head, which can cause the SCM to tighten. If your doctor used forceps or a vacuum device during delivery, those also might have put pressure on your baby’s SCM. Torticollis causes in infants Your baby’s womb position and the tools used during their delivery aren’t the only reasons behind congenital torticollis. Other possible causes include: An abnormal development in the SCM Klippel-Feil syndrome (a rare birth defect that causes the vertebrae in your baby’s neck to fuse) Hematoma (a buildup of blood in your baby’s neck muscles) Fibrosis (thickening of your baby’s muscle tissue) Some possible causes of acquired torticollis are: Swelling in your child’s throat, which could be triggered by an infection, injury, or unknown cause Vision problems Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD: a condition where stomach acid irritates the lining of the tube that connects your mouth and stomach) A reaction to certain medicines Scar tissue Arthritis in the neck Sandifer syndrome (a movement disorder that causes muscle spasms due to acid reflux) Grisel’s syndrome (a rare side effect of surgeries that involve the head, neck, ear, nose, or throat) Many times, wryneck occurs without any known cause. Doctors call this idiopathic torticollis. Torticollis causes in adults A type of torticollis, called cervical dystonia or spasmodic torticollis, typically affects adults. This form causes a person’s neck muscles to spasm. Some possible causes of cervical dystonia are: A head or neck injury A reaction to medications used to treat depression or other mental health conditions An inherited genetic mutation Torticollis Symptoms Torticollis symptoms in infants You may not notice anything unusual about your baby for the first 6 or 8 weeks. It’s common for torticollis symptoms to become obvious once an infant gains more control of the head and neck. Some of the symptoms you might see: Your child’s head tilts to one side with their chin pointed to the opposite shoulder . In about 75% of babies with torticollis, the right side is affected. Their head doesn’t turn side to side or up and down easily. You feel a soft lump in your baby’s neck muscle. This isn’t dangerous and usually goes away within 6 months. Your baby prefers to look over the shoulder at you. Their eyes don’t follow you because that would require turning their head. Your baby has trouble breastfeeding on one side or prefers to feed on one side only. Your baby works hard to turn toward you, struggles to turn their head all the way, and becomes upset because the movement is hard. They might start getting a flat head on one or both sides, from lying in one position all the time. This is called “positional plagiocephaly.” One of your baby’s shoulders is higher than the other. Your baby has muscle tightness or stiffness. Your baby has swollen neck muscles. You notice that your baby has uneven facial features. For example, one eye might appear lower than the other. Symptoms of acquired torticollis may include: Your child has severe neck pain or headaches. Their head tilts to one side, while their chin tilts to the other. Your child’s neck muscles are tight, stiff, or swollen. You notice that your child has limited movement in their head and neck. One of your child’s shoulders is higher than the other. Your child has head tremors (shaking or trembling movements). Torticollis symptoms in adults Some possible signs of torticollis in adults are: Spasms or tremors that cause your muscles to twitch, jerk, or shake Tense neck muscles Pain or burning in your shoulders, neck, or back Headaches Tilting your head forward, backward, or side to side Bending your neck and head forward, backward, or side to side Turning your head Torticollis Diagnosis If you notice signs that look like your baby might have torticollis, set up an exam with your doctor. The doctor will start by checking how far your baby’s head will turn. They also may order imaging scans, such as X-rays, CT scans, MRIs, and ultrasound , to check for other conditions. A special test, called an electromyogram (EMG), can reveal which muscles are most affected. Blood tests are also used to rule out other conditions that are linked to torticollis. About 1 in 5 babies with torticollis will also have a hip problem. Most babies with torticollis don’t have other medical problems. But it is sometimes linked to infections, broken bones, allergic reactions to medicines, or genetic conditions such as Down syndrome or Klippel-Feil syndrome. To diagnose torticollis in adults, doctors will typically perform a physical exam, ask about your family history, and assess your symptoms. Tests, such as MRI and EMG, usually aren’t necessary unless your doctor thinks your spinal cord is compressed or you have nerve damage. It’s important not to ignore symptoms that may be serious. Meningitis, a condition that causes inflammation of the membranes that cover your brain and spinal cord, may look like torticollis. You should get medical help right away if you experience symptoms of meningitis, such as: A sudden, high fever Chills A stiff neck Severe headache Confusion or trouble concentrating A skin rash Torticollis Complications If you act early, you can help prevent any long-term effects of torticollis for your baby. Without treatment, your baby might get complications, including: Less control of their head Limited reach on the affected side and less tracking with the eyes Delays in sitting and walking A problem feeding Poor balance Crooked crawling Rolling onto one side only Facial deformities Flat head syndrome (from lying on the same side too much) Motor skill delays Problems with hearing and vision Torticollis in adults is linked to these complications: Balance problems Changes in the way you walk Bone spurs (bony lumps that develop on the edge of bones) A more serious underlying condition, such as an injury, tumor, or infection A disability that interferes with your everyday life Emotional issues Torticollis Treatment Torticollis treatment in infants If your baby has acquired torticollis, treatment will focus on the condition that’s causing it. Most cases of congenital torticollis can be treated with stretching exercises or position changes that you can perform at home. The doctor may teach you some specific exercises to do with your little one. These moves will help lengthen the tighter, shorter muscle and also strengthen the muscle on the opposite side. Once torticollis is diagnosed and stretching exercises start, most babies improve within 6 months. Two things can speed up recovery: an early diagnosis and sticking to the treatment plan. Here are some other things you can do at home: Use your baby’s appetite as an incentive. Offer the bottle or your breast in a way that gets them to turn away from the favored side. Place toys so that your baby is forced to look both ways. Those with sounds and lights are really good at drawing their attention. Get them to play with their hands and feet. Babies like to bring their hands together and their feet up to their hands. When your baby does this, it builds up muscles they will need to crawl. Give them plenty of time on your tummy. Holding your baby this way will strengthen their back and neck muscles and keep the back of their head from flattening. Ideally, they should have 15 minutes of tummy time four times a day. You can support them on your chest, across your lap, or on a pillow if that makes it easier. In addition to home treatment, your doctor may want your baby to see a physical therapist. Very rarely, children with torticollis will need surgery to lengthen the SCM muscle. Doctors will usually wait until your child is a preschooler to consider this option. Torticollis treatment in adults Treatment for torticollis in adults may depend on the cause. Some possible options include: Physical therapy, which may include heat therapy, massage, and traction devices to relieve pain Stretching exercises Braces or other devices to keep the neck in place Medicines, such as baclofen, to help with muscle spasms Anti-inflammatories to keep pain at bay Botox injections Trigger point injections Spine surgery if the condition is due to a vertebral dislocation Here are some home remedies that may help improve your symptoms: Stretch your neck muscles Apply hot and cold therapy Get enough rest Touch the opposite side of your face, neck, or chin to temporarily stop spasms Reduce stress Torticollis Prevention While there’s no way to prevent torticollis in babies, you can avoid complications if you treat it early and stick to your treatment plan. Adults may be able to lessen their risk of torticollis if they avoid neck injuries and strains. It’s also helpful to practice good posture and perform stretching exercises often. You might not be able to completely prevent torticollis, but prompt treatment can keep the condition from getting worse. Takeaways Torticollis can be present in babies at birth, acquired later in childhood, or even affect adults. It’s usually treated with at-home stretches and positioning. If these therapies aren’t successful for you or your child, let your doctor know. Other options may work better. Torticollis FAQs How serious is torticollis? Torticollis is a relatively common condition that usually responds well to treatment. Rarely, torticollis can be a sign that you have a more serious underlying medical condition, such as a tumor, injury, or infection. Does torticollis go away on its own? Although torticollis can go away on its own, babies often need treatment to stretch their muscles. You should see your doctor for regular checkups to assess your baby’s progress. What causes torticollis in babies? There are lots of possible causes. The way your baby was positioned in the womb before birth is one. Other reasons include a problem with the muscles and nerves in the neck or a birth condition. Should I be worried if my baby has torticollis? You shouldn’t worry if your doctor tells you your baby has torticollis. Most of the time, the condition usually doesn’t cause any pain and shouldn’t pose long-term issues if treated promptly. What triggers torticollis? The way babies are positioned in the womb before birth can trigger congenital torticollis. Swelling in a child’s throat can prompt acquired torticollis. In adults, a head or neck injury can sometimes be the culprit."
50,Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS),"What Is Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)? IBS is a mix of belly discomfort or pain and trouble with bowel habits: either going more or less often than normal ( diarrhea or constipation ) or having a different kind of stool (thin, hard, or soft and liquid). Doctors used to call IBS other names, including: IBS colitis Mucous colitis Spastic colon Nervous colon Spastic bowel IBS isn’t life-threatening, and it doesn't make you more likely to get other colon conditions, such as ulcerative colitis , Crohn's disease , or colon cancer . But it can be a long-lasting problem that changes how you live your life. People with IBS may miss work or school more often, and they may feel less able to take part in daily activities. Some people may need to change their work setting: shifting to working at home, changing hours, or even not working at all. Constipation and diarrhea can be symptoms of IBS. (Photo Credit: iStock/Getty Images) Types of IBS There are four types of irritable bowl syndrome: IBS with constipation (IBS-C) IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D) Mixed IBS (IBS-M), which alternates between constipation and diarrhea Unsubtyped IBS (IBS-U), which is for people who don't fit into the above types IBS Symptoms Irritable bowel syndrome symptoms can include: Diarrhea (often described as violent episodes of diarrhea) Constipation Constipation alternating with diarrhea Belly pains or cramps , usually in the lower half of the belly, that get worse after meals and feel better after a bowel movement A lot of gas or bloating Harder or looser stools than normal (pellets or flat ribbon stools) A belly that sticks out Mucus in your poop Feeling like you still need to poop after you just did Food intolerance Tiredness Anxiety Depression Heartburn and indigestion Headaches Needing to pee a lot Other things may cause these symptoms sometimes. If it’s IBS, you’ll likely have these symptoms weekly for 3 months, or less often for at least 6 months. People assigned female at birth (AFAB) who have IBS may have more symptoms during their period. Some people also have urinary symptoms or sexual problems. Stress can make symptoms worse. When to call your doctor If you have an IBS symptom that lasts a long time, you get a new symptom, your pain is worse than usual, or you have new pain, see your doctor. If you usually take over-the-counter medications but now they don’t ease problems like diarrhea, gas, or cramping, you also need to see a doctor. Even if you don’t think a problem is physically part of IBS, but it bothers you, tell your doctor. For example, if you’re stressed out or anxious about it, or if you’re losing sleep over the problem, let your doctor know. IBS usually doesn’t lead to more serious diseases, but there are “red flags” to look for that could mean something more serious is going on. A red-flag symptom is one that isn’t usually seen with IBS. If you have one or more, see your doctor. You’ll need tests to find out what’s going on. Red-flag symptoms include: Rectal bleeding: It could just be a side effect from your irritable bowel syndrome constipation, caused by a tear in your anus. The bleeding also might be caused by a hemorrhoid. But if you have a large amount of blood in your stool, or if the bleeding just won’t go away, you should get medical attention as soon as possible. Weight loss: If you find you’re losing weight for no reason, it’s time to get it checked out. Fever, vomiting, and anemia: If you have one or more, or think you do, you should call your doctor. Irritable bowel syndrome symptoms in children IBS affects as many as 1 in 6 children, and they share many of the same symptoms of IBS that adults have. Irritable bowel syndrome symptoms in children may include: Belly pain or discomfort that may improve after pooping Diarrhea, constipation, or both Mucus in your poop Urgent need to poop Bloating Cramping Flatulence (farting) Weight loss Nausea and vomiting Feeling like you haven’t finished pooping Children also can have red-flag symptoms that could mean something more concerning than IBS. These symptoms include: Ongoing pain in the upper or lower right side of their belly (abdomen) A hard time swallowing or pain when swallowing Ongoing vomiting Diarrhea at night Bleeding from their rectum, blood in their vomit, or other signs of gastrointestinal bleeding Arthritis Unexplained weight loss Slowed growth Delayed puberty IBS vs. IBD Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are very different conditions that share a few symptoms in common, such as belly discomfort and diarrhea. Both are chronic and have no known cure. But IBD is much more serious. The inflammation that it causes can damage your intestines, and the disease raises your risk of colorectal cancer. IBS, on the other hand, does not harm your gut or increase your chances of cancer or other serious health concerns. What Causes IBS? While several things are known to trigger IBS symptoms , experts don't know what causes the condition. Studies suggest that the colon gets hypersensitive, overreacting to mild stimulation. Instead of slow, rhythmic muscle movements, the bowel muscles spasm. That can cause diarrhea or constipation. Another theory suggests it may involve chemicals made by the body, such as serotonin and gastrin, that control nerve signals between the brain and digestive tract. Other researchers are studying to see if certain bacteria in the bowels can lead to the condition. Risk Factors for Irritable Bowel Syndrome IBS affects between 25 million and 45 million Americans. Some things seem to make people more likely to have it than others: Being assigned female at birth. About twice as many people AFAB as those assigned male at birth (AMAB) have the condition. It’s not clear why, but some researchers think the changing hormones in the menstrual cycle may have something to do with it. So far, studies haven’t borne this out. Age. IBS can affect people of all ages, but it's more likely to happen in people in their teens through their 40s. Family history. The condition seems to run in families. Some studies have shown that your genes may play a role. Emotional trouble. Some people with IBS seem to have trouble with stress , have a mental disorder, or have been through a traumatic event in their lives, such as sexual abuse or domestic violence. It's not clear what comes first – the stress or the IBS. But there's evidence that stress management and behavioral therapy can help relieve symptoms in some people with the condition. Food sensitivities. Some people may have digestive systems that rumble angrily when they eat dairy, wheat, a sugar in fruits called fructose, or the sugar substitute sorbitol. Fatty foods, carbonated drinks, and alcohol can also upset digestion. There's no proof any of these foods cause IBS, but they may trigger symptoms. Medications. Studies have shown a link between IBS symptoms and antibiotics, antidepressants, and drugs made with sorbitol . Other digestive problems, like stomach flu, traveler's diarrhea, or food poisoning . A small study published in January 2021 suggests that a GI tract infection can change the immune system so that it responds to certain foods as if they're a threat, like germs or viruses. Researchers are looking into these early findings. Chronic pain conditions. Several disorders that cause pain have been linked to irritable bowel syndrome, including: Fibromyalgia Chronic pelvic pain Interstitial cystitis, which causes bladder pain Migraine Temporomandibular syndrome, which causes pain when chewing Chronic fatigue syndrome IBS Diagnosis There are no specific lab tests that can diagnose IBS. Your doctor will see if your symptoms match with the definition of IBS, and they may run tests to rule out conditions such as: Food allergies or intolerances, such as lactose intolerance and poor dietary habits Medications such as high blood pressure drugs , iron, and certain antacids Infection Enzyme deficiencies where the pancreas isn't releasing enough enzymes to properly digest or break down food Inflammatory bowel diseases like ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease Your doctor may do some of the following tests to decide if you have IBS: Flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy to look for signs of blockage or inflammation in your intestines Upper endoscopy if you have heartburn or indigestion X-rays Blood tests to look for anemia (too few red blood cells ), thyroid problems , and signs of infection Stool tests for blood or infections Tests for lactose intolerance, gluten allergy , or celiac disease Tests to look for problems with your bowel muscles 10 questions to ask your doctor Going to the doctor can be intimidating. You might feel rushed and forget to ask questions that are important. It's always a good idea to know what to ask beforehand and to take notes during your appointment. Some of the questions below may be worth asking. Print them out to take with you to your next appointment: Could some other condition be causing my IBS symptoms ? Could I have inflammatory bowel disease or colon cancer? Should I keep a diary of my IBS symptoms , and, if so, what should I write down? Should I take laxatives or other over-the-counter medications ? If so, what type, and how often is it safe to take them? Would adding more fiber to my diet help with my IBS symptoms? If so, how much and what kind? Are there other dietary changes you would recommend for IBS, a nd should I consult a dietitian? Could relaxation therapy, counseling, or exercise ease my IBS ? Should I take prescription medications for my IBS symptoms? If so, what side effects should I expect? Are there any tests you would recommend now or in the future? Are there any other approaches or treatments I should know about? How soon should I have a follow-up appointment? IBS Treatment Nearly all people with IBS can get help, but no single treatment works for everyone. You and your doctor will need to work together to find the right treatment plan to manage your symptoms. Many things can trigger IBS symptoms , including certain foods, medicines, the presence of gas or stool, and emotional stress . You’ll need to learn what your triggers are. You may need to make some lifestyle changes and take medication. Lifestyle changes Usually, with a few basic changes in activities, IBS will improve over time. Here are some tips to help ease symptoms: Avoid caffeine (in coffee , tea , and soda). Add fiber to your diet with foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains , and nuts. Go slowly, though. Adding too much fiber at once can lead to gas and bloating. A fiber supplement may be easier on your gut than foods loaded with fiber. Drink at least eight glasses of water per day. Don't smoke. Learn to relax, either by getting more exercise or by reducing stress in your life. Find a relaxation technique that works for you. There are lots to choose from, including: Diaphragmatic/belly breathing Progressive muscle relaxation Visualization/positive imagery Meditation Eat slowly and chew your food thoroughly to ease digestion. Don’t skip meals. Instead, stick to a regular meal schedule to help keep your bowels moving regularly. Eat smaller meals more often instead of big meals. Keep a record of the foods you eat so you can figure out which foods bring on bouts of IBS. Sleep 7 to 9 hours every night, which can help relieve IBS-triggering stress Exercise regularly – think walking, biking, swimming, or other workouts that raise your heart rate – with a goal of at least 30 minutes a day, 5 days per week. Skip carbonated beverages. Those bubbles can irritate your gut. Therapy Anxiety and depression often travel with IBS, and managing those conditions may ease your IBS symptoms. Talk to you doctor about the following therapies. One of them may be right for you. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) Biofeedback Hypnotherapy Medications The following types of drugs and supplements are used to treat IBS: Bulking agents, such as psyllium , wheat bran, and corn fiber, help slow the movement of food through the digestive system and may also help relieve symptoms. Antibiotics , such as rifaximin ( Xifaxan ), can change the amount of bacteria in your intestines . You take pills for 2 weeks. It can control symptoms for as long as 6 months. If they come back, you can be treated again. Other treatments can help with symptoms of IBS: Belly pain and bloating Antispasmodics can control colon muscle spasms, but experts are unsure that these drugs help. They also have side effects, such as making you drowsy and constipated, that make them a bad choice for some people. Antidepressants may also help relieve symptoms in some people. Probiotics are live bacteria and yeasts that are good for your health, especially your digestive system . Doctors often suggest them to help with digestive problems. These are available as supplements but also can be found in a variety of foods, such as yogurt, kombucha, and cottage cheese. Check the food label for “live active cultures.” Constipation Linaclotide (Linzess) is a capsule you take once daily on an empty stomach , at least 30 minutes before your first meal of the day. It helps to relieve constipation by helping bowel movements happen more often. It’s not for anyone 17 years old or younger. The drug's most common side effect is diarrhea. Lubiprostone ( Amitiza ) can treat IBS with constipation in people AFAB when other treatments have not helped. Studies haven’t fully shown that it works well in men. Common side effects include nausea , diarrhea, and belly pain. More serious side effects may include fainting , swelling of the arms and legs, breathing problems , and heart palpitations . Plecanatide (Trulance) has been shown to treat constipation without the usual side effects of cramping and belly pain. The once-a-day pill can be taken with or without food. It works to increase gastrointestinal fluid in your gut and encourage regular bowel movements. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is an osmotic laxative and causes water to remain in the stool, which results in softer stools. This medication may work best for those who can't tolerate dietary fiber supplements. Tegaserod is a drug for people AFAB . It works by speeding up the motion in your gut. This effect shortens the time stool remains in the bowel, and helps lessen symptoms such as belly pain and constipation. Tenapanor (IBSRELA) increases bowel movements and decreases belly pain. Diarrhea Alosetron ( Lotronex ) can help relieve stomach pain and slow your bowels to relieve diarrhea, but there can be serious side effects, so it’s only to be used by people AFAB with severe IBS-D whose symptoms aren’t helped by other treatments. Bile acid sequestrants are cholesterol -lowering medications. Taken orally, they work in the intestines by binding bile acids and reducing stool production. Eluxadoline (Viberzi) is prescribed to help reduce bowel contractions, belly cramps, and diarrhea. Loperamide ( Imodium ) works by slowing down the movement of the gut. This decreases the number of bowel movements and makes the stool less watery. Make sure to follow your doctor's instructions when taking IBS medications, including laxatives , which can be habit-forming if you don’t use them carefully. IBS Triggers While the cause of IBS remains unknown, it’s clear that certain things can trigger your symptoms. Avoiding those triggers can bring relief. But IBS triggers vary from person to person, so it’s important to identify those that affect you. Here are some common triggers that could be contributing to your IBS discomfort. Stress may cause spasms in your colon that make your symptoms worse. Periods. If you were assigned female at birth, you may notice that your IBS symptoms get worse during your menstrual cycle. Poor sleep has been linked to IBS symptoms, possibly because it contributes to stress. Caffeine. It's found in coffee, tea, and soda, as well as chocolate and some over-the-counter pain medications. Milk and milk-based foods like cheese and ice cream, which contain lactose. Yogurt’s an exception because it contains live cultures that break down lactose. Carbonated drinks. The bubbles may not be easy on your stomach. Foods and drinks that are high in fructose. These include many processed foods as well as some fruits, like apples, pears, and dried fruit, as well as fruit juices. Wheat. This may be due to carbs in foods like wheat bread rather than gluten. Artificial sweeteners. Check food labels for sorbitol, mannitol, isomalt, maltitol, and xylitol, sugar substitutes that can cause diarrhea. Alcohol. Drinking may worsen your symptoms. Cruciferous vegetables. Broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, and Brussels sprouts, as well as leafy greens like kale and mustard greens, can cause gas and mess with your bowel movements. Onions, leeks, and shallots. These can make you gassy and upset your stomach. Beans or legumes. These contain indigestible chemicals called saccharides that can make you gassy. Baked beans, chickpeas, lentils, and soybeans are particular culprits. Because there are so many possible triggers, you may find it helpful to keep a journal or diary to track how you react to certain foods or conditions. This can help you identify triggers and rule out suspects. Share your journal with your nutritionist or health care provider to help guide your care plan. IBS Diet If you have IBS, you may need to change your diet to better control your symptoms. Your doctor may suggest you try something called a low FODMAP diet that cuts down on different hard-to-digest carbs found in wheat, beans, and certain fruits and vegetables. FODMAP stands for fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols. Not all of these kinds of carbs may cause IBS symptoms for you, so your health care provider may suggest you start an elimination diet where you avoid eating all high FODMAP foods, then slowly reintroduce them to see which you react to. Once you know which ones trigger IBS symptoms, you can better avoid them. Common high FODMAP foods include beans and lentils; dairy products; fruits like apples, cherries, pears, and peaches; and wheat products. If you're concerned about getting enough calcium, you can try to get it from other foods, like spinach, turnip greens, tofu, yogurt, sardines, salmon with bones, calcium-fortified orange juice and breads, or calcium supplements. Irritable Bowel Syndrome Complications Because finding an IBS treatment that works can take time, other health problems can crop up in the meantime. None of the complications are life-threatening, though. IBS doesn't lead to cancer or other more serious bowel-related conditions. Here are some of the health issues it can cause: Impacted bowel: If you're constipated for a long time, stool can get blocked in your colon . Sometimes it can get so hard that you can't push it out. This is known as a fecal impaction. It can hurt and cause things like a headache , nausea , and vomiting. It happens most often with older adults. See your doctor right away if you have signs this may be happening. Food intolerance : Certain foods can make your IBS symptoms worse. What they are can be different for everyone. But some people feel better when they cut out wheat, dairy, coffee , eggs , yeast, potatoes, and citrus fruits. And fats and sugars can make diarrhea worse. Your doctor may suggest you try a FODMAP diet to cut out some carbohydrates that are hard to digest. Malnourishment: Cutting back on some types of foods can ease your IBS symptoms. But your body may not get all the nutrients it needs. A dietitian can help you find a diet that works for you. Hemorrhoids : Swollen blood vessels around your anus , the opening where stool comes out, can hurt and bleed. Very hard or very loose stools can make the situation worse. If the swollen vessels are inside your anus, they may fall far enough to stick out. You can often treat hemorrhoids at home with an over-the-counter cream. You also might try sitting on a cold ice pack. And be sure to keep the area clean. Pregnancy complications : Hormone changes and the physical pressure a baby puts on the bowel wall can cause digestive issues. Many people AFAB also choose to stop any IBS drugs they're taking. This can be better for the baby. But it can make parents-to-be more likely to have things like heartburn and indigestion . Quality of life: Flare-ups can happen without warning. Also, you may have diarrhea for a time and then be constipated. Not being able to predict how you'll feel can make it hard to go about your daily life. You also probably need to see your doctor often and are likely to miss more work than other people. It may be harder to focus when you're at your job. Managing stress , for example through exercise or meditation , can help. Depression and anxiety : It's common for people who have IBS to feel like they're losing control over their lives. If your symptoms are bad, you may find yourself always trying to map out the nearest bathroom. Because there's a link between your brain and gut, this kind of stress can make your IBS worse. The pain and the awkward symptoms you're dealing with can affect your mood. It may help to talk to a counselor about what's going on with you. Takeaways Doctors don’t know what causes IBS, but they do know that it does not raise your risk of more serious health conditions, like colorectal cancer. Still, its symptoms are unpleasant and can be painful. While no cure exists yet, treatment, including lifestyle changes, can ease your discomfort. Irritable Bowel Syndrome FAQs What really causes IBS? Experts don’t know, but it may be due to problems with the way your brain and your digestive system communicate with each other. Imbalances in your gut bacteria, serious infections, food intolerances, and stress in childhood all may contribute to IBS. How do you treat an IBS flare-up? Avoid your food triggers, drink plenty of water (not carbonated!), exercise, and get good sleep. Medications and fiber supplements can help control symptoms like diarrhea and constipation. How long do IBS attacks last? Everyone with IBS experiences it differently. For some people, symptoms occur everyday. Other people may go for long periods without symptoms. In general, episodes of IBS are frequent but unpredictable. What should I eat during an IBS flare-up? Choose foods that are easier on your stomach, like cooked vegetables instead of raw ones. You may find it easier to digest proteins like eggs, chicken, turkey, fish, and tofu. Cook with a minimal amount of fat, opting to roast, bake, steam, or boil foods. If you’re constipated, foods like oats and flax seeds can help."
51,Why Am I Losing My Voice?,"Maybe you first notice something is wrong when your normally clear-as-a-bell voice gets a little bit husky. Pretty soon all that your friends can hear is a lot of croaking when you try to speak up. Too much singing in the shower, you wonder, or is something more serious to blame? Check out these culprits that could explain why you're hoarse. A Cold When you speak, air passes through the voice box in your throat and hits the two bands called vocal cords. Your voice makes sounds when they vibrate. A cold can throw a wrench into this smooth-running machine. Your throat gets inflamed and sore. Then your vocal cords swell, which affects the way they vibrate. The end result: You're hoarse. Rest your voice and drink plenty of fluids. Your volume will return when you recover. Learn more ways to treat the common cold . You Use Your Voice Too Much Each time you talk or sing, you use different muscles, including some in your mouth and throat. Just like other muscles in your body, overuse of the ones that help you speak can lead to fatigue , strain, and injury. The wrong technique can also bring on hoarseness. Here are some common things that you may be doing wrong: Speak, sing, yell, or cough too much Use a pitch that's higher or lower than normal when you talk Cradle your phone between your head and shoulder Smoking Cigarette smoke irritates your vocal cords, which can lead to long-term voice problems. Studies show that former and current smokers are about three times more likely to have a voice disorder than people who never smoke. Smoking can also raise your risk of developing a small, noncancerous growth called a polyp on your vocal cords. It can cause your voice to become low, breathy, and hoarse. Find out how smoking can also affect your heart. Allergies When you think about allergies, you probably think of a runny nose, itchy eyes , and sneezing . But they can also take a toll on your voice in several ways: An allergic reaction can cause your vocal cords to swell. Postnasal drip -- when mucus moves from your nose into your throat -- can irritate your vocal cords. Coughing and clearing your throat can strain your vocal cords. Antihistamine drugs for allergies can dry out mucus in your throat. This may harm your vocal cords, which need moisture to work. Learn ways you can allergy-proof your environment. Rheumatoid Arthritis It's an autoimmune disease that causes pain, swelling, and stiffness in your joints. About 1 in 3 people with RA get vocal problems, including a sore throat and loss of voice. That's because the condition can affect tiny joints in your face and throat, which leads to problems with your breathing and the way your vocal cords work. Read more about how RA can affect your body . Trouble With Your Thyroid This butterfly-shaped gland in your lower neck pumps out a hormone that controls a number of functions in your body. When your thyroid doesn't make enough of it, one symptom you might have is a hoarse voice. If you have a goiter -- when your thyroid gets larger -- you may cough a lot and have problems with your speech. A growth on the thyroid , or a nodule, can also affect the way you speak. Learn more about thyroid nodules . GERD It's a condition that makes stomach acid wash back up into the esophagus , a tube that leads into your throat. The main symptom is heartburn, but GERD can also weaken your voice. Stomach acid can irritate your vocal cords, throat, and esophagus. This leads to a hoarse voice, wheezing, and too much mucus in your throat. Find out how GERD is diagnosed and treated . Laryngitis It's not a disease, but a catch-all word that means you've lost your voice. If it happens suddenly, it's called ""acute"" laryngitis. You can get it from a cold or overusing your voice. You can get long-term laryngitis if you breathe in something irritating, like smoke or chemical fumes. It also develops if you get yeast infections of the vocal cords, which can happen if you use asthma inhalers or have problems with your immune system, the body's defense against germs. Learn more about laryngitis symptoms . Nodules, Polyps, and Cysts Although experts aren't sure why, non-cancerous growths can appear on your vocal cords. They believe that heavy overuse of the voice, such as too much yelling or speaking, can be a cause. There are three types: Nodules. These callus -like formations usually grow in the middle of the vocal cord. They tend to go away if you give your voice enough rest. Polyps. These typically appear on one side of the vocal cord. They have a variety of sizes and shapes. Unlike nodules, they often need to be removed surgically. Cysts. They're fluid-filled or semi-solid masses of tissue that grow near or beneath the surface of your vocal cord. If they make serious changes to your voice, your doctor will likely recommend surgery to remove them. Nervous System Diseases A condition that affects your nerves, like Parkinson's disease, can affect the muscles in your face and throat. Nearly 90% of people with Parkinson's get some form of a speech or voice disorder. Parkinson's causes the parts of the brain that control movement and coordination to decline. This may mean that you're no longer able to control the muscles needed for speech. Learn how doctors diagnose Parkinson's disease . Laryngeal Cancer Long-term hoarseness or voice loss may be a sign of throat cancer. Other symptoms for the disease are: Pain when swallowing Pain in the ear Trouble breathing Lump in the neck Get more information on throat cancer diagnosis and treatment . If your voice problems last for more than 2 weeks, see a doctor."
52,What Is Basal Ganglia Calcification?,"Basal ganglia calcification is a very rare condition that happens when calcium builds up in your brain , usually in the basal ganglia, the part of your brain that helps control movement. Other parts of your brain can be affected as well. You're most likely to get basal ganglia calcification between the ages of 30 and 60, though it can happen at any time. Most people who develop it are in good health before they find out they have it. It should not be confused with familial idiopathic basal ganglia calcification or primary familial brain calcification, also called Fahr’s disease or Fahr’s syndrome. As the name suggests, this form of basal ganglia calcification is inherited, but it is also rare and more serious. It is a progressive disease with no known cure. Calcification can occur in many parts of the brain and is most commonly benign with no symptoms and not associated with Fahr's disease. Causes Basal ganglia calcification sometimes happens when you age. Calcium build-up in your basal ganglia can also happen because of infection, problems with your parathyroid gland, and for other reasons. Symptoms In most cases, you may have no symptoms at all. But if you do, there are usually two types: either movement-related or psychiatric. The exact symptoms depend on which part of your brain is affected. Movement symptoms: Clumsiness Walking unsteadily Talking more slowly than usual, or slurring your words Difficulty swallowing Involuntary movement of arms or legs Cramped muscles Stiff arms and legs (called spasticity) Tremors, muscle stiffness, lack of facial expression Psychiatric symptoms: Poor concentration Lapses in memory Mood changes Psychosis , or being out of touch with reality Dementia Other symptoms: Tiredness Migraines Seizures Vertigo , or dizziness Not being able to control when you urinate (called urinary incontinence ) Impotence Diagnosis Your doctors usually start with symptoms and family history. A CT scan , which combines many X-rays to make detailed pictures of parts of your body, is the most common imaging test used to detect it. But if there is calcification, they can’t always tell if it's because of the condition or something else. Imaging tests like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and X-rays might also show if there’s any calcium build-up in your brain. Your doctor might do special urine and blood tests to help rule out other problems. Testing of your genes is also possible if other things point to the illness. Treatment There is no cure, but there is treatment for the symptoms. For example, if you are anxious or depressed, see your doctor. There are medicines to help with mood issues. If you have seizures, certain anti-epileptic medicines can help. Or if you have migraines, you can take medicine to both prevent and treat them. If you have this condition, it’s a good idea to see your doctor or specialist every year to see if it’s changed or advanced."
53,What Are the Different Types of Doctors?,"You may call them simply doctors. But most doctors have extra expertise in one type of medicine or another. In fact, there are several hundred medical specialties and subspecialties. Here are the most common types of doctors you'll likely see. Allergists/Immunologists They treat immune system disorders such as asthma , eczema , food allergies , insect sting allergies , and some autoimmune diseases. Anesthesiologists These doctors give you drugs to numb your pain or to put you under during surgery, childbirth , or other procedures. They monitor your vital signs while you’re under anesthesia.

Some of them specialize in preventive medicine or travel medicine. Internists These primary-care doctors treat both common and complex illnesses, usually only in adults. You’ll likely visit them or your family doctor first for any condition. Internists often have advanced training in a host of subspecialties, like heart disease , cancer , or adolescent or sleep medicine. With additional training (called a fellowship), internists can specialize in cardiology, gastroenterology, endocrinology, nephrology, pulmonology, and other medical sub-specialties.

Obstetricians and Gynecologists Often called OB/GYNs, these doctors focus on women's health , including pregnancy and childbirth. They do Pap smears, pelvic exams, and pregnancy checkups. OB/GYNs are trained in both areas. But some of them may focus on women's reproductive health (gynecologists), and others specialize in caring for pregnant women (obstetricians). Oncologists These internists are cancer specialists. They do chemotherapy treatments and often work with radiation oncologists and surgeons to care for someone with cancer . Ophthalmologists You call them eye doctors. They can prescribe glasses or contact lenses and diagnose and treat diseases like glaucoma . Unlike optometrists, they’re medical doctors who can treat every kind of eye condition as well as operate on the eyes . Osteopaths Doctors of osteopathic medicine (DO) are fully licensed medical doctors just like MDs. Their training stresses a “whole body” approach. Osteopaths use the latest medical technology but also the body’s natural ability to heal itself. Otolaryngologists They treat diseases in the ears , nose, throat, sinuses , head, neck, and respiratory system . They also can do reconstructive and plastic surgery on your head and neck.

Radiologists They use X-rays, ultrasound , and other imaging tests to diagnose diseases. They can also specialize in radiation oncology to treat conditions like cancer. Rheumatologists They specialize in arthritis and other diseases in your joints, muscles, bones, and tendons. You might see them for your osteoporosis (weak bones), back pain , gout , tendinitis from sports or repetitive injuries, and fibromyalgia . Sleep Medicine Specialists They find and treat causes behind your poor sleep. They may have sleep labs or give you take-home tests to chart your sleep-wake patterns. Sports Medicine Specialists These doctors diagnose, treat, and prevent injuries related to sports and exercise . General Surgeons These doctors can operate on all parts of your body.

54,Developmental Delays in Young Children,"What Is a Developmental Delay? A developmental delay is when your child fallss behind their peers in one or more areas of emotional, mental, or physical growth. If your child' development is delayed, early treatment is the best way to help them make progress or even to catch up. There are many types of developmental delays in infants and young children. They include problems with: Language or speech Vision Movement – motor skills Social and emotional skills Thinking – cognitive skills Sometimes, there is a significant delay in two or more of these areas. When that happens, it’s called ""global developmental delay."" It refers to infants and preschoolers up to age 5 who show delays lasting at least 6 months. Developmental delays are different from developmental disabilities, which include such conditions as cerebral palsy , hearing loss , and autism spectrum disorder , which usually last for life. Motor skill developmental delays may be related to problems with gross motor skills, such as crawling or walking, or fine motor skills, such as using fingers to grasp a spoon. By 3 to 4 months of age, most children can reach for, grasp, or hold objects. (Photo Credit: iStock/Getty Images) Developmental Delay Causes Little children learn to crawl, talk, or use the toilet at different speeds. But sometimes a child may reach those milestones much later than other kids. There are many reasons for such delays, including: Being born prematurely Genetic conditions like Down syndrome or muscular dystrophy Poor eyesight or hearing Malnutrition A mother's alcohol or drug use during pregnancy Physical abuse or neglect Lack of oxygen during delivery Speech and Language Delays These aren't unusual delays in toddlers . Language and speech problems are the most common developmental delays. Speech refers to verbal expression, including the way words are formed. Language is a broader system of expressing and receiving information, such as being able to understand gestures. Possible causes. A variety of problems may cause language and speech delays, including: Exposure to more than one language, which can cause mild delays in toddlers but not delays by the time they reach school age A learning disability Child abuse or neglect A problem with the muscles controlling speech – a disorder called dysarthria Hearing loss , which may happen in children who have severe middle ear infections or as a result of certain medications , trauma, or genetic disorders Autism spectrum disorders – a group of neurological disorders that may involve impaired communication as well as impaired social interaction and cognitive skills No cause can be found Types of treatment. If you or your child’s doctor suspects a speech delay, a referral will be placed for an evaluation by a speech-language pathologist. This specialist may test your child’s hearing, assess your child’s receptive and expressive language, and then plan for speech therapy sessions. If the delay is mild, the specialist or doctor may suggest that you: Communicate more with your child – talk, sing, and encourage repetition. Read daily to your child. Reinforce speech and language throughout the day. Get treatment for middle ear infections . Warning signs of speech or language delays. Contact your child's doctor if your child has any of the following signs at the ages shown. Also, watch for any loss of skills that have already been learned. By 3 to 4 months, contact the doctor if your child: Doesn't respond to loud noises Doesn't babble Begins babbling but doesn't try to imitate sounds (by 4 months) By 7 months, contact the doctor if your child: Doesn't respond to sounds Doesn't take turns making sounds with you By 1 year, contact the doctor if your child doesn't: Use any single words (like ""mama"") Understand words like ""bye-bye"" or ""no"" By 2 years, contact the doctor if your child: Can't speak at least 15 words Doesn't use two-word phrases without repetition; can only imitate speech Doesn't use speech to express more than immediate needs Doesn't use more movements other than waving or pointing, like shaking their head ""yes"" or ""no"" Can't point to two or more body parts when asked Vision Developmental Delays Newborn baby vision is normally blurry. Then it improves by about 3 months of age as your child's eyes begin to work together to track and focus on things. But sometimes, this doesn't happen or other vision problems show up. Possible causes of vision delays. Refractive errors, such as nearsightedness and farsightedness , are common in children. Other eye problems include: Amblyopia (lazy eye), poor vision in one eye that may also appear to turn outward Infantile cataracts – a clouding of the eye's lens – or another inherited problem (these problems are rare) Retinopathy of prematurity , an eye disease that sometimes affects premature infants Strabismus – also called cross eyes – eyes that turn in, out, up, or down Types of treatment for vision delays. Early treatment can help correct many vision problems. Depending on the eye problem your child has, they may need: Glasses or contact lenses Special glasses Surgery An eye patch Warning signs of vision problems. Contact your child's doctor if your child has any of the following signs at the ages shown. Also, watch for any loss of skills that have already been learned. By 3 months, contact the doctor if your child: Doesn't follow moving objects with their eyes Doesn't notice hands (by 2 months) Has trouble moving one or both eyes in all directions Crosses eyes most of the time By 6 months, contact the doctor if your child: Has one or both eyes turning in or out all the time Has constant tearing or eye drainage Doesn't follow near objects (1 foot away) or far objects (6 feet away) with both eyes Doesn't look at and/or touch the image of themselves in the mirror If your child's doctor notes any problems, the doctor may refer your child to an ophthalmologist for further evaluation. Motor Skill Delays Motor skill developmental delays may be related to problems with gross motor skills, such as crawling or walking, or fine motor skills, such as using fingers to grasp a spoon. Possible causes of motor skill delays. Children who are born prematurely may not develop muscles at the same rate as other children. Other possible causes of motor delays include: Ataxia , a defect that impairs muscle coordination Cerebral palsy, a condition caused by brain damage before birth Cognitive delays Myopathy, a disease of the muscles Problems with vision Spina bifida , a genetic condition causing partial or total paralysis of the lower part of the body Types of treatment for motor skill delays. Your child's doctor may suggest taking certain steps at home to encourage more physical activity . Your child may also need physical therapy for gross motor delays. Certain types of physical or occupational therapy may help with fine motor problems or with sensory processing disorder , which happens when the brain has trouble receiving and responding to information that comes in through the senses. Warning signs of motor skill delays. Contact your child's doctor if your child has any of the following signs at the ages shown. Also, watch for any loss of skills that have already been learned. By 3 to 4 months, contact the doctor if your child doesn't: Reach for, grasp, or hold objects Support their head well Bring objects and hands to their mouth (by 4 months) Use arms to swing at toys Push onto forearms or elbows while on their stomach Push down with legs when their feet are placed on a firm surface (by 4 months) By 7 months, contact the doctor if your child: Has stiff and tight or very floppy muscles Flops their head when pulled into a sitting position Reaches with one hand only or does not actively reach for objects Has trouble getting objects to their mouth Doesn't roll over in either direction (by 5 months) Doesn't bear weight on their legs when you pull them up to a standing position Doesn't use straight arms to push up when on their stomach (by 6 months) Doesn't bear weight on hands for support when sitting (by 6 months) By 1 year, contact the doctor if your child: Can't get to sitting position by themselves and sit without help (9 months) Doesn't crawl Drags one side of their body while crawling Can't stand when supported Doesn't walk while holding on to furniture By 2 years, contact the doctor if your child: Can't walk (by 18 months) Doesn't develop a heel-to-toe walking pattern or walks only on toes Can't push a wheeled toy Doesn't run Can't go up a few steps without help Can't use a spoon Social and Emotional Delays Children may have problems interacting with adults or other children, called social and/or emotional developmental delays. Usually these problems show up before a child begins school. Possible causes. Some causes of social and emotional delays include: Neglect from early institutionalization, like living in an orphanage, or parental neglect Ineffective parenting or attachment problems Cognitive delays An unknown cause Another common cause of social and emotional developmental delays falls under the umbrella diagnosis for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This was previously referred to as pervasive developmental disorder (PDD), autism , Asperger's , and other names. ASD includes disorders that can cause a child to have a hard time communicating, have repetitive behaviors, and have language problems. Types of treatment. There is no known cure for these conditions. But treatment may include: Special types of behavioral and skill-oriented therapy Medication that may help with some problem behaviors As with most types of delays, early treatment can make a big difference in the progress your child makes. Depending on the diagnosis, treatment may also include play therapy or steps to help with attachment between parent and child. Warning signs of social or emotional delays. Contact your child's doctor if your child has any of the following signs at the ages shown. Also, watch for any loss of skills that have already been learned. By 3 to 4 months, contact the doctor if your child doesn't: Smile at people Make a small laugh when you try to make them laugh Look at you, make sounds, or make movements to get your attention Pay attention to new faces, or seems frightened by them By 7 months, contact the doctor if your child: Refuses to cuddle Shows no affection for parents or caregivers Shows no enjoyment around people Can't be comforted at night (after 5 months) Doesn't smile without prompting (by 5 months) Doesn't laugh or squeal (by 6 months) Shows no interest in games of peekaboo (by 8 months) Doesn't like to look at self in mirror (by 6 months) By 1 year, contact the doctor if your child shows no: Back-and-forth sharing of sounds, smiles, or facial expressions (at 9 months) Back-and-forth gestures, such as waving, reaching, or pointing Interest in playing games like patty-cake Cognitive Delays Problems with thinking, or cognitive delays, may be due to one or more of these reasons: Genetic defects Significant medical problems before birth Exposure to something harmful in the environment, such as a toxin Neglect Possible causes. Other potential causes of cognitive delays include: A wide range of learning disabilities Exposure to alcohol or toxins before birth or afterward, including lead poisoning Living in an institution, like an orphanage or a children's home, or neglect during infancy or early childhood Down syndrome and other genetic disorders Autism spectrum disorder Severe newborn medical problems No known cause Types of treatment for cognitive delays. As with most types of developmental delays, early treatment can make a big difference in the progress your child makes. Educational intervention can help your child develop specific cognitive skills. Educators and therapists may use play therapy or behavioral therapy and may also recommend specific steps you can take at home to help your child. Warning signs of cognitive delays. Contact your child's doctor if your child has any of the following signs at the ages shown. Also, watch for any loss of skills that have already been learned. By 1 year, contact the doctor if your child doesn't: Search for objects that are hidden while they watch Use gestures, such as waving Point to objects or pictures Put things into a container, like a small toy into a cup By 2 years, contact the doctor if your child doesn't: Know the function of common objects, such as a hairbrush, telephone, or spoon Follow simple instructions Imitate actions or words Hold an object in one hand while using the other hand, like taking a top off a bottle Play with more than one toy at a time Use buttons, knobs, or other parts on a toy How to Help a Child With Developmental Delays Remember: There is a wide range of normal development in children. Most developmental delays in children are not serious, and children eventually catch up. Even children who do have serious delays can make big improvements when treatment begins as early as possible. The key is to step in early. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) says eligible infants and toddlers should get services such as speech or physical therapy, social services, and dietary guidance. IDEA also says children younger than 3 years old who are at risk of developmental delay should be eligible for certain early intervention services without a confirmed diagnosis. And children until age 21 can receive special public education specially made for their developmental delays."
55,Spermatocele,"What Is a Spermatocele? A spermatocele (also called a spermatic or epididymal cyst ) is a fluid-filled sac that grows in the epididymis -- a tightly coiled tube about 20 feet long where the sperm matures as it passes through. It's in the scrotum and surrounds the back and top of the testicle. Spermatoceles vary in size. They typically don’t hurt, but they could cause pain if they grow too large. Spermatoceles can be smooth. They might also be filled with a whitish, cloudy fluid. Sometimes, they hold sperm. Most of the time, they’re benign (not cancerous). Still, if you notice a growth near or in your penis or scrotum (the pouch that holds your testicles), see your doctor to have it checked. Spermatoceles don’t impact fertility. Spermatocele Causes and Risk Factors Spermatoceles often contain pools of dead sperm. Doctors aren’t sure what causes this. Often, spermatoceles develop for no specific reason at all. Sometimes they might happen when one of the tubes that transport and store sperm gets blocked. Spermatocele risk factors Spermatoceles are actually quite common. About 3 out of 10 men will get them at some point in their lives. Men ages 20-50 are most likely to get them. They don’t have many known risk factors. Men whose mothers took the drug diethylstilbestrol in pregnancy might get them more. Doctors stopped using this drug in 1971. Spermatocele Diagnosis Most of the time, spermatoceles don’t hurt, so you may not have any symptoms. You might only feel a bump while examining your testicles. Your doctor might find it during an exam. As the cyst gets bigger, you may feel heaviness in your testicle. You might also notice a mass or swelling behind or above your testicle. Your doctor will likely do a couple of tests to make sure the growth is a spermatocele and not a tumor. They’ll probably start with a physical exam . You’ll also have a transillumination or an ultrasound . Transillumination is where your doctor shines a light through your scrotum. If the growth is a spermatocele, the light will shine through it. If it’s a mass, it won't. Ultrasound is the next step if transillumination doesn’t show fluid. This test uses high-frequency sound waves to create images on a screen. Spermatocele Treatment Most of the time, they’re not treated. Your doctor may prescribe pain relievers to make you more comfortable. Aspiration is a procedure that can help relieve some of the pain and pressure of spermatoceles. Your doctor will insert a needle into the cyst to remove some of the fluid. If the cyst refills and comes back, your doctor can do a procedure called a sclerotherapy. Your doctor will drain some of the fluid from the spermatocele. Then they’ll use a substance that causes the sac to fill with scar tissue. This tissue could lower the risk of the spermatocele coming back. But it can damage the epididymis. Your doctor may suggest this option only if you’re not interested in having children. In rare cases (if the spermatocele is getting in the way of your daily life), your doctor could remove it through surgery. Your doctor will numb the area, make a small incision (cut) in your scrotum or groin, and remove the growth. Spermatocele Prevention There’s no way to prevent a spermatocele. But, it’s a good idea to check your scrotum regularly to notice changes, including any masses. Follow these steps to examine your testicles: Using a mirror, look for any swelling. Examine each testicle with both hands, placing the index and middle fingers underneath and thumbs on top. Gently roll each testicle between your thumbs and fingers. Do a self-check once a month. This way, it will be easier to notice if anything changes. If you feel a lump or anything else unusual, call your doctor."
56,Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia,"Autoimmune hemolytic anemia , or AIHA, is a rare type of anemia . When you have anemia, your bone marrow doesn't make enough red blood cells . Or these cells don't work as well as they should. Red blood cells carry oxygen to your body. When you have too few red blood cells, your body can't get enough oxygen, leaving you feeling tired or short of breath. What is AIHA? Red blood cells are made in the spongy material called bone marrow deep inside your bones. These blood cells normally live for about 120 days. If you have autoimmune hemolytic anemia, your body’s immune system attacks and destroys red blood cells faster than your bone marrow can make new ones. Sometimes these red blood cells live for only a few days. Most people who get AIHA are middle-aged or older. It’s rare in children, and it usually shows up soon after a viral illness and goes away on its own. If your teenager gets it, it could be a sign they have some other health problem. Types of AIHA Autoimmune hemolytic anemia is classified in a few different ways: Primary AIHA: Appears by itself Secondary AIHA: Affects you because you have another illness. The disease is also classified by the temperature at which red blood cells are damaged: Warm antibody hemolytic anemia: The immune reaction takes place at or above normal body temperature. Cold antibody hemolytic anemia: Red blood cells are destroyed when you’re exposed to cold. Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia Signs and Symptoms Many of the symptoms of AIHA are the same as those of other forms of anemia. You may have: Chills Fast heartbeat, known as tachycardia Pale skin that may start to yellow Shortness of breath Weakness and fatigue Chest pain Yellow skin or whites of the eyes ( jaundice ) Dark urine A feeling of abdominal fullness related to an enlarged spleen Some symptoms are different depending on which type of AIHA you have. With cold antibody hemolytic anemia, you may also notice: Cold hands and feet Bluish or reddish color in hands and feet Headache Digestive problems Pain in the back and legs AIHA Causes You can get autoimmune hemolytic anemia if you have an autoimmune disease like lupus . Normally when your immune system spots foreign invaders like bacteria and viruses, it makes proteins called antibodies to attack them. When you have AIHA, your immune system makes antibodies that mistakenly attack your own red blood cells. Other diseases and medications can also cause autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Some of these are: Cancers, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia and non- Hodgkin's lymphoma Infections like Mycoplasma pneumoniae Medicines such as penicillin , methyldopa ( Aldomet ), quinine ( Qualaquin ), and sulfonamides Viruses such as Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, HIV , and hepatitis AIHA Diagnosis If you think you could have any type of anemia, you should talk to your doctor. They may refer you to a hematologist, a doctor who specializes in blood diseases. They’ll most likely discuss your past medical history, medications you take, and talk about your symptoms. They’ll  also request a blood test called a complete blood count, or CBC , to look for signs of anemia. This test measures: The number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets The size of your red blood cells The protein in your red blood cells that carries oxygen (hemoglobin) How much space red blood cells take up in your blood (hematocrit) A low red blood cell count and low hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are signs of anemia. If your CBC test results point to anemia, the doctor might want to do more tests. You might get one of these: Reticulocyte count. This measures the number of young red blood cells in your body. A high reticulocyte count means your bone marrow is making a lot more cells to replace the ones your body has destroyed. Coombs' test. The doctor will do this test to see if your body is making antibodies against red blood cells. Peripheral smear. Your doctor will check your red blood cells under a microscope for signs of blood cell destruction. Bilirubin test. Levels of this substance rise when blood cells are destroyed. Haptoglobin test. This protein clears debris from damaged red cells out of the bloodstream. Levels will be low when it’s being used heavily. Cold agglutinin titer. The doctor may test your level of these antibodies that attack red blood cells at cold temperatures. Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia Treatment If you have a disease like lupus that’s causing your anemia, your doctor will treat it first. If a medication is the cause, you'll likely have to stop taking that medicine. If your AIHA is mild, you may not need treatment. Doctors usually first prescribe steroids , such as hydrocortisone or prednisone , to stop your immune system from attacking your red blood cells. A medicine called rituximab may make steroids work even better. If you don’t improve, you may need surgery to remove your spleen. That’s where much of the destruction of red blood cells takes place. Other medicines such as azathioprine ( Imuran ) and cyclophosphamide ( Cytoxan ) can be used to suppress the immune system. You may need a blood transfusion."
57,Gaucher Disease,"What Is Gaucher Disease? Gaucher disease is a rare condition passed down through your family. (Credit: iStock/Getty Images) Gaucher disease is a rare condition that can cause a variety of symptoms, from weakening of your bones to easy bruising. There's no cure. But depending on which type you have, treatment can help you manage some of the symptoms. Gaucher causes problems with the way your body gets rid of a certain kind of fat. With all types of this disease, an enzyme you need to break fat down doesn't work right. Fat builds up, especially in your liver, spleen, and bone marrow, and causes problems. There are three main types of Gaucher disease. Type 1, also known as non-neuronopathic Gaucher, is the most common. If you have it, your symptoms may be mild, moderate, or serious. Some people don't have any at all. There are many treatments for type 1. Type 2 and type 3 are more serious. Both affect the central nervous system. Babies with type 2 usually don't live past age 2. Type 3 also causes damage to the brain and spinal cord, but symptoms show up later in childhood. Your blood might not clot well, or you might get anemia . It can also cause bone mineral loss that leads to pain and easily broken bones. It's passed along in families -- about 1 in 450 people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent (from Eastern and Central Europe) have the condition. It's the most common genetic disease that affects Jewish people. Whether you have the disease or are the parent of a child who has it, it's important to get support from family, friends, and perhaps a support group. Causes of Gaucher Disease Gaucher disease isn't something you ""catch,"" like a cold or the flu. It's an inherited condition that's caused by a problem with the GBA gene and passed down through your family. You get the disease when both of your parents pass along a damaged GBA gene to you. You can pass a faulty gene on to your children even if you don't have Gaucher disease. Symptoms of Gaucher Disease Symptoms vary a lot from person to person and depend in part on what type of Gaucher disease you've got. Type 1. Symptoms of type 1 can appear at any time in your life, but they usually show up by the teen years. Sometimes the disease is so mild you won't notice any problems. Some symptoms you might have are: Easy bruising, caused by low levels of blood platelets Nosebleeds Tiredness , caused by anemia (low levels of red blood cells) Enlarged spleen or liver, which makes your belly look swollen Bone problems like pain, breaks, or arthritis Lung disease Type 2. This very serious type affects infants, usually when they're 3 to 6 months old. Symptoms include: Slow back-and-forth eye movement Not gaining weight or growing as expected, called ""failure to thrive"" A high-pitched sound when breathing Seizures Brain damage , especially to the brain stem Enlarged liver or spleen Inability to swallow Pneumonia Throat muscle spasms Collodion skin, which looks like a thin, shiny coating Slow heart rate Infections Lung problems Bluish skin Perinatal lethal Gaucher disease . An infant with this form of type 2 usually lives only a few days. The symptoms include: Too much fluid in the baby's body before or soon after they're born Dry, scaly skin (called ichthyosis) and other skin problems Enlarged liver and spleen Serious brain and spinal cord problems Swollen stomach Unusual facial features Type 3. Like type 2, it starts in childhood, but usually at a later age. The timing varies, but it usually shows up by the teen years. Type 3 brings the same blood and bone problems that type 1 does and also causes symptoms like: Trouble moving eyes side to side or up and down Lung disease that gets worse A slow breakdown in mental ability Problems controlling arms and legs Muscle spasms or shocks Your child may feel very ill and might need help to eat or get extra nutrition. As type 3 symptoms get worse, they may need help to dress, bathe, or get around the house. With the right treatments, people with type 3 can live into their 20s or 30s. There are technically three varieties of type 3 Gaucher: 3a, 3b, and 3c. But their symptoms often overlap. Type 3b may cause liver or spleen problems earlier. Type 3c, also called cardiovascular Gaucher disease, mostly affects your heart. Cardiovascular Gaucher disease (type 3c). This rare type causes symptoms like: Hardening of the heart valves and blood vessels Bone disease Enlarged spleen Eye problems Gaucher Disease Diagnosis When you go to your doctor, they might ask: When did you notice your symptoms? What's your family's ethnic background? Have past generations of your family had similar medical problems? Did any children in your extended family pass away before age 2? If your doctor thinks it's Gaucher disease, they can confirm that with a blood or saliva test. They'll also do tests regularly to track the condition. You may have an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan to see if your liver or spleen is swollen. You might also get a bone density test to check for any loss of bone. When Gaucher disease runs in your family, blood or saliva tests can help you find out if you could pass the disease to your child. Questions for Your Doctor If you just found out that you or your child has Gaucher disease, it's natural to have lots of questions and concerns about what to expect. Some things you may want to ask your doctor include: Will the symptoms change over time? If so, how? Which treatments are best? Do these treatments have side effects? What can I do about them? Is there a clinical trial that could help? Are there new symptoms I should watch for? How often do I need to see you? Are there other specialists I should see? Does having this disease mean I have a higher chance of getting other diseases? Should I add my name to a Gaucher disease registry? If I have more children, what are the chances they'll have Gaucher disease? Gaucher Disease Treatment How your doctor treats Gaucher disease depends on several things. Some treatments can only be used by adults. Others are designed for a specific type of Gaucher. If your symptoms are mild, you may not need any treatment. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is one choice for people who have type 1 and some with type 3. It helps ease anemia , build bone strength to ease pain and avoid breaks, and shrinks an enlarged spleen or liver. ERT doesn't work as well if you have type 3 disease that gives you brain or nervous system problems like seizures. That's because the drug can't get from your blood into your brain. Enzyme replacement therapy medications include: Imiglucerase ( Cerezyme ) Taliglucerase alfa ( Elelyso ) Velaglucerase alfa ( VPRIV ) These are IV drugs. The medicine drips into your vein through a small tube. You'll get this treatment every 2 weeks at the doctor's office in a session that takes 1 to 2 hours. Other medications for type 1 are eliglustat ( Cerdelga ) and miglustat ( Zavesca ). You take them as pills. They curb the process in your body that leads to fat buildup when you have an enzyme shortage. Eliglustat is a newer drug you take twice a day. It may not work well for people whose bodies break down the drug too quickly. Miglustat is for adults with mild to moderate type 1 Gaucher who weren't helped by ERT. You swallow a capsule three times a day. There's no treatment that can stop type 3 from damaging the brain, but researchers are always looking for new ways to fight the disease. Other treatments that can help symptoms are: Blood transfusions for anemia Medications to strengthen your bones, prevent the buildup of fat, and ease pain Joint replacement surgery to help you move better Surgery to remove a swollen spleen Stem cell transplant to reverse type 1 symptoms. This procedure is complicated and can cause both short-term and long-term problems, so it's rarely used. Pain treatments. Kids and adults with Gaucher may take drugs like acetaminophen or ibuprofen for mild pain or opioids for stronger pain. Antidepressants, anti-anxiety drugs, and muscle relaxers may also help with pain. Vitamin D, calcium, or other supplements may help ease Gaucher symptoms too. Your doctor may recommend them if they think you're not getting enough in your diet. What to Expect Because the disease is different for each person, you'll need to work with your doctor to make sure you're getting the right care. Treatment can help you feel better and might help you live longer. You might consider joining a clinical trial . Scientists use them to study new methods to treat Gaucher disease. These trials test new drugs to see if they're safe and if they work. They often are a way for people to try new medicine that isn't available to everyone. Your doctor can tell you if one of these trials might be a good fit. If your child has Gaucher, they might not grow as quickly as other kids. They might be late in reaching puberty. Depending on your symptoms, they may need to avoid contact sports or limit your movement. Some people have very bad pain and fatigue. It may take extra effort to be active. Little things can make a big difference, though. For example, wheelchairs or crutches can help when you're having trouble walking. Naps are also useful. If you have serious symptoms, you may need help every day and might not be able to live alone. Whether you have the disease or are caring for someone who has it, this is a tough condition to manage. When you get the support of others who face the same challenges, it can help you feel less isolated. Sharing information and tips can help make your daily life easier. Think about getting professional counseling. It might also help you manage your feelings and frustrations about living with Gaucher disease. Getting Support You can get information on resources and support groups from the National Gaucher Foundation. The organization has a mentor program that lets you connect with others who have the disease to share experiences and ideas for living with your condition."
58,What Are Lysosomal Storage Disorders?,"Lysosomal storage disorders are a group of more than 50 rare diseases. They affect the lysosome -- a structure in your cells that breaks down substances such as proteins, carbohydrates, and old cell parts so the body can recycle them. People with these disorders are missing important enzymes (proteins that speed up reactions in the body). Without those enzymes, the lysosome isn’t able to break down these substances. When that happens, they build up in cells and become toxic. They can damage cells and organs in the body. This article covers some of the most common lysosomal storage disorders. Types of Lysosomal Storage Disorders Each disorder affects a different enzyme and has its own set of symptoms. They include: Fabry disease : It affects your ability to make alpha-galactosidase A . This enzyme breaks down a fatty substance called globotriaosylceramide. Without the enzyme, this fat builds up in cells and damages them. Symptoms might include: Pain, numbness, tingling, or burning in the hands and feet Body aches Fever Tiredness Red or purple skin sores Trouble sweating Swelling in the lower legs, ankles , and feet Clouding of the cornea (the clear cover on the front of the eye ) Diarrhea , constipation , or both Trouble breathing Ringing in the ears and hearing loss Dizziness Abnormal heart rhythms, heart attack , and stroke Gaucher disease : A lack of glucocerebrosidase (GBA) causes this condition. This enzyme breaks down a fat called glucocerebroside. Without GBA, the fat builds up in the spleen , liver , and bone marrow. Gaucher disease comes in three types, each with different symptoms. In general, symptoms include: Anemia (low red blood cell count) Enlarged spleen and liver Easy bleeding and bruising Tiredness Bone pain and fractures Joint pain Eye problems Seizures Krabbe disease: This affects the nervous system . A lack of the enzyme galactosylceramidase causes this condition. This enzyme helps make and maintain myelin , the protective coating around nerve cells that helps nerves talk to each other. Symptoms start in the first few months of life and include: Muscle weakness Stiff limbs Trouble walking Vision and hearing loss Muscle spasms Seizures Metachromatic leukodystrophy ( MLD ): You can get MLD if you don’t have the enzyme arylsulfatase A . It normally breaks down a group of fats called sulfatides. Without the enzyme, these fats build up in white matter -- the part of the brain that contains nerve fibers. They destroy the myelin coating that surrounds and protects nerve cells. MLD comes in different forms. Symptoms can include: Loss of feeling in the hands and feet Seizures Trouble walking and talking Vision and hearing loss Mucopolysaccharidosis ( MPS ): This is a group of diseases that affects enzymes that break down certain carbohydrates. The unbroken carbohydrates build up in many different organs. Symptoms of MPS affect many parts of the body and can include: Short height Stiff joints Trouble speaking and hearing Ongoing runny nose Learning problems Heart issues Joint problems Trouble breathing Depression Niemann-Pick disease: This is a group of disorders. The most common forms are types A, B, and C. In types A and B, people lack an enzyme called acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) . It breaks down a fatty substance called sphingomyelin, which is found in every cell. In type C, the body can't break down cholesterol and fats in cells. Cholesterol builds up in the liver and spleen. Other fats build up in the brain . Symptoms of Niemann-Pick include: An enlarged liver and spleen Trouble moving your eyes up and down Jaundice (yellow skin and eyes ) Slow development Breathing problems Heart disease Pompe disease : It affects the enzyme alpha-glucosidase (GAA) . This enzyme breaks down the sugar glycogen into glucose. Without GAA, glycogen builds up in muscle cells and other cells. Symptoms include: Severe muscle weakness Poor muscle tone Lack of growth and weight gain in infants An enlarged heart , liver, or tongue Tay-Sachs disease: This is caused by a lack of the enzyme hexosaminidases A (Hex-A) . This enzyme breaks down a fatty substance called GM2 ganglioside in brain cells. Without it, the fat builds up in nerve cells and damages them. Babies with Tay-Sachs grow normally for the first few months of life. Then their development slows. They lose control over their muscles. It becomes harder for them to sit, crawl, and walk. Other symptoms include: A red spot in the back of the eye Vision and hearing loss Seizures How Do These Disorders Happen? Most lysosomal storage disorders are passed down from parents to their children. Usually, a child has to inherit the faulty gene from both parents. If a child gets the gene from only one parent, they will be a carrier and won't show symptoms. The faulty genes affect how your body makes enzymes that break down material in the cells. Lysosomal storage diseases are rare, but some forms are more common in certain groups of people. For example, Gaucher and Tay-Sachs happen more often in people of European Jewish descent. Symptoms The symptoms depend on which enzyme is missing. Each of these conditions has different symptoms based on the cells and organs it affects. Diagnosis Your doctor can test for these disorders in your baby during pregnancy . If you have a child with symptoms, blood tests can look for the enzyme that's missing. The doctor might also do these tests: MRI uses powerful magnets and radio waves to make pictures of the brain . Biopsy removes a small piece of tissue, which is checked under a microscope for signs of disease. Finding these diseases early is key. Treatments can slow lysosomal storage disorders and improve your child's outlook. Treatments Though there isn't a cure for lysosomal storage disorders, a few treatments can help. Enzyme replacement therapy delivers the missing enzyme through a vein (IV). Substrate reduction therapy reduces the substance that is building up in the cells. For example, the drug miglustat (Zavesca) treats one form of Gaucher disease. Stem cell transplant uses donated cells to help the body make the enzyme it's missing. Treatments to manage symptoms of the disease include: Medicine Surgery Physical therapy Dialysis (a treatment that removes toxic substances from the body)"
59,Black Widow Spider Bite,"The black widow is a medium-sized spider -- about a half-inch long. Two species are common to the United States: The southern black widow . This spider has a shiny, black, globe-shaped belly (abdomen). You’ll know it by the red hourglass mark on the underside. The northern black widow . You’ll notice a row of red spots down the middle of the upper surface of its abdomen. It also has two crosswise bars on the underside. Just to make things interesting, the markings can also be yellow or white. The spider may be brown or have red legs. These spiders are active at night. They prefer dark corners or crevices, like garages. They only bite when disturbed. The black widow spider produces a venom that affects the victim's nervous system. Some people are slightly affected by the venom, but others may have a serious response. Photo credit: iStock/Getty Images Symptoms of a Black Widow Spider Bite The black widow spider makes a venom that affects your nervous system . Some people are slightly affected by it, but others may have a serious response. You may feel serious pain, burning, swelling, and redness at the site. You may even see two fang marks. Other symptoms include: Muscles that begin to hurt and get stiff, usually within 8 hours Nausea or vomiting Trouble breathing Serious belly pain or cramping Heavy sweating Rash and itching Swollen eyelids Weakness or shaking You can't move your legs If you have serious symptoms like these, seek medical help right away. Many of the symptoms of a black widow bite can look like those of other conditions. But if you think you’ve been bitten by this spider, call your doctor or a poison control center right away. IMPORTANT: If you suspect your child was bitten by a black widow, get them to the emergency room. These bites can be fatal in young children as well as older people. In the meantime, you can try these tips to ease your symptoms and prevent further infection: Wash the area with soap and water. Apply a cold washcloth or ice pack wrapped in cloth to the area. Take an over-the-counter pain reliever like acetaminophen . If the bite is on your arm or leg, elevate it to prevent swelling. Apply an antibiotic cream or lotion to the bite. If possible, capture and kill the spider (place it in a plastic bag or jar) and take it to your doctor visit. This way, they’ll know for sure whether it was a black widow that bit you. the doctor will review your symptoms and decide what treatment, if any, you need. If your symptoms are serious, you may need muscle relaxants or stronger pain medicine. You might have to stay in the hospital, though that’s rarely the case. In the most serious cases, the doctor may inject you with antivenin. It’s a drug made from substances in the blood of horses. Antivenin neutralizes the black widow’s venom. That means it prevents it from causing you harm. Your doctor will only use this treatment after they've spoken with another doctor who has experience in treating these bites. Antivenin can cause a number of side effects, so if your doctor gives it to you, they’ll have to monitor you for about 8-12 days afterward. Prevention Black widow spiders live in cool, dark places like sheds and garages. They normally bite when they’re startled or surprised. To reduce your risk of being bitten, keep storage areas clean. And outside, try to avoid woodpiles, fallen tree branches, and other places they may hide."
60,Brown Recluse Spiders: What to Know,"It’s rare for someone to stumble upon a brown recluse spider because these eight-legged creatures are true to their name: They prefer to be left alone. They tend to live in indoor and outdoor spaces where people don’t go most of the time. If you do find yourself in the same place as one, though, it won’t want to attack you -- it’ll want to get out of your way. But if it feels trapped, it may bite you. Brown recluse spiders are one of two spiders found in the United States that can cause real trouble if they bite you. They produce harmful venom that may cause a painful sore at the site of the bite . It may cause even more severe symptoms in some people. If you have a run-in with a brown recluse, it’s wise to have a doctor check you out, just in case. What Does a Brown Recluse Spider Look Like? A brown recluse might not be brown, but tan. It has a violin-shaped area on the front half of its body, with the neck of the violin pointing toward the spider’s abdomen. It may be bigger than other spiders that you’re used to seeing. Its body can range in size from a quarter-inch to three-quarters of an inch, and its long legs make it appear even larger. Most spiders have eight eyes, but a brown recluse spider has six. Two are in the front, and there are two more on each side of its head. Brown recluses are found mostly in the Midwest or the South. The spider favors indoor spaces, like attics, garages, or dark closets. Outdoors, it hides in out-of-the-way places -- under logs, beneath porches, or within piles of rocks. Picture of a Brown Recluse Bite Brown recluse spider bite symptoms usually develop 2 to 8 hours after a bite. Brown Recluse Bite Symptoms Brown recluse spider bites often go unnoticed initially because they are usually painless bites. Occasionally, some minor burning that feels like a bee sting is noticed at the time of the bite. Symptoms usually develop 2-8 hours after a bite. Keep in mind that most bites cause little tissue destruction. Initially the bite site is mildly red and upon close inspection may reveal fang marks . Within a few hours, the redness gives way to pallor with a red ring surrounding the area, or a ""bull's-eye"" appearance. The lesion will often appear to flow downhill over the course of many hours. The center area will then often blister, which over 12-48 hours can sink, changing color, often turning bluish then black as this area of tissue dies. Within the first day or two after you’ve been bitten, you may notice: Pain or redness at the site of the bite A deep sore (ulcer) that forms where you were bitten Fever Chills Nausea Joint pain Feeling weak Seizures or coma (very rare) Brown Recluse Bite Diagnosis Your doctor will want to be as certain as they can that you were, in fact, bitten by a spider. It’ll help if you can describe what the spider looked like. Some people try to catch the bug to show the doctor. That’s fine, as long as you can do it safely. You might just try to take a photo of it. Brown Recluse Treatment If you suspect your small child was bitten by a brown recluse, see your doctor right away. Their bodies can’t ward off the dangerous effects of the spider’s venom. For adults, most brown recluse spider bites can be treated at home with good results. But about 10% of them cause ulcers or blisters that damage your skin so badly that you need a doctor’s care. If your symptoms are mild, try these simple home remedies: Clean it with soap and water. Apply antibiotic cream . If you were bitten on an arm or leg, keep it raised while you’re resting. This can reduce swelling. Put ice on it. Take over-the-counter pain medicine. Watch for more severe symptoms. See a doctor right away if you notice any of these symptoms: The bite has formed an ulcer or blister with a dark (blue, purple, or black) center. You’re in extreme pain. You have an infection at the site of the bite. You’re having trouble breathing. Some spider bites can have tetanus spores, so you might need a tetanus shot after you’ve been bitten. If you have an infection, you may need antibiotics."
61,Insect Sting vs. Insect Bite: What’s the Difference?,"What Are Insect Stings and Spider Bites? A sting happens when an insect injects venom into your skin. The venom travels through the bug’s stinger. If you get stung, you’ll feel pain. Your skin may turn red or swell at the site of the sting. In some cases, people who are allergic to the venom can have a life-threatening reaction. Doctors call this anaphylaxis. Among the most common stinging insects are: Wasps (including hornets and yellow jackets) Bees Fire ants An insect bite happens when a non-venomous bug pierces your skin and feeds on your blood. This may cause a bump (doctors call them “papules”) to form. The telltale sign is intense itching. Examples of biting insects include: Mosquitoes Fleas Bedbugs Lice Ticks and some spiders also bite, but technically they are arachnids, not insects. Ticks feed on your blood, but spiders do not. Also, some spiders have venom. You can have an allergic reaction to a bite. And bugs that carry disease pass it on through their bites. This is often the case with ticks (Lyme disease) and mosquitoes (malaria, Zika virus). Insect and Spider Bite Symptoms Most insect bites cause only minor irritation, with symptoms like swelling at the site of the bite or itching or burning. You might also feel numbness or tingling. An insect bite happens when a non-venomous bug pierces your skin and feeds on your blood. A sting is what happens when an insect injects poison (venom) into your skin. If you’ve been bitten by a venomous spider, you may notice any of the following: Intense pain at the site of the wound Stiffness or joint pain Muscle spasms Abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting Fever or chills Difficulty breathing or swallowing A wound that spreads or turns into a sore (tissue around the wound might also die) Dizziness Difficulty speaking Convulsions Allergic Reactions to Stings and Bites Insect stings and bites can cause severe allergic reactions. Doctors call this “ anaphylaxis .” Rarely, a spider bite can cause an allergic reaction that doctors call “anaphylactic shock.” It can be fatal. Call 911 if you have any of these symptoms: Rapid swelling of the lips, tongue, throat, or around the eyes Difficulty breathing Wheezing or hoarseness Severe itching, cramping, or numbness Dizziness A reddish rash or hives Stomach cramps Loss of consciousness If you have any of these things and have epinephrine on hand, don’t hesitate to use it, even if you’re not sure your symptoms are caused by allergies. Using an auto-injector pen as a precaution won’t harm you."
62,Varicose Veins and Spider Veins: Symptoms and Treatment,"Varicose veins are large, raised, swollen blood vessels that twist and turn. They usually develop in the legs and can be seen through the skin. They result from a weakening in the blood vessel wall or from faulty valves. They can show up anywhere on the body but most often appear on the legs or pelvic area. Spider veins are smaller, red, purple, and blue vessels that also twist and turn. Spider veins are easily visible through the skin, as well. They affect the capillaries, the body’s smallest blood vessels. Spider veins, which are red or blue, look like a spider’s web or tree branch. They are typically visible on the legs and face. Spider angioma or spider nervus is a common development of small blood vessels. Its name comes from its appearance which generally has a central red blood vessel with small capillaries radiating from it so that it resembles a spider.  The vascular cluster is benign and poses no harm. (Photo Credit: Richard Usatine, MD) What Causes Varicose Veins and Spider Veins? A number of things can put you at risk for varicose veins and spider veins . These include: Heredity Occupations that involve a lot of standing, such as nurses, hair stylists, teachers, and factory workers Obesity Hormonal influences of pregnancy, puberty, and menopause The use of birth control pills Postmenopausal hormone replacement A history of blood clots Conditions that cause increased pressure in the abdomen, such as tumors, constipation, and externally worn garments like girdles Other reported causes include trauma or injury to the skin, previous vein surgery, and exposure to ultraviolet rays. Spider veins twist and turn and look like a spider’s web or tree branch. They are usually red, purple, or blue and easily visible through the skin. They are most often found on the legs and face. (Photo Credit: Science Photo Library / Science Source) Other Risk Factors for Varicose Veins and Spider Veins Varicose veins and spider veins develop more often in women than in men. They increase in frequency with age. An estimated 30% to 60% of adults have varicose veins or spider veins. Symptoms of Varicose Veins and Spider Veins Many people with varicose veins complain of pain, described as an aching or cramping in the legs. Other common symptoms include tiredness, restlessness, burning, throbbing, tingling, or heaviness in the legs. Pain from these veins is usually relieved by elevating the legs or by wearing support hose, also called compression stockings. In women, symptoms may be worse during certain parts of the menstrual cycle or during pregnancy. Less common is swelling, ulcers, and a darkening of the skin, especially in the ankle region. Occasionally, varicose veins can form a painful blood clot with inflammation of the vein, a condition called thrombophlebitis. Telangiectasias are clusters of small, widened blood vessels which develop near the surface of the skin of mucous membranes. They are commonly known as spider veins. (Photo Credit: DermNet NZ) What Are the Treatment Options for Varicose Veins and Spider Veins? There are seven major treatments for varicose veins and spider veins: 1. Support (compression) stockings. The most conservative approach is simply to wear properly fitting support hose, especially when the veins cause pain or discomfort. They create gentle pressure in the leg. That keeps blood from pooling in veins and also helps with leg swelling. These stockings can generally be purchased at any surgical supply store and at some pharmacies. They come in below-the-knee, above-the-knee, and pantyhose styles. 2. Lifestyle changes. Good skin hygiene, weight loss (if needed), and walking can help treat varicose veins and spider veins. You can also try: Not standing or sitting for long periods without taking a break Not wearing high heels for long periods. Shoes with lower heels can help tone calf muscles and improve blood flow through the veins. Elevating your legs while sitting, resting, or sleeping -- ideally, to a level above your heart Not crossing your legs at your knees or ankles Physical activities that move your legs, which will improve muscle tone 3. Sclerotherapy. This procedure can eliminate the pain and discomfort of varicose veins and prevent complications, such as ulcers or vein bleeding. It may also be used simply to improve appearance. Sclerotherapy uses a highly concentrated saline (salt) solution or a specially made detergent that is injected directly into the vein. The chemical irritates and scars the inside of the vein, making it collapse and causing the vein to disappear gradually over 3 to 6 weeks. It could take 6 months for larger veins to disappear. During sclerotherapy treatments, you may feel small needle pricks as your doctor injects the veins. You can also experience temporary muscle cramping. Afterward, you’ll need to wear medical-grade compression stockings for a few weeks. The procedure is simple, relatively inexpensive, and can be performed in an outpatient setting. 4. Endovenous laser ablation is a procedure in which a small laser fiber is inserted into the vein. Your doctor will make a tiny cut near the vein and put in a small catheter. A device at the tip of the catheter heats up the inside of the vessel. Pulses of laser light are delivered inside the vein, which causes the vein to collapse. Endovenous ablation therapy is minimally invasive and generally safe and complication-free. There are, though, risks, including infection, damage to the blood vessel, inflammation of the vein, and, rarely, heat damage to nerves, although this typically goes away in a short time. In extremely rare cases, blood clots that form in the veins can travel to the lungs. The procedure is done as an outpatient under local anesthesia. 5. Radiofrequency occlusion . A small catheter is inserted into the vein. The catheter delivers radiofrequency energy to the vein wall, causing it to heat, collapse, and seal shut. The procedure is generally done in an outpatient or office setting, sometimes under local anesthesia. 6. Surgery. Surgical techniques to treat varicose veins include ligation (tying off of a vein) and stripping (removal of a long segment of vein).  Traditional vein stripping and ligation involves tying veins shut and removing them through small cuts in your skin. The surgery takes 2-3 hours and is usually done in an outpatient setting. Full recovery takes 1-2 weeks. Although vein stripping and ligation is generally safe, risks include infection at the incision site, bruising, or irritation of a nerve that runs by the veins that are stripped. In endoscopic vein surgery, your doctor will make a small cut in your skin near the vein and use a tiny camera at the end of a thin tube to move through the vein. Then they will use a surgical device at the camera’s end to close the vein. Another procedure, ambulatory phlebectomy, allows for the removal of large surface veins through very small incisions that do not need stitches . Surgery may be performed using local, spinal, or general anesthesia. Most patients return home the same day as the procedure. First, the doctor will outline or mark the vein to be removed, then inject local anesthesia into the skin. They will make a tiny cut and use a surgical instrument or a large needle to hook the vein through the opening. Next, they will remove the vein segment by segment. Afterward, you’ll need to wear compression stockings for at least 1 week. An enhanced version called transilluminated power phlebectomy involves fewer cuts and less pain, bleeding, and scarring. Your doctor will insert a fiber optic light under your skin while at the same time injecting a saline and local anesthetic mixture. This makes a silhouette of the veins to guide placement of an instrument that cuts the vein into small pieces and suctions them out. Surgery is generally used to treat large varicose veins, ones that become severe enough to cause skin ulcers or sores. 7. Lasers and intense pulsed light. Surface laser or intense pulsed light treatments, such as Vasculight and PhotoDerm, are other options. These devices use heat energy to selectively damage or destroy abnormal veins. An advantage of these treatments is that no needles or sclerosing solutions are required; however, there may be some minor discomfort. Side effects do occur, including discoloration or staining and blister formation. For varicose veins to be treated successfully, several sessions may be required, usually at 6-week intervals. Laser therapy is most effective for small varicose veins and spider veins, but lasers are also used in endovenous ablation therapy to treat larger varicose veins. Doctors may also use laser therapy as an additional treatment after sclerotherapy, endovenous therapy, or surgery for larger varicose veins. Intense pulsed light therapy (IPL) uses high-intensity pulsed light to shrink certain sizes of varicose veins and small spider veins. IPL differs from laser therapy, which uses a single emitted wavelength, by emitting a spectrum of light.  IPL may help when sclerotherapy or laser therapy don’t work. Not everybody with varicose or spider veins has pain or other symptoms. They might want the veins removed, however, for cosmetic reasons. Insurance Coverage for Varicose Vein and Spider Vein Treatment Many insurance companies cover the cost of treating varicose veins, but generally not spider veins. The best approach is to check with your insurance company before considering treatment options."
63,What Is Batten Disease?,"Batten disease is a rare group of nervous system disorders called neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCLs) (or ceroid lipofuscinosis, neuronal: CLN) that get worse over time. It usually starts in childhood, between the ages of 5 and 10 (unless the child has the infantile or late infantile form and symptoms then usually develop before the age of 1). There are different forms of the disease but all are fatal, usually by the late teens or twenties (Children with the disease have a shortened life expectancy and the increased risk for early death depends on the form of the disease and the age of onset of the disease). The damage is caused by the buildup of fatty substances, called lipopigments, in the cells of the brain , central nervous system , and retina in the eye . Out of every 100,000 babies born in the United States, it’s estimated that about two to four have this disease that’s passed down through families. Since it’s genetic, it can affect more than one person in the same family. Both parents have to be carriers of the gene in order to pass it down. Each one of their children has a one in four chance of getting it. Symptoms Over time, Batten disease damages the brain and nervous system . There are four main types of this condition. These are their common symptoms: Seizures Changes in personality and behavior Dementia Speech and motor skills problems that get worse over time There are four major types of Batten disease. The type will determine the age when symptoms occur and how fast they develop. There is no cure for these disorders but a treatment for one of the forms (CLN2 disease) has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2017 (See below). The Types Originally, doctors only referred to one form of NCL as Batten disease, but now the name refers to the group of disorders. Of the four major types, the three that affect children all cause blindness. Congenital NCL affects babies and can cause them to be born with seizures and abnormally small heads ( microcephaly ). It’s very rare, and often results in death soon after a baby is born. Infantile NCL (INCL) (CLN1) usually shows up between the ages of 6 months and 2 years, (but usually before age 1). It also can cause microcephaly, as well as sharp contractions (jerks) in the muscles. Most children with INCL die in early to mid-childhood).  (There is also a juvenile onset of CLN1, abnormalities develop around age 5/6 and disease progression is slower.  Affected children may live into their teenage years or even into adulthood if they develop the symptoms in the adolescence period). Late Infantile NCL (LINCL) (CLN2) typically starts between the ages of 2 and 4 with symptoms like seizures and gradually lose the ability to walk and speak.  LINCL is usually fatal by the time a child is 8 to 12 years old. There is no specific treatment that can cure or reverse the symptoms of any form of Batten disease but in 2017 the Food and Drug Administration approved an enzyme replacement therapy for CLN2 disease (TTP1 deficiency) called cerliponase alfa (Brineura). Brineura is a prescription medication used to slow loss of ability to walk or crawl (ambulation) in symptomatic pediatric patients 3 years of age and older with late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 2 (CLN2).  Brineura is administered into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by infusion via a specific surgically implanted reservoir and catheter in the head (intraventricular access device).  There are no treatments that can slow or stop disease progression for other NCL disorders. CLN3 disease: Juvenile onset (ages 4-7). Progressive vision loss begins between 4-7 yrs old.  Learning and behavioral problem occur, there is cognitive decline and patients can start having seizures around age 10.  Seizures may be controlled or reduced with antiseizure medications.  Children in their teenage years develop Parkinsonism like symptoms.  Medicines are available to treat some of the parkinsonism symptoms (stiffness and difficulty with walking/doing tasks), and spasticity (muscle stiffness).   Most die between the age of 15-30. Adult NCL (ANCL) (CLN4 or Kufs disease type B) starts before the age of 40 (early adulthood). These patients have problems with movement and early dementia.   People who have it have shorter life spans, but the age of death can vary from person to person. The symptoms of ANCL are milder and they tend to progress more slowly. This form of the disease does not result in blindness. Diagnosis and Tests Batten disease is often misdiagnosed, because it’s rare and many conditions share some of the same symptoms. Since vision loss is usually one of the earliest signs of the disease, eye doctors can be the first ones to suspect a problem. Multiple exams and tests might be needed before your doctor makes a diagnosis. Doctors often refer children to neurologists if they think they need more tests. There are different kinds of tests a neurologist can use to diagnose Batten disease: Tissue samples or eye exam : By examining tissue samples under a microscope, doctors can look for the buildup of certain kinds of deposits. Sometimes doctors can see these deposits just by looking into a child’s eyes . As the deposits build up over time, they can cause pink and orange circles to develop. This is called a “bull’s eye .” Blood or urine tests : Doctors can look for certain kinds of abnormalities in blood and urine samples that can indicate Batten disease. Electroencephalogram (EEG): This is a test that involves putting patches on the scalp to record the brain ’s electrical currents and look for seizures. Imaging tests : CT (computed tomography) scans or MRIs ( magnetic resonance imaging ) can help a doctor see if there are certain changes in the brain that indicate Batten disease. DNA test : If you know members of your family have Batten disease, you can get a DNA test to confirm a diagnosis. Treatment There’s currently no known cure for any form of Batten disease, but the FDA approved an enzyme replacement therapy for CLN2 disease (TTP1 deficiency) called cerliponase alfa (Brineura) for one of the forms (CLN2 disease) in 2017. Symptoms like seizures can be improved with certain medications. Other symptoms and issues can be treated, too, with therapy and medications. Some people with Batten disease get physical or occupational therapy to help them function. Scientists continue to research possible treatments and therapies."
64,What Is Spina Bifida?,"Spina bifida is a relatively common birth defect in the U.S. that affects the spine. The words literally mean ""split spine"" in Latin. If a baby has the condition, during development, the neural tube (a group of cells that form the brain and the spinal cord of a baby) doesn't close all the way, so the backbone that protects the spine doesn't form completely. This can cause physical issues. About 1,500 to 2,000 babies of the 4 million born in the U.S. every year have spina bifida. Thanks to advances in medicine, 90% of babies who have this defect live to be adults, and most go on to lead full lives. Types There are three main types of spina bifida: Spina bifida occulta (SBO) : This is the most common and mildest form of the defect. Many people don't even know they have it. (""Occulta"" means ""hidden"" in Latin.) Here, the spinal cord and nerves are usually fine, but there might be a small gap in the spine . People often find out they have SBO when they get an X-ray for some other reason. This type of spina bifida doesn't typically cause any type of disability. Meningocele : This rare type of spina bifida happens when a sac of spinal fluid (but not the spinal cord) pushes through an opening in the baby's back. Some people have few or no symptoms, while others have problems with their bladder and bowels. Myelomeningocele : This is the most severe type of spina bifida. Here, the baby's spinal canal is open in one or several places in the lower or middle back, and a sac of fluid pokes out. This sac also holds part of the spinal cord and the nerves, and those parts get damaged. Symptoms With spina bifida occulta, the most obvious sign might be a tuft of hair or a birthmark at the site of the defect. With meningocele and myelomeningocele, you can see the sac poking through the infant’s back. In the case of meningocele, there may be a thin layer of skin over the sac. With myelomeningocele, there’s usually no skin covering, and the spinal cord tissue is out in the open. Other associated symptoms range from: Weak leg muscles (in some cases, the infant can’t move them at all) Unusually shaped feet , uneven hips, or a curved spine ( scoliosis ) Hydrocephalus (a buildup of cerebrospinal fluid in brain cavities), a condition which in infants can cause an enlarged head, a bulging soft spot on top of their head, and other symptoms. Seizures Bowel or bladder problems Children also might have trouble breathing , swallowing, or moving their upper arms. They also might be overweight . The symptoms depend a lot on where the problem is in the spine and which spinal nerves are involved. Causes No one knows for sure what causes spina bifida. Scientists think it may be a combination of the environment and family history, or a lack of folic acid (a type of vitamin B) in the mother's body. But we do know that the condition is more common among white and Hispanic babies and in girls. Also, women who have diabetes that isn’t managed well or who are obese may be more likely to have a child with spina bifida. Diagnosis Three tests can check for spina bifida and other birth defects while the baby is still in the womb: Blood test: A sample of the mother’s blood is tested to see if it has a certain protein the baby makes called AFP. If the level of AFP is very high, it could mean the baby has spina bifida or another neural tube defect. Ultrasound : High-frequency sound waves bounce off tissues in your body to make black-and-white pictures of the baby on a computer monitor. If your baby has spina bifida, you may see an open spine or a sac poking out of the spine. Amniocentesis: If the blood test shows a high level of AFP but the ultrasound looks normal, your doctor may recommend amniocentesis. This is when your doctor uses a needle to take a small amount of fluid from the amniotic sac around the baby. If there’s a high level of AFP in that fluid, that means the skin around the baby's sac is missing and AFP has leaked into the amniotic sac. Sometimes, spina bifida is diagnosed after a baby is born -- usually if the mother didn’t get prenatal care or the ultrasound didn't show anything wrong. The doctor probably will want to get X-rays of the baby’s body and do a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, which uses strong magnets and radio waves to get more detailed images. Treatment Doctors can operate on babies when they’re just a few days old or even while they’re still in the womb. If the baby has meningocele, about 24 to 48 hours after birth, the surgeon will put the membrane around the spinal cord back in place and close the opening. If the baby has myelomeningocele, the surgeon will put the tissue and spinal cord back inside the baby's body and cover it with skin. If the baby has extra fluid on the brain (hydrocephalus), the surgeon will put a hollow tube into the baby’s brain called a shunt to redirect the fluid to another part of the body to be reabsorbed. This is also done 24 to 48 hours after the baby’s born. Surgery sometimes can be done while the baby is still in the womb. Before the 26th week of pregnancy, the surgeon goes into the mother's womb and sews shut the opening over the baby's spinal cord. Children who have this type of surgery seem to have fewer birth defects. But it’s risky to the mother and makes it more likely that the baby will be born too early. After these surgeries, others may be needed to correct problems with feet, hips, or the spine or to replace the shunt in the brain . Between 20% and 50% of children with myelomeningocele may also have something called progressive tethering, which is when their spinal cords get fastened to the spinal canal. (Normally, the bottom of the spinal cord floats freely in the spinal canal.) As the child grows, the spinal cord stretches, and that causes a loss of muscle and bowel or bladder problems. Surgery may be needed to fix that as well. Some people with spina bifida need crutches, braces, or wheelchairs to move around, and others need a catheter to help with their bladder issues. Working closely with your child's medical team ensures the best health and management for your child with this chronic medical condition. Prevention Studies have shown that taking a multivitamin with folic acid can prevent spina bifida and lower your baby’s odds of having this and other birth defects. Any woman who’s pregnant or trying to get pregnant should get 400 micrograms a day. If you have spina bifida, or have a child with spina bifida, you should get 4,000 micrograms per day at least 1 month before you get pregnant through the first few months. Folic acid is also in dark green vegetables, egg yolks, and some fortified breads, pastas, rice, and breakfast cereals."
65,Pain Management: Arachnoiditis,"The nerves of the brain and the spinal cord are protected by three surrounding membranes: the dura mater, arachnoid mater, and pia mater. Arachnoiditis is a pain disorder that develops when the arachnoid becomes inflamed. It is characterized by severe stinging, burning pain, and neurological problems. Symptoms of Arachnoiditis Symptoms of arachnoiditis can vary, but the most common is pain in the lower back or legs that is often described as burning or stinging pain. Others include: Weakness, numbness or tingling in the legs Pins and needles sensation (paresthesia) Joint pain Ringing in the ears (tinnitus) Fatigue Bladder problems As the disease progresses, symptoms may become more severe or even permanent. Many people with arachnoiditis are unable to work and suffer significant disability because they are in constant pain. Causes of Arachnoiditis Inflammation of the arachnoid can be triggered by a number of different irritants, including: Spinal cord injury: In most cases, it is related to complications from spinal surgery or procedure such as epidural injection and spinal tap. Infection: Viruses or bacteria such as bacterial meningitis of the spine can trigger the inflammation. Spinal nerve compression: Chronic degenerative disc disease or advanced spinal stenosis (narrowing of spinal column) can lead to compression of the spinal nerves, triggering inflammation of the arachnoid. Diagnosing Arachnoiditis Diagnosing arachnoiditis can be difficult, but tests such as the CAT scan (computerized axial tomography) or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) have helped with diagnosis. A test called an electromyogram (EMG) can assess the severity of the ongoing damage to affected nerve roots by using electrical impulses to check nerve function. Note: Myelograms with the radiographic contrast currently in use, combined with CAT scanning, are not considered to be responsible for causing arachnoiditis or causing it to worsen. Treating Arachnoiditis There is no cure for arachnoiditis. Treatment options for arachnoiditis are similar to those for other chronic pain conditions. Most treatments focus on relieving pain and improving symptoms that impair daily activities. Often, health care professionals recommend a program of pain management, physiotherapy, exercise, and psychotherapy . Surgery for arachnoiditis is controversial, because outcomes can be poor and provide only short-term relief. Clinical trials of steroid injections and electrical stimulation are needed to determine whether those treatments are effective."
66,Pain Management: Treatment Overview,"What Are the Treatments for Chronic Pain? The treatments for chronic pain are as diverse as the causes. From over-the-counter and prescription drugs to mind/body techniques to acupuncture, there are a lot of approaches. But when it comes to treating chronic pain, no single technique is guaranteed to produce complete pain relief. Relief may be found by using a combination of treatment options. Drug Therapy: Nonprescription and Prescription Milder forms of pain may be relieved by over-the-counter medications such as Tylenol (acetaminophen) or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen. Both acetaminophen and NSAIDs relieve pain caused by muscle aches and stiffness, and additionally NSAIDs reduce inflammation (swelling and irritation). Topical pain relievers are also available, such as creams, lotions, or sprays that are applied to the skin in order to relieve pain and inflammation from sore muscles and arthritis. If over-the-counter drugs do not provide relief, your doctor may prescribe stronger medications, such as muscle relaxants, anti-anxiety drugs (such as diazepam [Valium]), antidepressants (like duloxetine [Cymbalta] for musculoskeletal pain), prescription NSAIDs such as celecoxib (Celebrex), or a short course of stronger painkillers (such as codeine, fentanyl [Duragesic, Actiq], oxycodone and acetaminophen (Percocet, Roxicet, Tylox) or hydrocodone and acetaminophen (Lorcet, Lortab, and Vicodin). A limited number of steroid injections at the site of a joint problem can reduce swelling and inflammation. An epidural might be given for spinal stenosis or lower back pain. In July 2015, the FDA asked that both prescription and over-the-counter NSAIDs strengthen their warning labels to indicate the potential risk of heart attacks and strokes. The risk increases with higher doses of the drugs. In addition, there is also the possibility of developing bleeding stomach ulcers. Sometimes, a group of nerves that causes pain to a specific organ or body region can be blocked with local medication. The injection of this nerve-numbing substance is called a nerve block. Although many kinds of nerve blocks exist, this treatment cannot always be used. Often blocks are not possible, are too dangerous, or are not the best treatment for the problem. You doctor can advise you as to whether this treatment is appropriate for you. Patient-controlled analgesia ( PCA ) is another method of pain control. By pushing a button on a computerized pump, the patient is able to self-administer a premeasured dose of pain medicine infused with opioids. The pump is connected to a small tube that allows medicine to be injected intravenously (into a vein), subcutaneously (just under the skin), or into the spinal area. This is often used in the hospital to treat pain in post-traumatic or post-surgical pain as well as terminal cancer pain.. Trigger Point Injections Trigger point injection is a procedure used to treat painful areas of muscle that contain trigger points, or knots of muscle that form when muscles do not relax. During this procedure, a healthcare professional, using a small needle, injects a local anesthetic that sometimes includes a steroid into a trigger point (sterile salt water is sometimes injected). With the injection, the trigger point is made inactive and the pain is alleviated. Usually, a brief course of treatment will result in sustained relief. Trigger point injection is used to treat muscle pain in the arms, legs, lower back, and neck. In addition, this approach has been used to treat fibromyalgia, tension headaches, and myofascial pain syndrome (chronic pain involving tissue that surrounds muscle) that does not respond to other treatment. Onabotulinumtoxina (Botox) is a toxin that blocks signals from the nerves to the muscles. It can also be injected to alleviate chronic migraine headaches . The procedure involves multiple injections around the head and neck every 12 weeks and may alleviate pain for up to three months. Surgical Implants When standard medicines and physical therapy fail to offer adequate pain relief, you may be a candidate for a surgical implant to help you control pain. When they are used, which is rare, there are two main types of implants to control pain: Intrathecal Drug Delivery. Also called infusion pain pumps or spinal drug delivery systems. The surgeon makes a pocket under the skin that's large enough to hold a medicine pump. The pump is usually about one inch thick and three inches wide. The surgeon also inserts a catheter, which carries pain medicine from the pump to the intrathecal space around the spinal cord. The implants deliver medicines such as morphine or a muscle relaxant directly to the spinal cord , where pain signals travel. For this reason, intrathecal drug delivery can provide significant pain control with a fraction of the dose that would be required with pills. In addition, the system can cause fewer side effects than oral medications because less medicine is required to control pain. Spinal Cord Stimulation Implants. In spinal cord stimulation , low-level electrical signals are transmitted to the spinal cord or to specific nerves to block pain signals from reaching the brain. This method being especially used for back and limb pain. In this procedure, a device that delivers the electrical signals is surgically implanted in the body. A remote control is used by the patient to turn the current off and on or to adjust the intensity of the signals. Some devices cause what’s described as a pleasant, tingling sensation while others do not. Two kinds of spinal cord stimulation systems are available. Partial and totally implanted units. The unit that is more commonly used is fully implanted. The latter system's antenna and transmitter are carried outside the body, while the receiver is implanted inside the body TENS Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation therapy, more commonly referred to as TENS , uses electrical stimulation to diminish pain. During the procedure, low-voltage electrical current is delivered through electrodes that are placed on the skin near the source of pain. The electricity from the electrodes stimulates the nerves in an affected area and sends signals to the brain that ""scramble"" normal pain signals. TENS is not painful and may be effective therapy to mask pain such as diabetic neuropathy. However, TENS for chronic low back pain is not effective and cannot be recommended, says the American Academy of Neurology (AAN). Bioelectric Therapy Bioelectric therapy relieves pain by blocking pain messages to the brain. Bioelectric therapy also prompts the body to produce chemicals called endorphins (endorphins are also released by exercise) that decrease or eliminate painful sensations by blocking the message of pain from being delivered to the brain. Bioelectric therapy can be used to treat many chronic and acute conditions causing pain, such as back pain, muscle pain, headaches and migraines, arthritis, TMJ disorder , diabetic neuropathy, and scleroderma. Bioelectric therapy is effective in providing temporary pain control, but it should be used as part of a total pain management program. When used along with conventional pain-relieving medications, bioelectric treatment may allow pain sufferers to reduce their dose of some pain relievers by up to 50%. Physical Therapy Physical therapy helps to relieve pain by using special techniques that improve movement and function impaired by an injury or disability. Along with employing stretching, strengthening, and pain-relieving techniques, a physical therapist may use, among other things, TENS to aid treatment. Exercise Although resting for short periods can alleviate pain, too much rest may actually increase pain and put you at greater risk of injury when you again attempt movement. Research has shown that regular exercise can diminish pain in the long term by improving muscle tone, strength, and flexibility. Exercise may also cause a release of endorphins, the body's natural painkillers. Some exercises are easier for certain chronic pain sufferers to perform than others; try swimming, biking, walking, rowing, and yoga . Psychological Treatment When you are in pain, you may have feelings of anger, sadness, hopelessness, and/or despair. Pain can alter your personality, disrupt your sleep, and interfere with your work and relationships. In turn, depression and anxiety, lack of sleep, and feelings of stress can all make pain worse. Psychological treatment provides safe, nondrug methods that can treat your pain directly by reducing high levels of physiological stress that often aggravate pain. Psychological treatment also helps improve the indirect consequences of pain by helping you learn how to cope with the many problems associated with pain. A large part of psychological treatment for pain is education, helping patients acquire skills to manage a very difficult problem. Alternative Therapies In the past decade, many people have found relief for their pain in mind-body therapies, acupuncture, and some nutritional supplements. Others use massage , chiropractic and osteopathic (bone) manipulation therapies, therapeutic touch, certain herbal therapies, and dietary approaches to alleviate pain. However, there is little if any scientific evidence supporting these therapies for pain relief. Mind-Body Therapies Mind-body therapies are treatments that are meant to help the mind's ability to affect the functions and symptoms of the body. Mind-body therapies use various approaches including relaxation techniques, meditation, guided imagery, biofeedback, and hypnosis. Relaxation techniques can help alleviate discomfort related to chronic pain . Visualization may be another worthwhile pain-controlling technique. Try the following exercise: Close your eyes and try to call up a visual image of the pain, giving it shape, color, size, motion. Now try slowly altering this image, replacing it with a more harmonious, pleasing -- and smaller -- image. Another approach is to keep a diary of your pain episodes and the causative and corrective factors surrounding them. Review your diary regularly to explore avenues of possible change. Strive to view pain as part of life, not all of it. Electromyographic (EMG) biofeedback may alert you to the ways in which muscle tension is contributing to your pain and help you learn to control it. Hypnotherapy and self-hypnosis may help you block or transform pain through refocusing techniques. One self-hypnosis strategy, known as glove anesthesia, involves putting yourself in a trance, placing a hand over the painful area, imagining that the hand is relaxed, heavy, and numb, and envisioning these sensations as replacing other, painful feelings in the affected area. Relaxation techniques such as meditation or yoga have been shown to reduce stress-related pain when they are practiced regularly. The gentle stretching of yoga is particularly good for strengthening muscles without putting additional strain on the body. Acupuncture Acupuncture is thought to decrease pain by increasing the release of endorphins, chemicals that block pain. Many acu-points are near nerves. When stimulated, these nerves cause a dull ache or feeling of fullness in the muscle. The stimulated muscle sends a message to the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord), causing the release of endorphins that block the message of pain from being delivered to the brain. Acupuncture may be useful as an accompanying treatment for many pain-related conditions, including headache, low back pain, menstrual cramps, carpal tunnel syndrome, tennis elbow, fibromyalgia , osteoarthritis (especially of the knee), and myofascial pain. Acupuncture also may be an acceptable alternative to or may be included as part of a comprehensive pain management program. Chiropractic Treatment and Massage Chiropractic treatment is the most common nonsurgical treatment for back pain. Improvements of people undergoing chiropractic manipulations were noted in some trials. However, the treatment's effectiveness in treating chronic back and neck pain has not been supported by compelling evidence from the majority of clinical trials. Further studies are currently assessing the effectiveness of chiropractic care for pain management. Osteopathic doctors, those with a ""D.O."" after their names, are also trained in bone manipulation techniques similar to that of chiropractors . Massage is being increasingly used by people suffering from pain, mostly to manage chronic back and neck problems. Massage can reduce stress and relieve tension by enhancing blood flow. This treatment also can reduce the presence of substances that may generate and sustain pain. Available data suggest that massage therapy, like chiropractic manipulations, holds considerable promise for managing back pain . However, it is not possible to draw final conclusions regarding the effectiveness of massage to treat pain because of the shortcomings of available studies. Therapeutic Touch and Reiki Healing Therapeutic touch and reiki healing are thought to help activate the self-healing processes of an individual and therefore reduce pain. Although these so-called ""energy-based"" techniques do not require actual physical contact, they do involve close physical proximity between practitioner and patient. In the past few years, several reviews evaluated published studies on the efficacy of these healing approaches to ease pain and anxiety and improve health. Although several studies showed beneficial effects with no significant adverse side effects, the limitations of some of these studies make it difficult to draw definitive conclusions. Further studies are needed before these approaches for pain treatment can be recommended. Nutritional Supplements Dietary supplements, such as fish oils and SAMe, also show some evidence of benefit, although more research is needed. Herbal Remedies It has been difficult to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of herbs, though there are a few, such as white willow bark, devil’s claw, cat’s claw, ginger , and turmeric, that have some evidence supporting their use. If you decide to use herbal preparations to better manage your pain, tell your doctor: Some herbs may interact with drugs you are receiving for pain or other conditions and may harm your health. Dietary Approaches to Treating Pain Some people believe that changing dietary fat intake and/or eating plant foods that contain anti-inflammatory agents can help ease pain by limiting inflammation. A mostly raw vegetarian diet was found helpful for some people with fibromyalgia, but this study was not methodologically strong. One study of women with premenstrual symptoms suggested that a low-fat vegetarian diet was associated with decreased pain intensity and duration. Weight loss achieved by a combination of dietary changes and increased physical activity has been shown to be helpful for people suffering from osteoarthritis . Still, further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of dietary modifications as a pain treatment. Things to Consider Alternative therapies are not always benign. As mentioned, some herbal therapies can interact with other medications you may be taking. Always talk to your doctor before trying an alternative approach and be sure to tell all your doctors what alternative treatments you are using. Other Options: Pain Clinics Many people suffering from chronic pain are able to gain some measure of control over it by trying many of the above treatments on their own. But for some, no matter what treatment approach they try, they still suffer from debilitating pain. For them, pain clinics -- special care centers devoted exclusively to dealing with intractable pain -- may be the answer. Some pain clinics are associated with hospitals and others are private; in either case, both inpatient and outpatient treatment are usually available. Pain clinics generally employ a multidisciplinary approach, involving physicians, psychologists , and physical therapists. The patient as well should take an active role in their own treatment. The aim in many cases is not only to alleviate pain but also to teach the chronic sufferer how to come to terms with pain and function in spite of it. Various studies have shown as much as 50% improvement in pain reduction for chronic pain sufferers after visiting a pain clinic, and most people learn to cope better and can resume normal activities."
67,Meningitis,"What Is Meningitis? Meningitis is a rare infection that affects the delicate membranes -- called meninges -- that cover the brain and spinal cord. You or your children can catch it. Meningitis vs. encephalitis These two conditions are similar, and many symptoms overlap. While meningitis affects the covering of the brain and spinal cord, encephalitis affects the tissue of the brain itself. Types of Meningitis Bacterial meningitis This is an extremely serious illness. You or your child will need to get medical help right away. It can be life-threatening or lead to brain damage unless you get quick treatment. Several kinds of bacteria can cause bacterial meningitis. The most common ones in the U.S. are: Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) Neisseria meningitidis (meningococcus) Listeria monocytogenes (in older people, pregnant women, or those with immune system problems) A bacteria called Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) was a common cause of meningitis in babies and young children until the Hib vaccine became available for infants. There are also vaccines for Neisseria meningitidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Experts recommend that all children get them, as well as all adults who are at a higher risk for the disease. In many cases, bacterial meningitis starts when bacteria get into your bloodstream from your sinuses , ears , or throat. The bacteria travel through your bloodstream to your brain. The bacteria that cause meningitis can spread when people who are infected cough or sneeze . If you or your child has been around someone who has bacterial meningitis, ask your doctor what steps you should take to avoid catching it. Viral meningitis Viral meningitis is more common than the bacterial form and generally less serious, but this isn't always the case. Several viruses can trigger the disease. Among them are: Non-polio enteroviruses, including the one that causes hand, foot, and mouth disease Herpes simplex virus Varicella zoster, which also causes chickenpox and shingles Mumps virus Measles virus Arboviruses such as West Nile and Zika Epstein-Barr, which also causes mononucleosis HIV Flu viruses Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus Fungal meningitis Fungal meningitis is much less common than the bacterial or viral forms. Healthy people rarely get it. You’re more likely to get this form of meningitis if you have a problem with your immune system, such as AIDS . Among the fungi that cause it are: Cryptococcus , which is common everywhere in the world. Histoplasma, which is especially common in soil with lots of bird or bat poop. In the U.S., it's found mostly in eastern and central states. Blastomyces, which thrives in wet soil and decaying leaves. In the U.S., it's found mostly in midwestern, south-central, and southeastern states. Coccidioides, which is found in the soil in the southwestern U.S., Mexico, Central and South America, and some parts of Washington state. Parasitic meningitis Parasitic meningitis is also rare. It’s caused by parasites that usually affect animals. You can get it from eating animals such as snails, slugs, snakes, fish , or poultry that are infected by parasites or their eggs, or produce that contains parasite eggs. The risk is higher with raw or undercooked foods. You can’t pass on this type of meningitis to other people. One especially rare type of this is called eosinophilic meningitis, and it's linked to three specific parasites: Angiostrongylus cantonensis , also known as rat lungworm, is found in Southeast Asia, Pacific islands, the Caribbean, and Africa. Baylisascaris procyonis is a type of roundworm that affects raccoons. It can also infect other small animals, including dogs. Gnathostoma spinigerum is a parasitic worm found mostly in Asia, South and Central America, and some parts of Africa. Amoebic meningitis Amoebic meningitis is a rare but usually fatal infection by a single-celled bug called Naegleria fowleri . This amoeba lives in soil or warm, fresh water, but not salt water. People typically get it from swimming in water where the amoeba lives, not by drinking it. Amoebic meningitis isn’t contagious. Noninfectious meningitis Noninfectious meningitis is caused by diseases such as lupus or cancer , or it may happen if you’ve had a head injury , brain surgery, or take certain medications . It isn’t contagious. Chronic meningitis Chronic meningitis has similar symptoms as acute meningitis but develops over a couple of weeks. It results from infections with a fungus or the mycobacteria that cause tuberculosis . These organisms get into the tissue and fluid surrounding your brain to cause meningitis. Aseptic meningitis is a term doctors use when they can't find signs of bacteria in fluid from your brain and spine. That might mean your meningitis has another cause, such as a virus, or it might mean the bacteria making you sick is hard to grow in lab conditions. Meningitis Symptoms Meningitis can cause a rash that starts small and looks like pinpricks before spreading into red or purple splotches. It can be hard to spot if your skin tone is darker – check the palms of your hands and the soles of your feet. (Photo Credit: John Radcliffe Hospital/Science Source) Meningitis symptoms can develop within hours or days. The condition may look different in adults than it does in babies or children. Signs to watch for include: Confusion Fever Headache Numbness in your face Sensitivity to light Stiff neck so that you can’t lower your chin to your chest Upset stomach or vomiting Severe headache with nausea or vomiting A hard time concentrating Seizures Sleepiness or a hard time waking up Lack of appetite Lack of thirst What's the first sign of meningitis? In the early stages of meningitis, you might feel like you have the flu. Meningitis in babies In infants, meningitis symptoms may include: High fever Crying that’s constant and gets louder when you hold the baby Baby seems overly sleepy, sluggish, or inactive Stiff neck or body Bulge on the soft area on the top of the baby ’s head Poor ability to feed Crankiness Meningitis in children The symptoms of meningitis in children older than 2 are the same as they are in adults. Meningitis rash Meningococcal bacteria is the main cause of the signature meningitis rash. As the bacteria spread through your body, they damage blood vessels. The vessels start to leak blood, which pools into surrounding tissue and becomes visible on your skin. It may start as what's called a ""petechial"" rash, which looks like small, red pinpricks on your skin. You may find them in spots where clothes put pressure on the skin – the waistband, for instance. A ""purpuric"" rash looks like splotches of red or purple, more like bruising. A petechial rash can progress to this stage. It can be tough to spot the rash on darker skin. Check paler areas of the body, such as the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, tummy, roof of the mouth, and insides of eyelids. If you roll a clear drinking glass over the rash, it might disappear. If it does, it's a ""blanching"" rash. If it doesn't go away, it's a ""non-blanching"" rash. A meningitis rash may start as blanching but almost always will progress to non-blanching. You can have meningitis without developing the rash. But the rash is a sign of serious illness, and anyone with it needs immediate medical help. Risk Factors for Meningitis Anyone can get meningitis, but research shows that it's more common in these age groups: Children under 5 Teenagers and young adults aged 16-25 Adults older than 55 Meningitis is more of a danger for people with certain medical conditions, such as a damaged or missing spleen , long-term disease, or immune system disorders . Because certain germs that cause meningitis can spread easily, outbreaks are most likely to happen in places where people live close to each other. College students in dorms or military recruits in barracks can be more likely to catch the disease. So are people who travel to areas where meningitis is more common, such as parts of Africa. Meningitis and Pregnancy One type of germ that causes bacterial meningitis is listeria. If you're pregnant, you're 13 times more susceptible than the general population to infection by this bacteria. It can contaminate: Hot dogs Lunch meat Paté and other meat spreads Smoked seafood Unwashed raw fruits and vegetables Unpasteurized milk Unpasteurized soft cheeses, including f eta, queso blanco, queso fresco, Brie, queso panela, Camembert, and blue-veined cheeses A listeria infection can lead to meningitis. During pregnancy, it can cause early labor or may be fatal to your baby. That's why doctors recommend avoiding foods most often affected by listeria when you're pregnant. Meningitis Causes Meningitis almost always results from a bacterial or viral infection that begins somewhere else in your body, such as your ears , sinuses , or throat. Less common causes of meningitis include: Autoimmune disorders Cancer medications Syphilis Tuberculosis Is meningitis contagious? Meningitis isn't contagious. But some of the things that cause it are. Many things that cause bacterial and viral meningitis can be spread to other people. Meningitis Diagnosis Your doctor will ask about your medical history and do a physical exam , including checking your neck for stiffness and looking for a skin rash that might suggest a bacterial infection. Meningitis tests If your doctor suspects meningitis, you'll need tests to confirm the diagnosis. They might include: Blood tests to find bacteria CT or MRI scans of your head to find swelling or inflammation Spinal tap, in which a health care worker uses a needle to take fluid from around your spinal cord. It can tell what’s causing your meningitis. Treatment for Meningitis Your treatment will depend on the type of meningitis you have. Bacterial meningitis needs treatment with antibiotics right away. The doctor might give you a general or broad-spectrum antibiotic even before they’ve found the exact bacteria that caused your illness. Once they do, they’ll change to a drug that targets the specific bacteria they find with the spinal tap. You might also get corticosteroids to ease inflammation . Viral meningitis usually goes away on its own without treatment. Your doctor might tell you to stay in bed, drink plenty of fluids, and take over-the-counter pain medicines if you have a fever or aches. If a virus such as herpes or influenza caused your illness, you might take antiviral medication. Antifungal medications can treat fungal meningitis. You might need to spend time in the hospital if you're dehydrated or have severe symptoms. Complications of Meningitis Meningitis can cause severe complications in adults and children, especially if you delay treatment. Possible complications include: Seizures Brain damage or stroke Loss of hearing Memory problems Learning problems A hard time walking, or paralysis Kidney failure Shock Death Prevention of Meningitis You may be able to prevent meningitis by avoiding infection with the viruses or bacteria that cause it. These infections are passed to others when you cough, sneeze , kiss, or share toothbrushes , or eating utensils. Take these steps to prevent infections: Wash your hands often. Rinse well. Also, teach your kids to wash their hands often, especially after eating, using the toilet, or when they’re in public places. Don’t share items such as toothbrushes, eating utensils, or lipstick. Don’t share food items or drinks with other people. Cover your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze. Stay healthy. Eat a healthy diet , get plenty of exercise, and rest at night. If you’re pregnant, eat well-cooked food. Avoid foods made from unpasteurized milk and raw or undercooked meats, fish, and eggs. Get immunized. Follow your doctor’s advice on getting immunization shots for diseases that may cause meningitis, including flu and pneumonia vaccines. Meningitis Vaccines Some vaccines can help protect you from meningococcal illness, which is caused by bacteria. MenACWY vaccine, which the CDC recommends for all teens and preteens. One dose is given at the age of 11 or 12, followed by a booster at age 16. It's also recommended for adults at high risk. MenB vaccine is recommended for children 10 and older who are at increased risk MenABCWY vaccine is a combination of MenACWY and MenB. If you're planning to get the other two at the same time, you can get this vaccine instead. The pneumococcal and Hib vaccines protect against bacteria that can cause bacterial meningitis. The Bacille Calmette-Guerin vaccine protects you against tuberculosis, which can cause meningitis. But it isn't used much in the U.S. Takeaways When you have meningitis, the protective layers around your brain and spinal cord (meninges) become inflamed. Most cases are caused by viruses, but other causes include bacteria, fungi, parasites, or amoeba. Common symptoms include a stiff neck, headache, fever, nausea, and vomiting. If you think you might have meningitis, get immediate medical help. If you have bacterial meningitis, your symptoms could get worse rapidly. Meningitis FAQs Can you have meningitis without a fever? Fever is a common symptom, but not everyone with meningitis has a fever. Can a person survive meningitis? Most people survive most forms of meningitis. How well you do depends on the type you have and how quickly you receive treatment. Amoebic meningitis cases caused by Naegleria fowleri are often fatal, but these infections are also very rare. How long does meningitis last? If you have viral meningitis, your main symptoms may go away within a week. If you have bacterial or fungal meningitis, you may need more time to recover, weeks or even months. You also might have lingering effects."
68,Spinal Muscular Atrophy,"What Is Spinal Muscular Atrophy? Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) most often affects babies and children and makes it hard for them to use their muscles. When your child has SMA, there's a breakdown of the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. The brain stops sending messages that control muscle movement. When that happens, your child's muscles get weak and shrink, and children can have trouble controlling head movement, sitting without help, and even walking. In some cases, they can have trouble swallowing and breathing as the disease gets worse. There are different types of SMA, and how serious it is depends on which type your child has. There's no cure, but treatments can improve some symptoms and, in some cases, help your child live longer. Researchers are working to find new ways to fight the disease. Keep in mind that every child or adult who has SMA will have a different experience. No matter how much your child's movement is limited, the disease doesn't affect their intelligence in any way. They will still be able to make friends and socialize. Spinal Muscular Atrophy Symptoms Symptoms vary a lot, depending on the type of SMA: Type 0. This is the rarest and most severe form of SMA and develops while you’re still pregnant . Babies with this type of SMA move less in the womb and are born with joint problems, weak muscle tone, and weak muscles for breathing. They often do not survive due to breathing problems. Type 1. This is also a severe type of SMA. A child may not be able to support their head or sit without help. They may have floppy arms and legs and problems swallowing. The biggest concern is weakness in the muscles that control breathing. Most children with type 1 SMA don't live past age 2 because of breathing problems. Keep in touch with your medical team, family members, clergy, and others who can help give you the emotional support you need while your child fights this disease. Type 2. This affects children 6-18 months old. The symptoms range from moderate to severe and usually involve the legs more than the arms. Your child may be able to sit and walk or stand with help. Type 2 is also called chronic infantile SMA. Type 3. Symptoms for this type start when children are 2-17 years old. It's the mildest form of the disease. Your child will most likely be able to stand or walk without help but may have problems running, climbing stairs, or getting up from a chair. Later in life, they may need a wheelchair to get around. Type 3 is also called Kugelberg-Welander disease or juvenile SMA . Type 4. This form of SMA starts when you're an adult. You may have symptoms such as muscle weakness, twitching, or breathing problems. Usually, only your upper arms and legs are affected. You'll have the symptoms throughout your life, but you can keep moving and even get better with exercises that you'll practice with the help of a physical therapist. It's important to remember that there's a lot of variation in the way this type of SMA affects people. Many people, for instance, are able to keep working for many years. Ask your doctor about ways to meet with others who have the same condition and know what you're going through. Spinal Muscular Atrophy Causes SMA is a disease that's passed down through families. If your child has SMA, it's because they have two copies of a broken gene, one from each parent. When this happens, their body won't be able to make a specific kind of protein . Without it, the cells that control muscles die. If your child gets a faulty gene from just one of you, they won't get SMA but will be a carrier of the disease. When your child grows up, they could pass the broken gene to their own child. Spinal Muscular Atrophy Diagnosis SMA can be hard to diagnose because the symptoms may be similar to other conditions. To help figure out what's going on, your doctor may ask you: Has your baby missed any developmental milestones, such as holding their head up or rolling over? Does your child have trouble sitting or standing on their own? Have you seen your child have trouble breathing ? When did you first notice the symptoms? Has anyone in your family had similar symptoms? Your doctor may also order some tests that can help make a diagnosis. For example, they may take a blood sample from your child to check for missing or broken genes that can cause SMA. Your doctor could also order a blood test that checks for creatine kinase (CK). It’s an enzyme that leaks out of weakening muscles. High blood CK levels aren’t always harmful but do show possible muscle damage. Other tests rule out conditions that have similar symptoms: Nerve tests, such as an electromyogram (EMG). Your doctor puts small patches on your child's skin and sends electrical impulses through the nerves to see if they are sending messages to the muscles. CT. This is a powerful X-ray that makes detailed pictures of the inside of your child's body. MRI. This uses powerful magnets and radio waves to make pictures of organs and structures inside your child. Muscle tissue biopsy. In this test, the doctor removes muscle cells through a needle in the muscle or through a small cut in your child's skin. Questions for Your Doctor Have you treated others with this condition? What treatments do you recommend? Is there therapy that can help keep my child's muscles strong? What can I do to help my child become more independent? How can I get in touch with others who have family members with SMA? Spinal Muscular Atrophy Treatment The FDA has approved three medications to treat SMA: nusinersen (Spinraza), onasemnogene abeparvovec-xioi (Zolgensma) and risdiplam (Evrysdi). Both are forms of gene therapy that affect the genes involved in SMA. The SMN1 and SMN2 genes give your body instructions for making a protein that helps with controlling muscle movement. Nusinersen (Spinraza). This treatment adjusts the SMN2 gene and lets it make more protein. It's used for both children and adults with SMA. Your child's medical team will inject the drug into the fluid around their spinal cord. Including preparation and recovery time, this can take at least 2 hours and will need to be done several times, followed by another dose every 4 months. Studies show it helps about 40% of people who use it by making them stronger and slowing the disease. Onasemnogene abeparvovec-xioi (Zolgensma). This involves replacing the problem SMN1 gene. It's used for children under 2 years old. Your child's medical team will put a tiny tube called a catheter directly into a vein in their arm or hand (an IV). Then, they'll send a copy of the SMN gene through the tube into a specific group of motor neuron cells. This will need to be done only one time. In studies, onasemnogene abeparvovec-xioi helped children with SMA reach certain developmental milestones faster, like controlling their heads or sitting without support. Risdiplam (Evrysdi) . This treatment works to stop the SMN2 genes from disrupting the protein production,  allowing the protein to reach the nerve cells as needed. Your child takes it orally once a day after a meal. The dosage is determined by their weight.Clinical trials showed improved muscle function after 12 months in 41% of those taking it. Besides gene therapy, your doctor may suggest a few other ways to help manage symptoms: Breathing. With SMA, especially types 1 and 2, weak muscles keep air from moving easily in and out of the lungs. If this happens to your child, they may need a special mask or mouthpiece. For severe problems, your child may use a machine that helps them breathe. Swallowing and nutrition. When muscles in the mouth and throat are weak, babies and children with SMA can have a hard time sucking and swallowing . In that situation, your child may not get good nutrition and may have trouble growing. Your doctor may suggest working with a nutritionist. Some babies may need a feeding tube. Movement. Physical and occupational therapy, which use exercises and regular daily activities, can help protect your child's joints and keep muscles strong. A therapist may suggest leg braces, a walker, or an electric wheelchair. Special tools can control computers and phones and help with writing and drawing. Back issues. When SMA starts in childhood, children can get a curve in their spine . A doctor may suggest that your child wear a back brace while their spine is still growing. When they’ve stopped growing, they may have surgery to fix the problem. Caring for Your Child With Spinal Muscular Atrophy There's a lot you can do as a family to help your child with some of the basic tasks of daily life. A team of doctors, therapists, and support groups can help you with your child's care and let them keep up with friendships and activities with your family. Your child will probably need lifelong care from different types of doctors. They may need to see: Pulmonologists , doctors who treat lungs Neurologists, specialists in nerve problems Orthopedists, doctors who treat bone problems Gastroenterologists, specialists in stomach disorders Nutritionists, experts in the way food affects your child's health Physical therapists, people trained in using exercise to improve your child's motion This team can help you make decisions about your child's health. It's important not to let yourself get overwhelmed by the task of managing care. Check for support groups that can let you share your experiences with others who are in similar situations. Spinal Muscular Atrophy Outlook The outlook depends on when symptoms started and how severe they are. If your child has type 1 , a severe form of SMA, they may start having symptoms anywhere from birth to age 6 months. In general, most babies with this type start showing signs of the disease by age 3 months. You'll start to notice that their development is delayed, and they may not be able to sit up or crawl. Even though children with this type usually don't live beyond age 2, with help from your doctors and support team, you can make their life comfortable. In other types of SMA, doctors can help ease a child’s symptoms for many years and, in many cases, throughout their life . Keep in mind that every child or adult who has SMA will have a different experience. A treatment plan that's made just for your child can help them have a better quality of life. Spinal Muscular Atrophy Support Organizations like these can offer you support: Cure SMA. It funds research aimed at treating and curing SMA. Its SMArt Moves initiative focuses on the importance of early diagnosis and treatment. Cure SMA also offers support for people and families through local chapters and its website, including offering information to those newly diagnosed. Muscular Dystrophy Association. This group has information and links to services and support groups in your area. SMA Foundation. Its mission is to boost the search for SMA treatment, working with researchers, developing clinical trials , and helping to educate others about this genetic condition."
69,Spinal Stenosis,"What Is Spinal Stenosis? Spinal stenosis is a condition, mostly in adults 50 and older, in which your spinal canal starts to narrow. This can cause pain and other problems. Your spine is made up of a series of connected bones (or vertebrae) and shock-absorbing discs. It protects your spinal cord, a key part of the central nervous system that connects your brain to your body. The cord rests in the canal formed by your vertebrae. There are two different types of spinal stenosis. The type you have depends on where on your spine the condition is. Cervical stenosis is when the neck area of your spine is narrow. Lumbar stenosis is when the lower back area of your spine is narrow. You can have one or both types of spinal stenosis. Lumbar stenosis is the most common. For most people, stenosis results from changes caused by arthritis . As the spinal canal narrows, the open spaces between your vertebrae start to get smaller. The tightness can pinch the spinal cord or the nerves around it, causing pain , tingling, or numbness in your legs, arms, or torso. There’s no cure, but there are a variety of nonsurgical treatments and exercises to keep the pain at bay. Most people with spinal stenosis live normal lives. Spinal Stenosis Symptoms Spinal stenosis usually affects your neck or lower back. Not everyone has symptoms, but if you do, they tend to be the same: stiffness, numbness, and back pain . More specific symptoms include: Sciatica . These shooting pains down your leg start as an ache in the lower back or buttocks. Foot drop. Painful leg weakness may cause you to “slap” your foot on the ground. A hard time standing or walking. When you’re upright, it tends to compress the vertebrae, causing pain. Loss of bladder or bowel control. In extreme cases, it weakens the nerves to the bladder or bowel. Radiculopathy. Spinal stenosis that presses on the root of your spinal nerves can cause pain that radiates or shoots out from your spine, causing numbness, tingling, or weakness in your arms and legs. Myelopathy. When spinal stenosis squeezes your spinal cord, you may feel numbness, tingling, or weakness in your arms and legs. It can affect other parts of your body, like your bladder and bowel. Cauda equina syndrome . This is the section of nerves at the bottom of your spinal cord. If spinal stenosis compresses this part, you might lose feeling in your pelvic area, or have problems with incontinence . This can cause permanent nerve damage if you don’t treat it. This is a medical emergency. If you’re having symptoms, talk them over with your doctor. If you’re having a loss of bladder or bowel control, call your doctor at once. Spinal Stenosis Causes and Risk Factors The leading reason for spinal stenosis is arthritis, a condition caused by the breakdown of cartilage -- the cushiony material between your bones -- and the growth of bone tissue. Osteoarthritis can lead to disc changes, a thickening of the ligaments of the spine, and bone spurs. This can put pressure on your spinal cord and spinal nerves. Other causes include: Herniated discs. If these cushions are cracked, material can seep out and press on your spinal cord or nerves. Injuries. An accident may fracture or inflame part of your spine. Tumors. If cancerous growths touch the spinal cord, you may get stenosis. Paget’s disease. With this condition, your bones grow abnormally large and brittle. The result is a narrowing of the spinal canal and nerve problems. Thickened ligaments. When the cords that hold your bones together get stiff and thick, they can bulge into your spinal canal. Some people are born with spinal stenosis or diseases that lead to it. For them, the condition usually starts to cause problems between the ages of 30 and 50. Risks for spinal stenosis vary with age. For example: Wear and tear damage to the spine in adults over 50. Trauma, scoliosis , or genetic diseases in younger adults. Spinal Stenosis Diagnosis and Tests The doctor will ask questions about your medical history. After that, they might order at least one of the following tests to figure out whether you have the condition: Medical history review. Your doctor will ask about your health history and risk factors. X-rays. These can show how the shape of your vertebrae has changed. Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ). By using radio waves, an MRI creates a 3-D image of your spine. It can show tumors, growths, and even damage to discs and ligaments. Computerized tomography ( CT scan ). A CT scan uses X-rays to create a 3-D image. With the help of a dye injected into your body, it can show damage to soft tissue as well as issues with your bones. Spinal Stenosis Treatment The treatment you need for your spinal stenosis depends on where the stenosis is and how severe your symptoms are. You might need: Medication You might take: Over-the-counter pain treatment: Common pain remedies such as aspirin, acetaminophen ( Tylenol ), ibuprofen ( Advil , Motrin ), and naproxen can offer short-term relief. All are available in low doses without a prescription. Antidepressants : Taking tricyclic antidepressants, such as amitriptyline , can help ease chronic pain. Opioids : For short-term pain relief, your doctor might prescribe drugs with codeine, such as oxycodone ( Oxycontin , Roxicodone ) and hydrocodone ( Norco , Vicodin ). These drugs can be habit-forming and have serious side effects. Muscle relaxants: These can help control muscle spasms. Anti-seizure medication: You can take these to ease pain from damaged nerves. Corticosteroid injections: Your doctor will inject a steroid such as prednisone into your back or neck. Steroids make the inflammation go down. However, because of side effects, they are used sparingly. Anesthetics: Used with precision, an injection of a “ nerve block ” can stop pain for a time. Surgery If you have a severe case of spinal stenosis, you might struggle to walk or have issues with your bladder and bowels. Your doctor may recommend a type of surgery to create space between the bones so inflammation can go down. You might get: Laminectomy . This procedure removes the back part of the affected vertebrae. Laminoplasty. Your doctor puts metal hardware in your neck vertebrae to form a bridge in the open section of your spine. Laminotomy. The doctor removes a part of your vertebrae to relieve pressure. Minimally invasive surgery. This type of surgery helps avoid spinal fusion by removing bone in a way that reduces damage to nearby healthy tissue. Decompression procedure. The doctor uses needle-like instruments to remove part of the thickened ligaments in your spinal column. You only get this procedure if you have lumbar spinal stenosis caused by thickened ligaments. Surgery carries its own risks. Talk to your doctor about how much it can help, recovery time, and more before taking that step. Assistive Devices You might get braces, a corset, or a walker to help you move about. Spinal Stenosis Home Remedies Some things you can do to help ease symptoms of spinal stenosis include: Exercise. Think about moderation. Just take a 30-minute walk every other day. Talk over any new exercise plan with your doctor. Apply heat and cold. Heat loosens up your muscles. Cold helps heal inflammation. Use one or the other on your neck or lower back. Hot showers are also good. Practice good posture. Stand up straight, sit on a supportive chair, and sleep on a firm mattress. And when you lift heavy objects, bend from your knees, not your back. Lose weight. Extra pounds put added pressure on your back. Many patients also try nontraditional therapies, including chiropractic , acupuncture , and massage therapy . Again, be sure your doctor knows if you’re trying a nontraditional approach. Complications If you don’t treat your spinal stenosis, it can get worse over time. Certain symptoms may even become permanent, including: Numbness Weakness Problems with balance Loss of bladder and bowel control Paralysis"
70,Ataxia: What Are the Types?,"Ataxia is a movement disorder caused by problems in the brain . When you have ataxia, you have trouble moving parts of your body the way you want. Or the muscles in your arms and legs might move when you don’t want them to. The word ataxia actually means “without coordination.” Ataxia isn’t a disorder or a disease itself -- it’s a sign of other underlying disorders or diseases. Doctors have discovered anywhere from 50 to 100 different ataxias. They are grouped into categories based on what causes them, or based on which part of the body they affect. Types of Ataxia by Affected Area Ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) is rare genetic disease that affects the nervous system, the immune system, and many other parts of the body. Also known as Louis-Bar syndrome, dilated blood vessels and poor coordination are typical hallmarks of the condition. Small clusters of enlarged blood vessels called telangiectases can occur in the eyes and on the surface of the skin. People with A-T can easily develop lung infections and are at risk of developing cancers of the blood and immune system. Symptoms of A-T can appear in childhood and progress with age. Ataxia is caused by damage to different areas of the central nervous system. Doctors categorize it by the specific part of the brain most affected, including: Cerebellar ( brain ) Sensory (nerves) Vestibular ( ears ) Cerebellar Ataxia Your cerebellum is the part of your brain that’s in charge of balance and coordination. If part of your cerebellum starts to wear away, you can develop cerebellar ataxia. Sometimes it can also affect your spinal cord. It’s the most common form of ataxia. Symptoms of cerebellar ataxia include: Changes in your voice Dizziness Fatigue Headaches Muscle tremors Slurred speech Trouble walking Wide gait Sensory Ataxia Sensory ataxia is the result of damage to nerves in your spinal cord or your peripheral nervous system. That is the part of your nervous system outside of the brain and spinal cord. When you have sensory ataxia, you have less sensation in your feet and legs from the nerve damage , so you have less feedback from your brain telling you where your body is in relation to the ground. It’s also called proprioceptive ataxia. Symptoms of sensory ataxia include: Difficulty touching your finger to your nose with closed eyes Inability to sense vibrations Trouble walking in dim light Walking with a “heavy step,” or stomping when you walk Vestibular Ataxia Vestibular ataxia affects your vestibular system. This system is made up of your inner ear and ear canals, which contain fluid. They sense the movements of your head and help with your balance and spatial orientation. When the nerves in your vestibular system are affected, you can have the following problems: Blurred vision and other eye issues Nausea and vomiting Problems standing and sitting Staggering when you walk Trouble walking in a straight line Vertigo , or dizziness Causes of Ataxia Around 150,000 people in the U.S. deal with some form of ataxia. There are different causes for it. Some are genetic, some are acquired, like injuries, and some have no known clear cause. Genetic. You can inherit a certain mutated, or changed, gene from one or both of your parents that causes ataxia. Or you may inherit a mutated gene that causes a disorder with ataxia as a symptom. Some of the specific types of genetic ataxia include: Ataxia telangiectasia Ataxia with oculomotor apraxia Dominant spastic ataxias Dominant spinocerebellar ataxias ( SCA ) Episodic ataxia Friedreich's ataxia Recessive spastic ataxias Wilson’s disease Acquired. Acquired ataxia occurs when you have damage to your spinal cord or nerves. The damage might be from an injury or an illness. Some of the causes of acquired ataxia could include: Brain tumors Brain hemorrhage (bleeding) Cerebral palsy Chickenpox Hydrocephalus , or too much fluid buildup in the brain Head trauma Multiple sclerosis Reactions to certain cancers Vitamin E or B12 deficiency You can also get ataxia if you have a reaction to certain medications , from alcohol or drug use, or from exposure to poison. Idiopathic. When you haven’t inherited a mutated gene or had an illness or injury that could have caused your ataxia, it’s called idiopathic ataxia. Your doctor will diagnose you with idiopathic ataxia if they can’t find a medical reason for your ataxia symptoms. The most common idiopathic ataxia is called multiple system atrophy , or MSA. Doctors haven’t pinned down possible causes for this group of ataxias. They may come from a combination of environmental factors and genetic causes. Diagnosing Ataxia In order to diagnose your ataxia, your doctor will give you a physical exam . They’ll check your balance and coordination, hearing, vision , reflexes, and memory. You’ll also need a neurological exam, which might include an MRI or CT scan . These look at the structure of your brain for problems. For some cases, your doctor may recommend tests of your spinal fluid. To do this, they’ll insert a needle into your lower back and draw out the fluid to send it to a lab for testing. To rule out genetic forms of ataxia, you may need genetic testing . But, not all genetic forms of ataxia have tests to find them. Treating Ataxia The best treatment for your ataxia symptoms depends on the type you have. There is no specific treatment for ataxia itself. If your ataxia is a symptom of another disorder, your doctor will treat that disorder. If it’s due to a cause that you can avoid, like lack of vitamins or exposure to poison, your doctor will help you address the problem causing the ataxia. In order to help you cope with your symptoms, your doctor may recommend: Counseling Physical or occupational therapy Speech therapy Support groups Your doctor can also help you find tools so you can move around easier, such as a cane or a walker. There are also utensils to help you eat and speak more easily. Learn more about qualifying for disability for ataxia ."
71,Pain Management: Alternative Therapy,"The term ''alternative therapy'' generally is used to describe any medical treatment or intervention that is used in place of conventional medicine. When alternative therapies are used in conjunction with conventional medicine, it is called complementary medicine . Alternative therapy encompasses a variety of disciplines, including acupuncture , guided imagery, chiropractic treatment, yoga , hypnosis, biofeedback , aromatherapy, relaxation, herbal remedies, massage , and many others. In the past decade, strong evidence has been gathered for the benefits of mind-body therapies, acupuncture , and some nutritional supplements for treating pain . Other alternative therapies such as massage, chiropractic therapies, therapeutic touch, certain herbal therapies, and dietary approaches have the potential to alleviate pain in some cases. More research is needed to see how these therapies compare to conventional treatments. Mind-Body Therapies Mind-body therapies are treatments that are meant to help the mind’s ability to affect the functions and symptoms of the body. Mind-body therapies use various approaches, including relaxation techniques, meditation, guided imagery, biofeedback, and hypnosis. Relaxation techniques can help alleviate discomfort related to chronic pain . Visualization, also known as guided visualization, may be another worthwhile pain-controlling technique. Try the following exercise: Close your eyes and try to call up a visual image of the pain, giving it shape, color, size, motion. Now try slowly altering this image, replacing it with a more harmonious, pleasing -- and smaller -- image. Another approach is to keep a diary of your pain episodes and the causative and corrective factors surrounding them. Review your diary regularly to explore avenues of possible change. Strive to view pain as part of life, not all of it. Electromyographic (EMG) biofeedback may alert you to the ways in which muscle tension is contributing to your pain and help you learn to control it. Hypnotherapy and self-hypnosis may help you block or transform pain through refocusing techniques. One self-hypnosis strategy, known as glove anesthesia, involves putting yourself in a trance, placing a hand over the painful area, imagining that the hand is relaxed, heavy, and numb, and envisioning these sensations as replacing other, painful feelings in the affected area. Relaxation techniques such as meditation or yoga have been shown to reduce stress-related pain when they are practiced regularly. The gentle stretching of yoga is particularly good for strengthening muscles without putting additional strain on the body. Acupuncture Although the World Health Organization currently recognizes more than 30 diseases or conditions that can be helped by acupuncture treatment, one of the main uses of acupuncture is for pain relief. Sixteenth-century Chinese doctors believed that illness was due to an imbalance of energy in the body. In acupuncture, disposable, stainless steel needles are used to stimulate the body's 14 major meridians, or energy-carrying channels, to resist or overcome illnesses and conditions by correcting these imbalances. Acupuncture is also thought to decrease pain by increasing the release of chemicals that block pain, called endorphins. Many acu-points are near nerves. When stimulated, these nerves cause a dull ache or feeling of fullness in the muscle. The stimulated muscle sends a message to the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord), causing the release of endorphins ( morphine -like chemicals produced in our own bodies during times of pain or stress). Endorphins, along with other neurotransmitters (body chemicals that modify nerve impulses), block the message of pain from being delivered up to the brain . Acupuncture may be useful as an accompanying treatment for many pain-related conditions, including: headache, low back pain, menstrual cramps , carpal tunnel syndrome, tennis elbow , fibromyalgia, osteoarthritis and myofascial pain. Acupuncture also may be an acceptable alternative to or may be included as part of a comprehensive pain management program. Chiropractic Treatment and Massage Chiropractic treatment is the most common nonsurgical treatment for back pain. Improvements in people undergoing chiropractic manipulations were noted in some trials. However, the treatment's effectiveness in treating chronic back and neck pain isn’t supported by compelling evidence from the majority of clinical trials . Further studies are currently assessing the effectiveness of chiropractic care for pain management . Research also suggests that chiropractic treatments may be helpful for headaches, neck pain , certain arm and leg conditions, and whiplash . Serious complications such as stroke, pinched nerves, and worsening of herniated discs have been rarely reported. Massage is being increasingly used by people suffering from pain, mostly to manage chronic back and neck problems. Massage can reduce stress and relieve tension by enhancing blood flow. This treatment also can reduce the presence of substances that may generate and sustain pain. Available data suggest that massage therapy, like chiropractic manipulations, holds considerable promise for managing back pain. But it’s not possible to draw final conclusions regarding the effectiveness of massage to treat pain because of the shortcomings of available studies. Therapeutic Touch and Reiki Healing Therapeutic touch and reiki healing are thought to help activate the self-healing processes of an individual and therefore reduce pain. Although these so called ""energy-based"" techniques do not require actual physical contact, they do involve close physical proximity between practitioner and patient. In the past few years, several reviews evaluated published studies on the efficacy of these healing approaches to ease pain and anxiety and improve health. Although a few small studies showed these techniques are beneficial and have no significant adverse side effects, the limitations of some of these studies make it difficult to draw definitive conclusions. Further studies are needed before the evidence-based recommendation for using these approaches for pain treatment can be made. Dietary Approaches to Treating Pain Some people believe that changing dietary fat intake and/or consuming plant foods that contain anti-inflammatory agents can help ease pain by limiting inflammation . A mostly raw vegetarian diet was found helpful for some people with fibromyalgia, but this study was not randomized and was without a control group. One study of women with premenstrual symptoms suggested that a low-fat vegetarian diet was associated with decreased pain intensity and duration. Weight loss achieved by a combination of dietary changes and increased physical activity has been shown to be helpful for people suffering from osteoarthritis. Still, further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of dietary modifications as a pain treatment. Nutritional Supplements There is some evidence indicating that glucosamine sulfate and chondroitin sulfate may be marginally effective for knee osteoarthritis , but other studies have found no benefit at all. These natural compounds were found to be well-tolerated and safe. Other dietary supplements , such as fish oils, also showed some early evidence of benefit, although more research is needed. Herbal Remedies It has been difficult to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of herbs. If you decide to use herbal preparations to better manage your pain, it is of critical importance to share this information with your doctor. Some herbs may interact with drugs you are receiving for pain or other conditions and may harm your health. Things to Consider Alternative therapies are not always benign. As mentioned, some herbal therapies can interact with other medications you may be taking. Always talk to your doctor before trying an alternative approach and be sure to tell all your doctors what alternative treatments you are using."
72,Polycythemia Vera,"What Is Polycythemia Vera? Polycythemia vera (PV) is a blood cancer that begins in the marrow of your bones, the soft center where new blood cells grow. It causes your marrow to make too many red blood cells so your blood is too thick. You may be more likely to have clots, a stroke , or a heart attack . This disease gets worse slowly, usually over many years. It can be life-threatening if you don't get treatment, but the right care can help you live a long life. Most people who have PV don’t get diagnosed until they’re 60 or older, usually after a routine blood test. But it can happen at any age. Men get it more often than women. It's common to worry when you find out that you have cancer . Remember that everyone is different and that all cancers aren’t the same. With the support of your doctor, family, friends, and other people who have polycythemia vera, you’ll be in the best position to manage it. Polycythemia Vera Causes Your bone marrow makes three types of blood cells : Red White Platelets Red blood cells carry oxygen, white ones fight infections, and platelets clot your blood to stop bleeding. Most people with polycythemia vera have too many red blood cells. But it can also cause you to have too many white blood cells and platelets. PV is caused by a gene (either JAK2 or TET2) that doesn’t work the way it should. Most likely, the problem happened over the course of your life. Rarely, parents can pass these faulty genes to children. Polycythemia Vera Symptoms At first, you may not notice any problems. When they do show up, polycythemia vera symptoms can include: Headaches Double vision Dark or blind spots in your vision that come and go Itching all over your body, especially after you've been in warm or hot water Sweating , especially at night A red face that looks like sunburn or blushing Weakness Dizziness Weight loss Shortness of breath Tingling or burning in your hands or feet Painful joint swelling You may also feel pressure or fullness below your ribs on your left side. This might mean PV has enlarged your spleen , an organ that helps filter your blood. Polycythemia Vera Complications Blood clots can cause a heart attack, a stroke , or deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ). They might also make your liver or spleen larger. If your organs don’t get enough blood, you could have chest pain or heart failure . Having too many red blood cells might cause stomach ulcers , gout , or kidney stones . PV can also lead to more serious blood diseases like acute leukemia or myelofibrosis. Acute leukemia is a blood cancer that gets worse quickly. Myelofibrosis is a condition in which your bone marrow fills with scar tissue. Polycythemia Vera Diagnosis Your doctor will start with a physical exam , including a check of your spleen. They’ll ask about your symptoms and see if your face is unusually red. You may have some blood tests, including: Complete blood count( CBC ). Your doctor takes a sample of your blood and sends it to a lab, where a machine counts the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. An unusually high number of any of these could be a sign of polycythemia vera. Blood smear. Your doctor looks at a sample of your blood through a microscope. It's a way to check for other diseases that are sometimes linked to PV. EPO level. This test measures how much of the hormone EPO is in your blood. EPO tells your bone marrow to make blood cells. People who have polycythemia vera have very low amounts of it. You may also need a bone marrow biopsy . The results can show your doctor if your bone marrow makes too many blood cells. For this test, your doctor will take samples of your marrow, usually from the back of your hip bone . You lie down on a table and get a shot that will numb the area. Then, your doctor uses a needle to take out a small amount of bone marrow. It's an outpatient procedure, which means you don't have to stay overnight in a hospital. You can get it done in a clinic, a hospital, or your doctor's office. Questions for your doctor Before your appointment, it's a good idea to make a list of things to ask your doctor, such as: Which treatment do you recommend? What are the side effects? How can I prevent complications? Since I have polycythemia vera, am I more likely to have a stroke or heart attack? How can I ease my symptoms? Polycythemia Vera Treatment If you don't have many symptoms, you might not need treatment for PV right away. Your doctor will keep a close watch on you. If you do need treatment, it will be aimed at lowering the amount of red blood cells your body makes and preventing blood clots and other complications. Your options include: Phlebotomy . This is often the first treatment for people who have polycythemia vera. Your doctor takes blood from your vein so you have fewer blood cells. It's a lot like donating blood. After it's done, your blood will be thinner, and it’ll flow more easily. You'll usually feel better, too. Some symptoms will ease, like headaches or dizziness. Your doctor will decide how often you need phlebotomy. Some people with PV don’t need any other treatment for many years. Low-dose aspirin . This keeps platelets from sticking together. That makes you less likely to get blood clots, which in turn makes heart attacks or strokes less likely. Most people with polycythemia vera take low-dose aspirin. Medicine to lower blood cells. If you need more help, your doctor may prescribe hydroxyurea ( Droxia , Hydrea ), a pill that lowers your red blood count and eases symptoms. Other drugs like interferon alfa ( Intron A) or ropeginterferon alfa-2b-njft ( Besremi ) help your immune system cut back on making blood cells. You might take busulfan ( Busulfex , Myleran ) or ruxolitinib ( Jakafi ) if hydroxyurea isn’t helpful or if it causes severe side effects. If you have itching that doesn't go away, your doctor may give you antihistamines . Lifestyle Changes Keep yourself comfortable and as healthy as possible during treatment: Don't smoke or chew tobacco . Tobacco narrows blood vessels, which can make blood clots more likely. Get light exercise , such as walking, to help your circulation and keep your heart healthy. Do leg and ankle exercises to keep clots from forming in the veins of your legs. Your doctor or a physical therapist can show you how. Bathe or shower in cool water if warm water makes you itch. Keep your skin moist with lotion, and try not to scratch. Polycythemia Vera Prognosis There's no cure, but the right treatment can help you manage this disease for many years. Talk to your friends and family about what you’re dealing with. You may also want to join a support group for people who’ve been in your position. The MPN Research Foundation has more information about polycythemia vera. It can also help you find support groups."
73,What Is Felty's Syndrome?,"Some people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) get a rare disorder known as Felty's Syndrome (FS). It causes an enlarged spleen and a very low white blood count. It can be painful and lead to serious infections in some cases. Less than 3% of people with RA develop FS, but those in their 50s, 60s, and 70s who've had RA for 10 years or longer are more likely to have it. It's also three times more common in women than men. Children rarely get FS. Cause Doctors aren't sure what causes FS. Your white blood cells may have stopped fighting infections like they should. Or your bone marrow could be making abnormal white blood cells. Another theory is that your immune system attacks your white blood cells by mistake. FS doesn't always run in families, but some genes that raise your chances of getting it could be passed down to you. Symptoms Signs of FS are similar to those of rheumatoid arthritis. They also overlap other autoimmune diseases -- a disease in which your immune system attacks your own healthy cells -- like lupus . Because of that, FS can be hard to diagnose. You may have: Anemia (not enough healthy red blood cells to move oxygen through your body) Burning eyes or discharge from them Fatigue Fever Loss of appetite or weight loss Pale skin Repeat infections or infections that take a long time to clear up, especially in your lungs , urinary tract, or blood Sores or brown spots on your legs Stiff, swollen, or painful joints, usually in your hands, feet , or arms You also will have a swollen spleen -- a fist-sized organ behind your left ribs. It controls the amount of white blood cells in your body and plays a key part in your immune system . If your spleen is bigger than normal, you may feel pain behind your left rib cage. You also may feel full soon after you eat because it's pressing against your stomach . Other times, an enlarged spleen doesn't cause any symptoms. Diagnosis If your doctor thinks you might have FS, they'll feel around your stomach to see if your spleen is enlarged. An imaging test may be needed to confirm it: MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): Powerful magnets and radio waves are used to make detailed images. CT scan (computerized tomography): Several X-rays taken from different angles are put together to show a more complete picture. Your doctor will also have you take a blood test. People with FS have very low levels of special white blood cells called neutrophils. These are important for fighting off bacterial infections . Treatment If your RA is under control, you may not need treatment for FS. If you do need help with your symptoms, there are ways to manage them: Drugs that slow down the disease: low-dose methotrexate ( Otrexup , Rheumatrex , Trexall ) is often used to stop your FS from getting worse. It can cause some side effects, such as nausea and mouth ulcers . You'll also need regular tests to make sure MTX isn't hurting your liver . Other drugs your doctor might advise you to take include glucocorticoids or disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) that are used to treat RA, such as abatacept ( Orencia ) and leflunomide ( Arava ). Drugs that affect your immune system : Rituximab ( Rituxan ) is also a preferred treatment for FS and can shut off the part of your immune system that isn't working as it should. They're given by IV but may take up to a few weeks to work. Drugs that stimulate your white blood cells: Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) can help increase the number of white blood cells and help fight infection. Home care: Your doctor will tell you how much physical activity and rest you need. A heating pad may help with mild aches and pains. A nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) such as ibuprofen can also help. Surgery: If your FS is severe and other treatments don't work, your doctor may recommend that your spleen be taken out. This could return your red and white blood cells to normal levels and may lower your risk of infection for an indefinite amount of time."
74,Casts: Tips for Care and Comfort,"If you need a cast for a broken arm, to mend after knee surgery, or for another injury, you may wear it for several weeks or months. The cast keeps your bone or joint from moving so it can heal. But it also can cause discomfort and problems, from an annoying itch to a serious infection. Types of Casts You’ll likely get one of two main kinds of casts. Both are hard, and both go on top of a layer of cotton or other soft padding that rests on your skin. Plaster cast . This is made of plaster of Paris, a white powder that, when mixed with water, turns into a thick paste that hardens. Take care not to get your cast wet. It can start to dissolve or irritate your skin. Take baths instead of showers. Cover the cast with a plastic bag or a sleeve sold in drugstores. If it gets wet, dry it with a blow-dryer on a cool setting, or suck air through the cast with a vacuum cleaner hose. Fiberglass cast . Also called a synthetic cast, it's made of fiberglass, which is a type of plastic that can be shaped. It’s lighter and more durable and expensive than plaster casts. X-rays also “see” through it better. Fiberglass is water-resistant. But the padding underneath is not, so it’s best to keep it away from water. If you don’t have a fracture, your doctor may recommend a cast made of elastic or other soft material. It can be removed without a cast saw and could be a good choice for young children or someone who’s had surgery. Swelling Your cast may feel snug, especially the first few days after your injury. Usually it’s from your body swelling. To make it go down: Prop up the injured part of the body so it’s higher than your heart. If the cast is on your leg, lie down and put cushions or pillows underneath. This helps drain blood and fluids away from the injured area. Wiggle your fingers or toes on the injured arm or leg, and do it often. This also can prevent stiffness. Chill the cast from the outside with a plastic bag of ice, or an ice pack wrapped in a thin towel. Keep the ice on the cast at the site of the injury for 15-30 minutes. Repeat every few hours for the first few days. Be sure to keep the cast dry. If you feel sore or swollen, ask your doctors if you should take over-the-counter pain meds like acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Itching It can be maddening if you can’t reach a spot you need to scratch. Locate your itch, and tap it on the outside of the cast. You can also try blowing cool air from a hair dryer around the edges of the cast. Don’t give into temptation and stick a pencil, a ruler, or any other objects inside the cast to relieve the itch. That could break your skin. Avoid applying lotions, oils, deodorant, or powder in or around the cast. Infection It’s normal for your cast to get smelly after you’ve worn it for a while. But if you notice a foul odor or a discharge coming from the cast, it could mean your skin underneath is infected. Get it treated right away. When to Call Your Doctor You also should alert your doctor if you have: A fever (higher than 100 F for child and 101 F for adult) Numbness, tingling, burning, or stinging in the injured arm or leg Sores under the cast Pain or swelling that gets worse Cold, pale, or bluish skin A crack or soft spots in the cast Wet cast that won’t dry A cast that’s too tight or too loose Red or raw skin around the cast Trouble moving fingers or toes"
75,Splinters Treatment,"1. Clean Wound Clean the area with mild soap and water. 2. Care for a Tiny Splinter If it doesn't hurt, let the splinter work its way out over a few days . If it does hurt, touch the area gently with sticky tape and pull away carefully. If this doesn't work, try hair removal wax. 3. Remove Larger Splinter Clean a small needle and tweezers with alcohol. If you can see the end of the splinter, grip it with the tweezers and gently pull out the entire splinter. If none of the splinter is sticking out, follow the path of the splinter with the needle. Open the skin and expose enough of the splinter to remove it with tweezers. If you have trouble seeing the splinter, use stronger lighting and a magnifying glass. Clean wound area again. Apply a bandage and antibiotic ointment. 4. When to Call a Health Care Provider Most splinters do not need the care of a healthcare provider. See a healthcare provider if: You can't remove the entire splinter. The splinter is deep in the skin or the wound is bleeding heavily. The splinter is under a fingernail or toenail. The healthcare provider may need to cut a notch in the nail to remove the splinter. 5. Follow Up Ask the health care provider if a tetanus booster is needed. Watch for any signs of infection: redness, increasing pain, swelling, or pus at the site. Call a healthcare provider if you see any of these signs."
76,FAQ: Stage IV Lung Cancer With ALK Rearrangement,"Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer . It’s rare, but some people have NSCLC with “ALK rearrangement” or “ALK mutation.” You might also hear your doctor call this type of cancer  ALK-positive. Understanding what that means can help you better manage your health. It will also make it easier to talk to your doctors about your care and treatment. Here's what you need to know. What Is ALK Rearrangement (ALK Mutation)? While you’re still an embryo, the ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) gene tells your body how to make proteins that help cells grow. This gene finishes its job and turns itself off before you’re born. But in some people, the ALK later turns back on and becomes attached to another gene. This attachment, or fusion, causes a change in the gene that doctors call a mutation. When the ALK gene is mutated, it tells your body to make a protein that doesn’t work the right way. This faulty protein makes cancer cells grow and spread. This  mutation boosts your odds of several types of cancers, including lung cancer. ALK-positive lung cancer is usually adenocarcinoma, which means that it starts in the mucous glands of your lungs. Who Gets ALK-Positive Lung Cancer? About 5% of people with NSCLC have an ALK rearrangement. Scientists don’t know what causes this mutation. It’s not thought to be inherited. Unlike other lung cancers, ALK-positive cancer tends to affect people who have never smoked. It doesn’t seem to be linked to other causes of lung cancer, like asbestos or air pollution. It’s also more likely to be diagnosed in younger people than other types of  lung cancer. About half of people with ALK-positive lung cancer are diagnosed when they’re 50 or younger. Some get diagnosed in their teens or 20s. What Does Stage IV Mean? Staging means how far the cancer has spread to other body parts. Knowing this helps your doctor plan your treatment options. The higher the stage number, the more widespread your cancer is. Stage IV is the most advanced form. It means the disease has spread to parts of your body that are distant from your lungs, such as your liver or brain. This type is very hard to cure. About 90% of people who have ALK-positive lung cancer don’t find out until the disease has reached stage IV. With treatment, about half of people with stage IV ALK-positive lung cancer live nearly 7 years or longer. So if you have symptoms, see a doctor. What Are the Symptoms? Lung cancer may not cause problems until you’ve had it long enough for it to spread to other parts of your body. But talk to your doctor if you have: A cough that doesn’t go away Chest pain that gets worse with deep breathing, coughing, or laughing Hoarseness Weight loss without trying and loss of appetite Coughing up blood Shortness of breath A weak or tired feeling Wheezing When cancer spreads, as it has by the time it gets to stage IV, it can cause: Bone pain Problems related to your brain and nerves, like headaches, weakness or numbness in your arms or legs, dizziness , balance problems, or seizures Yellowed eyes or skin Lumps near the surface of your skin How Is It Diagnosed? If you have NSCLC, your doctor should test you for the ALK genetic mutation. This will help them find the best treatment for you. Your doctor will take a small sample of the tumor in a procedure called a biopsy and send it to a lab. The scientists at the lab will check the tumor's DNA for signs of the gene mutation. This test doesn’t check your personal DNA makeup. That means it can’t tell if your children or other members of your family have the mutation. Your doctor will also run tests to see how far the cancer has spread. You’ll get imaging tests to take pictures of other organs and body structures. Sometimes you might need another biopsy . If you get surgery to remove the tumor, the surgeon might find cancer that didn’t show up on other tests. Are There Treatments? Yes. Medicines called ALK inhibitors are the main kind. (You might also hear them called tyrosine kinase inhibitors or TKIs.) These drugs block the abnormal ALK protein so it can’t cause cancer cells to grow. Your doctor might call this “targeted therapy” because it zooms in on the cancer cells and disrupts their growth. You should take these drugs only if a lab test shows you have the mutation. They won't cure you, but they can improve your quality of life and help you survive longer. They’re sometimes paired with other treatments like chemotherapy, radiation, or surgery. In the past, the standard ALK inhibitor was crizotinib (Xalkori). Today, the standards are alectinib (Alecensa) and brigatinib (Alunbrig). Other ALK inhibitors include ceritinib ( Zykadia ) and lorlatinib ( Lorbrena ). All are pills that you take once or twice a day. Many people who take ALK inhibitors develop a resistance to them. Your cancer cells often mutate within 1-2 years after you start using a particular ALK inhibitor. When this happens, the medicine stops working. Your doctor can then prescribe a different ALK inhibitor, increase the dose of your current ALK inhibitor, or consider chemotherapy or radiation. They might suggest biopsying the tumor again to see exactly how the cancer cells have mutated. The results will help them decide which drug to prescribe next. What Are the Side Effects? Like all medicines, these drugs can cause other problems. The most common include: Diarrhea Fatigue Nausea Vomiting Blurry vision These side effects are usually mild, but not always. Stomach problems tend to be more severe with ceritinib. In rare cases, some people have to stop taking the drug. A small number of people get pneumonitis, an inflammation of the tissue in the walls of the lungs. It can be life-threatening. If you get it, your doctor will likely tell you to stop taking the drug. Before you take these drugs, your doctor should do an EKG to test your heart. ALK inhibitors have been linked to changes in the heartbeat or heart rate that aren’t explained by other health problems or medications. What About Chemotherapy? Your doctor might start you on chemotherapy before you get tested for the ALK rearrangement. If you’re ALK-positive and already on chemo, some experts say you should stick with it for several cycles -- as long as you can handle it and the cancer doesn’t spread. If the cancer does spread, your doctor may switch you to an ALK inhibitor. What Other Treatments Might I Need? This depends on how far your cancer has spread. If it has reached your brain, your doctor might suggest surgery or radiation . But newer ALK inhibitors are helping to reduce this need. Your doctor will prescribe other treatments to keep you as comfortable as possible. These often include: Medicines to ease your pain, shortness of breath, and other symptoms Procedures to remove fluid buildup from around your lungs to help you breathe better Be sure to tell your doctor about all your symptoms so you get the right treatments. How Often Will I See My Doctor? This also depends on the stage of your cancer. Your health care team will let you know how often you should come in for checkups. Keep all your appointments so your doctors can keep up with how you feel and how well your treatment is working. They may order regular follow-up tests, like: Blood work Lung tests Imaging tests to take pictures of the inside of your body, like CT scans or chest X-rays Can a Clinical Trial Help Me? Scientists are looking for new ways to fight lung cancer. A clinical trial may be a good option if what you’re doing isn’t working, especially if you have stage IV cancer. Ask your doctor about any clinical trials for ALK-positive lung cancer. Clinicaltrials.gov is another good place to try. Try typing ""ALK-positive lung cancer"" in the search box. Remember, you’re at the heart of your health care team. Taking a proactive approach to care and treatment can help you feel more in control. Deciding on the right treatment for cancer is a personal choice. It’s OK to ask questions if you’re not sure how a medicine or therapy might affect you, and to tell your doctor how you’re really doing -- physically and emotionally. It’s normal to have strong feelings when you’re dealing with cancer. Your doctor can put you in touch with a counselor and support group so you can talk to people who understand what you’re going through. Where Can I Find Support? A lung cancer diagnosis can bring up many emotions. Each person will feel and react differently to the news. Individual or group therapy can help. Your doctor can refer you to a therapist. A support group can also help you deal with the process and learn more about your condition. Several support groups and mentorship programs offer help to people with ALK-positive lung cancer. These include the ALK Positive Group and the American Lung Association’s online support community. Your doctor can help you find in-person groups in your area. How Can Palliative Care Help? Lung cancer and its treatments can cause fatigue, stress, and discomfort. Palliative care helps you manage these symptoms and side effects. Palliative care isn’t the same as hospice care. It’s a common part of cancer treatment, meant to make you more comfortable throughout the treatment and recovery process. It might include nausea or pain medication, extra oxygen to make breathing easier, or counseling. You can start palliative care when you’re diagnosed, and continue as long as you need it. Palliative care teams often work at hospitals, clinics, and long-term care facilities. Some might visit you at home. These teams might include doctors, nurses, social workers, chaplains, and nutritionists. If you’re interested in palliative care, talk to your health care team."
77,Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS),"What Is Stevens-Johnson Syndrome? Stevens-Johnson syndrome, also called SJS , is a rare but serious problem. Most often, it's a severe reaction to a medicine you've taken. It causes your skin to blister and peel off. It affects your mucous membranes, too. Blisters form inside your body, making it hard to eat, swallow, even pee. Getting treated right away helps protect your skin and other organs from lasting damage. SJS vs. TEN Stevens-Johnson syndrome is similar to a condition called toxic epidermal necrolysis, or TEN. TEN also causes your skin to slough off, and it's often a reaction of your immune system to a medication. It also can be caused by an infection, tumor, or vaccine. The main difference between SJS and TEN is scale. SJS usually affects 10% or less of your body's surface. TEN affects 30% or more. TEN is a life-threatening illness. About 25% of cases are fatal. SJS is much less lethal. The fatality rate is between 1% and 5%. Symptoms of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome Stevens-Johnson syndrome may feel like the flu at first. Then you'll get a rash that blisters, and your skin will peel. It can also affect your eyes and the inside of your mouth. (Photo Credit: Dr P. Marazzi/Science Source) SJS usually starts with a fever and feeling like you have the flu. A few days later, other symptoms appear, including: Painful red or purple skin that looks burned and peels off Blisters on your skin, mouth , nose, and genitals Red, painful, watery eyes The SJS rash is sometimes described as looking like a target: concentric circles that are lighter around the edges and darker in the center. SJS is dangerous. If you have these symptoms, go to the emergency room. Stevens-Johnson Syndrome Causes More than 100 drugs can cause SJS. Some of the most common are: Medicines for gout , a painful form of arthritis – especially allopurinol ( Aloprim , Zyloprim ) Pain relievers such as acetaminophen , ibuprofen , and naproxen sodium Sulfa antibiotics , a kind of drug that fights infections (including Bactrim and Septra ) Medicines that treat seizures or mental illness The medicines most likely to cause problems in kids are sulfa antibiotics , Tylenol, and drugs that treat seizures, especially carbamazepine ( Carbatrol , Tegretol ). If you're going to get SJS, it will most likely happen in the first 2 months you're taking a drug. An infection, like pneumonia or the herpes virus that causes cold sores , can also trigger SJS. This happens more often with kids than adults. Graft-versus-host disease, which you can get after a stem cell transplant, also can lead to SJS. You're more likely to get SJS if you have: HIV or other problems with your immune system, such as lupus Had SJS before Certain genes you inherit from your parents, especially a variation of a gene called human leukocyte antigen-B Radiation treatments Had a bone marrow transplant Sometimes, doctors can't pinpoint any specific cause for Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Stevens-Johnson Syndrome Diagnosis To figure out whether you have Stevens-Johnson syndrome, your health care provider will start by asking questions about your medical history, including any medications you've recently started or stopped taking. They'll also take a look at your rash. You may need more tests. They include: Skin biopsy, which involves removing a small sample of your skin. It will go to a lab to be tested. Culture, which involves removing skin, tissue, or fluid to send for testing. This can rule out infections that could be causing your condition. Imaging of your lungs to check for pneumonia, if your symptoms suggest it's causing your SJS Blood test, which involves taking a sample of your blood. It then goes to a lab to check for signs of infection. Your health care team also will look at your pain level, how fast the rash has spread, and how much of your skin is affected. Stevens-Johnson Syndrome Treatment You'll be treated for SJS in the hospital by a special team of doctors and nurses. Some people are treated in a burn center or intensive care unit. The first thing doctors will do is to stop the medication or treat the infection that made you sick. They'll also try to relieve your symptoms, prevent infections, and support your healing. Replace fluids and nutrients Your body needs to stay hydrated, and your skin needs protein to rebuild. You'll probably get fluids from an IV at first, then be fed through a tube that goes into your stomach through your nose. Wound care Hospital staff will keep your skin clean. They'll gently remove dead skin and cover bare patches with a special dressing. Eye care Your care team will clean your eyes and use special drops and creams to keep them from drying out. You could be in the hospital from 2 to 4 weeks. It takes time to recover from SJS, and most people do. Sometimes, SJS has effects that will show up years after you heal, including: Scars where your skin peeled Infections in your gums or mouth Lung problems such as bronchitis , which causes a bad cough and trouble breathing Stevens-Johnson Syndrome Complications Complications of SJS can include: Eye problems, including dry eyes, sensitivity to light, and long-term issues with your vision Pneumonia Shock Sepsis, which occurs when your entire body has an inflammatory reaction to an infection Multiple organ failure, in which more than one of your vital organs stop working properly. Those organs include your liver, kidneys, heart, brain, lungs, and small intestine. In the most serious cases, Stevens-Johnson syndrome can be fatal, but that's a relatively rare outcome. Other issues can crop up after you've recovered from SJS. Those longer-term problems might include: Sweating more than normal Dry or itchy skin Hair loss Losing your nails, or nails that are misshapen Changes to your sense of taste Dry mucous membranes that make it hard to pee Chronic fatigue Lung problems such as asthma or COPD Stevens-Johnson Syndrome Recovery Unless you get an infection, your skin will begin to heal in 2 to 3 weeks. You'll probably feel tired after you leave the hospital, and it might be weeks or months before you're feeling back to normal. If a medicine caused your SJS, you can't take it ever again. Stevens-Johnson Syndrome Prevention There's often no way to know how you'll react to certain medicines – even ones your doctor prescribes. If you're of Asian descent, you may have a gene that raises your risk of SJS. Talk to your doctor about getting tested for this gene before you take carbamazepine. If you've already had SJS, you can take steps to avoid getting it again: Tell your doctors you've had SJS. Wear a medical alert bracelet. Know the name of the medicine that caused your SJS. Avoid taking it or any drugs like it. Takeaways Stevens-Johnson syndrome starts out feeling like flu symptoms. Then you get a rash that blisters, turns into sores, and causes your skin to peel. It can affect your mucous membranes, too. It's usually a severe reaction to a medication. SJS is a dangerous disease that can have serious complications; it can be fatal. If you have it, you'll spend time in the hospital. Most people recover, although some have long-term complications. Stevens-Johnson Syndrome FAQs How serious is Stevens-Johnson syndrome? Stevens-Johnson syndrome is rarely fatal. But it's a serious disease that has to be treated in a hospital. You may need to be in intensive care or a burn unit. Almost everyone recovers from SJS, but some people have long-term complications that affect their skin, eyes, and lungs. How fast does Stevens-Johnson syndrome progress? SJS starts with a flu-like illness. Your eyes may burn, too. Then, in 1 to 3 days, a rash will appear on your skin and on your mucous membranes. With treatment, your skin will heal in 2 to 3 weeks. SJS can start up to 2 weeks after you've stopped taking the medication that triggered it. What can be mistaken for Stevens-Johnson syndrome? Some autoimmune diseases can cause your skin to blister, and that condition can look like SJS. It might also be confused with something called erythema multiforme major, another type of allergic reaction to medicine or infection."
78,Vascular Dementia,"Vascular dementia , also known as multi-infarct dementia is the second most common cause of dementia in older people. Because it has a lower profile than Alzheimer's, many people don't suspect vascular dementia when forgetfulness becomes problematic. It's also difficult to diagnose so it's difficult to know exactly how many people suffer from vascular dementia. Current estimates attribute 15% to 20% of dementia cases in older adults to vascular dementia. Determining the root cause can help determine the best action plan. If it's vascular dementia, certain lifestyle changes can help prevent further damage. WebMD takes a look at vascular dementia, its causes, symptoms, and prognosis. What Is Vascular Dementia? Compared to Alzheimer's disease , which happens when the brain 's nerve cells break down, vascular dementia happens when part of the brain doesn't get enough blood carrying the oxygen and nutrients it needs. Though they happen in different ways, it is possible to have both vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease . Discouraging as this sounds, there is ample reason to control the risk factors that contribute to vascular dementia. Allowing the condition to run its course without intervention can make Alzheimer's disease worse. What Causes Vascular Dementia? Vascular dementia occurs when vessels that supply blood to the brain become blocked or narrowed. Strokes take place when the supply of blood carrying oxygen to the brain is suddenly cut off. However, not all people with stroke will develop vascular dementia. Vascular dementia can occur over time as ""silent"" strokes pile up. Quite often, vascular dementia draws attention to itself only when the impact of so many strokes adds up to significant disability. Avoiding and controlling risk factors such as diabetes, high blood pressure, smoking, and high cholesterol can help curb the risk of vascular dementia. Catching the condition early also helps limit the impact and severity of vascular dementia. Early detection requires an awareness of risk factors and, more importantly, efforts to keep them under control. Anyone who suspects vascular dementia should talk with their doctor. Symptoms of Vascular Dementia Symptoms of vascular dementia depend on what part of the brain is affected and to what extent. Like Alzheimer's disease, the symptoms of vascular dementia are often mild for a long time. They may include: Problems with short-term memory Wandering or getting lost in familiar surroundings Laughing or crying at inappropriate times Trouble concentrating, planning, or following through on activities Trouble managing money Inability to follow instructions Loss of bladder or bowel control Hallucinations or delusions Symptoms that suddenly get worse often signal a stroke . Doctors look for symptoms that progress in noticeable stages to diagnose vascular dementia. Alzheimer's, by comparison, progresses at a slow, steady pace. Another clue is impaired coordination or balance. In vascular dementia, problems walking or balancing can happen early. With Alzheimer's, these symptoms usually occur late in the disease. Who Is at Risk for Vascular Dementia? Some risk factors for vascular dementia can be managed; others, like age and gender, cannot. Among all factors, high blood pressure carries the greatest risk; vascular dementia almost never occurs without it. Likewise, a high risk of stroke goes hand in hand with risk for vascular dementia. One-quarter to one-third of strokes are thought to result in some degree of dementia. People who smoke, consume excessive amounts of alcohol, have diabetes , or heart disease also have a higher rate of the condition. Vascular dementia most commonly occurs in people between the ages of 60 and 75. Men seem to be more vulnerable than women, and the condition affects African-Americans more often than other races. People whose age, sex, or race puts them at increased risk of vascular dementia have that much more reason to manage risk factors within their control. Vascular Dementia Treatment Currently, no available treatments can repair the damage of vascular dementia once it's happened. Nonetheless, diagnosis provides important knowledge and the opportunity to prevent further damage. Prevention typically involves bringing high blood pressure under control through exercise, diet, and medication . The same goes for diabetes if it exists. Patients should stop smoking and curb the use of alcohol. Though medical options are limited, behavioral interventions such as cues and reminders can improve the quality of life for everyone involved. Family members and friends can place notes in visible locations around the house with daily plans and instructions for how to use basic items. Stepping up communication, reminding the person with vascular dementia what day it is, where they live, and what is going on in the family, can help keep them connected to the here and now. Prognosis for People With Vascular Dementia If the conditions that cause vascular dementia go untreated, the prognosis is not good. A person with vascular dementia may seem to improve for periods of time until another stroke takes away more brain function, memory, and independence. Eventually, untreated vascular dementia usually ends in death from stroke, heart disease , or infection. Although vascular dementia is a serious condition, catching it early and preventing further damage are the best medicine. People with vascular dementia can work with their doctors and families to detect and manage the condition."
79,Congenital Heart Disease Explained,"""Congenital heart defect"" is another way of saying someone’s heart had a problem at birth. The heart may have had a small hole in it or something more severe. Although these can be serious conditions, many can be treated with surgery. In some cases, doctors can find these problems in a baby before it’s born. Sometimes, it’s diagnosed in childhood or when you’re an adult. If you or your baby has a congenital heart defect, there might not be symptoms until adulthood, or there might be no symptoms at all. Causes Doctors don’t always know why a baby has a congenital heart defect. They tend to run in families, and the chances of having congenital heart defects rises if a parent or any relatives have problems. Other things that make these defects more likely include: Problems with genes or chromosomes in the child, such as Down syndrome . With certain gene changes, a baby’s chances of having a defect can go up by as much as 50%. Smoking or alcohol or drug misuse during pregnancy. All can lead to congenital heart defects and other problems with a baby’s development. Avoid them if you’re pregnant. Certain medication. Some medicines can make heart and other birth defects more likely if a woman uses them during pregnancy. Among them are the acne medication isotretinoin and anti- seizure drugs that contain valproate . If you’re pregnant, your doctor may be able to switch you to another medicine until your baby is born. A viral infection like rubella ( German measles ) in the first trimester of pregnancy . If a woman has rubella during pregnancy, it can create problems with the baby’s heart. Most people are vaccinated in childhood. If you’re pregnant and weren’t vaccinated, or if you’re not sure, tell your doctor. If you need to get vaccinated for rubella, you should wait at least a month after getting vaccinated before you get pregnant . Diabetes. D iabetes in the mother may affect the formation and growth of her baby’s heart. Gestational diabetes , which develops during pregnancy, shouldn’t raise a baby ’s chance of having a heart defect. Types Most congenital heart problems are structural issues like holes and leaky valves. They include: Heart valve defects. One may be too narrow or completely closed. That makes it hard for blood to get through. Sometimes, it can’t get through at all. In other cases, the valve might not close properly, so the blood leaks backward. Problems with the heart’s ""walls."" It could be the ones between the chambers (atria and ventricles) of your heart. Holes or passageways between the left and right side of the heart might cause blood to mix when it shouldn’t. Issues with the heart’s muscle. These can lead to heart failure , which means the heart doesn’t pump as efficiently as it should. Bad connections among blood vessels. In babies, this may let blood that should go to the lungs go to other parts of the body instead, or vice versa. These defects can deprive blood of oxygen and lead to organ failure. Symptoms Adults may have a heart-related birth defect and not notice symptoms. If they do, they can include: Shortness of breath Problems with exercise The symptoms of congenital heart disease in infants and children may include: A bluish tint to the skin , fingernails, and lips (cyanosis, a condition caused by a lack of oxygenated blood) Fast breathing and poor feeding Poor weight gain Lung infections An inability to exercise Diagnosis Before birth Doctors may find some problems during pregnancy. Your doctor may be able to identify a defect before your baby’s birth with: A fetal echocardiogram. This test uses pictures made by an ultrasound to show the heart in motion so your doctor can see things that are wrong with its valves and structure. Gene testing. A geneticist takes a small blood sample before or during your pregnancy . It’s important because if you or a family member has an abnormality, your child’s chances of having it can go up by as much as 50%. In childhood Other problems may be found in infants or kids. The doctor listens to your child’s heartbeat to check their health. If they hear an unusual sound or heart murmur , they might order more tests, such as: Echocardiogram. This is a painless type of ultrasound that takes pictures of the  heart. It can spot almost any kind of congenital heart defect and usually takes less than an hour. There are different kinds of echocardiograms, so ask your doctor what to expect. Electrocardiogram ( ECG or EKG ). This measures the heart’s electrical activity. This test can diagnose heart rhythm problems, called arrhythmias, and find parts of the heart that are too large or working too hard. Chest X-ray. An X-ray can show the doctor signs of an enlarged or unusually shaped heart and reveal signs of heart failure , such as fluid in the lungs . MRI and CT scans. Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography scans are two more types of imaging tests that can provide detailed views of the heart. Pulse oximetry. This measures the oxygen level in your child’s blood through a finger sensor. If it shows too little, it could signal a heart problem. Cardiac catheterization. If any of the previous tests shows that your child has a congenital heart defect, their doctor may recommend a cardiac catheterization. A doctor guides a very thin, flexible tube (called a catheter) through a blood vessel in the arm or leg to reach the heart. They put dye through the catheter and then use X-ray videos to see inside the heart. In adults Some people with congenital heart defects don’t find out they have problems until later in life. Your doctor might find issues during a routine physical, or you might notice symptoms. Your doctor could also find it after you’ve had a heart test like an echocardiogram. Treatment If you or a loved one has a congenital heart defect, the chances that it can be fixed are better than ever.  Some defects may not need any treatment. For some people, treatment may include many surgeries or other procedures. For others, it takes only one. Some children and adults may need to take medicine for the rest of their lives. They might also need to make regular visits to their heart specialist, called a cardiologist. Medicines Congenital defects can put a strain on the heart, causing it to work harder. To keep your heart from getting weaker with this extra work, your doctor may try to treat you with medications . They are aimed at easing the burden on the heart muscle. You need to control your blood pressure if you have any type of heart problem. Some common medicines that lower blood pressure might also slow the heart rate and reduce fluid buildup in your body. These include: ARBs and ACE inhibitors . These are two widely used types of medicines that lower blood pressure. They relax blood vessels, which makes it easier for your heart to pump blood . Beta-blockers. These medicines that slow your heart rate and help widen arteries . Some examples of beta blockers that your doctor might prescribe are atenolol ( Tenormin ), carvedilol ( Coreg CR), and metoprolol (Lopressor). Diuretics . Also called water pills, these medications lower fluid levels. Less blood volume can lower your blood pressure. Medications may be enough to help treat mild cases or be used when surgery isn’t a good option. Other times, doctors will need to do more. Procedures Thanks to new technology, doctors have easier and better ways to fix these defects. Depending on the problem, your baby may get surgery or catheterization within hours of being born. Other times, it may happen days or months later. Sometimes, infants need several procedures as they grow up. As their heart gets bigger, replacement valves, for example, will need to be changed. Your doctor will tell you what they’ll need, and when. There are two main options for procedures for congenital heart defects. One uses a catheter, which doesn’t require opening the chest. The other is open-heart surgery. Cardiac catheterization More and more, doctors are able to repair hearts using catheters. These procedures, known as cardiac catheterizations, are used for two main heart repairs: closing a hole or opening a narrowed valve or artery . Doctors can, for example, repair holes in the wall that separates the heart’s left and right sides. This is a common congenital heart defect called an atrial septal defect (ASD). Using a catheter, the doctor can place a tiny umbrella-shaped patch over the hole. Tissue will form over the covering and keep the wall together. Doctors can also widen a narrowed artery or stiff valve. And they can use one to close off a vessel if it’s carrying blood in the wrong direction, or place a patch over a hole. They can also fit a catheter with a tiny balloon and direct it toward a valve or artery that isn’t working right. The doctor can inflate the balloon to widen the valve or artery. This allows the blood to flow better. When it is done for a valve, it’s called a valvuloplasty. When it’s done in an artery, it’s called an angioplasty . Catheter procedures alone might not fix every issue. Some people need medicine, and children might need surgery when they are a little older. But these procedures can make blood flow better and keep your baby healthy while care continues in the months and years ahead. Open-heart surgery In some cases, your doctor will tell you that you or your baby needs open heart surgery. With this surgery, a doctor has to cut through the breastbone to operate on the heart directly. Defects that might be treated with open-heart surgery include holes in the heart, valve problems, and narrow arteries. Because a heart grows in size along with its owner, some people may need more surgeries or other procedures years later. If you need open-heart surgery, you’ll get general anesthesia, so you won’t be awake or feel pain during the procedure. Recovery After a procedure or surgery, a baby is taken to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). The amount of time your little one spends there will depend on the procedure and how the recovery is going. When the doctors say it’s OK to bring your baby home, they’ll give you plenty of instructions on home care, follow-up appointments, and what to do if you have questions or concerns. Adult patients go to a standard intensive care unit (ICU). Assuming that your recovery goes well, you will transfer later to what hospitals call a step-down room before you can go home. You might feel some pain in the days after open heart surgery. Your doctor should give you instructions about your medications and how to care for the area after your surgery. You should also ask about how to look for signs of any infections or other problems, and when you should call your doctor. Because catheters need only a small cut in the leg, the recovery is much easier and faster than it is for open-heart surgery. With either type of procedure, follow-up appointments are important. Feel free to ask any questions, whether they are about how to bathe your child who had heart surgery or about what kind of care you’ll need in the future. Other things to keep in mind The time it takes doctors to do these procedures depends on the situation. Don’t be concerned if it takes a few hours. You can ask ahead of time how long it will take, but remember this is only an estimate. Babies with congenital heart defects, even those who have had a successful surgery, often tire more quickly than other children their age. That can happen as they feed, which in turn may slow their growth for a while. Talk with your doctor or nurses about whether you should change your baby’s feeding schedule. They may be a little slower to reach some early milestones relating to height, weight , rolling over, and sitting up. Seek out family and friends for their support, as this is naturally an anxious time. Ask any questions of the doctors or nurses involved with your baby’s care. More information often means more peace of mind. When to Call a Doctor Not all symptoms of congenital heart defects require a call to a doctor. For example, your doctor may have identified a heart murmur when they listened to your baby’s heartbeat. Some heart defects can cause murmurs, which are basically just extra noise during a heartbeat. But not all murmurs are symptoms of a heart defect. In fact, they’re common in healthy children, too. But if your baby’s doctor notices one, they may refer you to a pediatric cardiologist, or children’s heart doctor. Other symptoms, however, can mean it’s time to check in with your doctor. Serious issues include: Blue skin or cyanosis . Your baby could have a bluish tint to their skin, especially around their mouth and fingers. It happens when their heart can’t pump enough blood through their lungs to get oxygen to the rest of their body. Look for signs of cyanosis when they are crying or feeding. And call your doctor right away if they appear. Poor circulation. If your baby tires easily and isn’t growing at the normal rate for their age, they may have poor blood circulation. Your doctor can check on that. This is true for older children, as well, who tire easily during routine play. Check with your pediatrician if you notice any of these symptoms. Trouble breathing . Shortness of breath isn’t normal in healthy children. If your baby grunts when breathing or has trouble catching their breath during feedings, call your doctor. Inflammation . If you notice swelling in your baby’s legs, in their abdomen , or around their eyes , call your doctor. These are serious signs of a heart defect or even heart failure . Heart failure. Heart failure is very serious, but it can often be treated. Call your doctor immediately if you notice any of these s igns of heart failure : Buildup of fluid in the body Fatigue Shortness of breath Swelling in the stomach or lower legs Chest pains. If your baby has chest pain or sudden cardiac arrest (their heart rhythm becomes uneven and they lose consciousness or become unresponsive), call 911. Tell the emergency workers that they have a congenital heart defect. Ask your doctor what else you should watch for. Once you have that knowledge, you can have more peace of mind that your child will be OK. Growing Up With a Congenital Heart Defect If your child has a congenital heart defect, you’ll have a lot of questions and concerns. But try to remember that many children grow up with these conditions and live long, healthy lives. Regular care is important. Congenital heart defects raise your child’s chance of other heart problems later. So it’s important to keep up regular visits with a pediatric, or children’s, cardiologist as part of their care. Some congenital heart defects don’t need treatment until adulthood. Bicuspid aortic valve disease, for example, is when a baby is born with two “leaflets” in the valve instead of three. Symptoms are rare, but a doctor might need to repair or replace the valve when the person is in their 40s, 50s, or even 60s. Your child has a higher risk of heart problems. They are more likely to get infections of their heart, called infective endocarditis. They may also have heart rhythm problems, called arrhythmias, and to have possible heart failure . Your child may be able to take part in sports and physical activity. These are probably still possible -- with some limits. Talk to your child’s doctor about what activities are safe and what precautions you should take. They may advise against contact sports, for example. Just know the signs that your child is overdoing it, such as shortness of breath, major fatigue , or needing a long time to recover from play. Stay aware. Serious heart defects can cause your child to grow slower. As a baby , they might even get tired during feedings and eat less than a healthy child. As a result, they could be smaller than their friends. This is normal, but they should “catch up” by the time they reach adulthood. Endocarditis People with congenital heart defects are more likely to have inflammation of the inner layer of their heart (called endocarditis), especially if their heart was repaired or replaced through surgery. To protect yourself: Tell all doctors and dentists you have congenital heart disease. You may want to carry a card with this information. Call your doctor if you have symptoms of an infection ( sore throat , general body aches, fever ). Take good care of your teeth and gums to prevent infections. Make regular visits to your dentist . If your doctor recommends it, take antibiotics before you have any medical work that may cause bleeding, like dental work and most surgeries. Check with your doctor about the type and amount of antibiotics that you should take."
80,Allergies: Basic Info You Need to Know,"What Is an Allergy? Airborne allergens, such as pollen, can be a major trigger for allergies. (Photo Credit: iStock/Getty Images) You get allergies when your immune system responds to substances such as pollen, pet dander, or certain foods. Your antibodies identify these allergens as bad for you, even though they're not. How common are they? Nearly 18 million adults in the United States have hay fever, or allergic rhinitis. At least 1 in 3 American adults and 1 in 4 children have allergies. Doctors don’t know exactly how many adults are diagnosed with allergies for the first time. But nasal allergies affect more Americans every year, according to the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology. Whatever the case, allergies are all over, and they’re big business. They’re the sixth-leading cause of chronic illness in the U.S., according to the CDC. And they cost Americans more than $18 billion a year. Allergic Reactions Allergic reactions happen when you come into contact with an allergen. Your immune system reacts by releasing histamines and other chemicals into your blood, causing symptoms that can irritate your skin, sinuses, or digestive system. Common allergens include: Airborne allergens : Pollen, pet dander, dust mites, mold Certain foods : Peanuts, tree nuts, shellfish, eggs, and dairy Insect stings : Bees and wasps Medications Latex Allergy Symptoms Your allergy symptoms will vary, depending on what you're allergic to and how you’re exposed. Allergens can enter your body in several ways: Through your nasal passages and into your lungs Through your mouth Through your skin Through absorption from an insect sting If you have a mild allergic reaction, common symptoms might be: Itchy, watery eyes Sneezing Itchy, runny nose Feeling tired or ill Rashes and hives Symptoms of a food allergy could include: Tingling in your mouth Swelling of your lips, tongue, face, or throat Hives Stomach cramps , vomiting, or diarrhea Anaphylaxis An allergic reaction to an insect sting might cause any of these: Swelling, redness, and pain at the site of the sting Itching or hives Chest discomfort or tightness Coughing Anaphylaxis A severe allergic reaction could produce problems such as: Belly pain Anxiety Chest tightness Coughing Diarrhea A hard time breathing or swallowing Dizziness Swelling of the face, eyes, or tongue Anaphylaxis If you have any of these severe symptoms, call your doctor or seek medical help right away. Is It Anaphylaxis? Some allergic reactions are mild, but others can produce life-threatening problems, including anaphylaxis, which is a whole-body allergic reaction. You have to treat anaphylaxis with epinephrine (adrenaline) within minutes. If you have an epinephrine auto-injector, use it and repeat after 5 to 15 minutes if your symptoms haven’t improved. You still need to get medical care after using an EpiPen, even if you get better. Signs of anaphylaxis include: Hives and itching all over Wheezing or shortness of breath Hoarseness or tightness in your throat Swelling of your face, eyelids, lips, tongue , or throat Tingling in your hands, feet, lips, or scalp If you have any signs of anaphylaxis, call 911. Testing for Allergies An allergy test measures how your body responds to certain triggers. If your immune system overreacts, you have an allergy. Your body will produce antibodies called immunoglobulin E (IgE). There are different types of allergy tests. Which one your doctor chooses depends on your symptoms and the suspected causes. Skin-prick or scratch test Your health care provider will use a thin needle that contains an allergen to prick your skin. Or they might put droplets of allergens on your skin and then scratch your skin so the allergens can get in. The test could use your forearm or back. If you're allergic, within 15 minutes, a rash or raised spots – called wheals – will appear. You might be tested for many allergies at once. Intradermal skin test If the skin-prick test doesn't yield enough information, your doctor may try this test next. A small amount of an allergen is injected into the outer layer of your skin. The doctor is looking for a rash or other reaction. Patch test This checks for contact dermatitis, a reaction that happens when your skin comes in contact with an allergen. Your health care provider puts drops of an allergen on the surface of your skin and covers the spot with a bandage. Or the allergen may be on the bandage itself. You leave the bandage in place for at least 2 days. Then you go back to your doctor, who removes the bandage and checks for a reaction. Blood test Your health care provider draws a blood sample and sends it to a lab. At the lab, allergens are added to your blood, and then it's tested for levels of IgE antibodies. This test has a higher rate of false positives, indicating you have an allergy when you really don't. Challenge test Typically, an allergy specialist, called an allergist, does this test. You'll swallow a small amount of a suspected allergen – a food or drug – while a health care provider closely watches you in case you get anaphylaxis. If you do, you'll get an epinephrine shot right away to stop the reaction. To prepare for an allergy test, you'll need to stop your allergy medication 3 to 7 days ahead of time. Those drugs can interfere with the test. Allergies and Your Diet There is no cure for allergies, including what you eat. But your diet might help with how bad your symptoms get. Here are some of the foods that researchers are studying to see if they might help ease allergies. Good fats Researchers are studying whether polyunsaturated fatty acids such as omega-3s can help prevent allergies in children. Foods such as salmon, mackerel, tuna, flaxseeds, chia seeds, and walnuts are high in omega-3s, which help ease inflammation. Researchers think eating these may lower the risk of childhood asthma and allergy. In one Swedish study, children who had higher levels of these fatty acids in their blood at age 8 were less likely to have nasal allergies by age 16. But more research is needed to confirm if that is because of the polyunsaturated fatty acids in their diets or something else. Mediterranean diet A large study of children in Crete (part of Greece) found that children who stuck to a Mediterranean diet full of fruits, vegetables, whole-grain breads and cereals, and legumes and nuts were less likely to have hay fever. Allergy Management Steps you can take to help control your allergies include: Avoid the allergens, if you can. Take allergy medicines . Consider allergy shots (immunotherapy), which can reduce your immune system's response. To get the most benefit, you'll need to take allergy shots for 3 to 5 years. This can be an expensive option, but it offers the best hope of long-term relief. The effects can last even after you stop taking the shots."
81,What Is Leukodystrophy?,"Leukodystrophy isn’t just one disease; it’s actually a group of diseases that affect the central nervous system. Doctors are discovering new forms of leukodystrophy all the time, but experts currently know of about 52 different kinds. Most of the leukodystrophies are genetic, meaning they’re passed down from parent to child. Sometimes symptoms will show up early in childhood. But because the diseases are progressive, meaning they get worse over time, some children born with a form of leukodystrophy may seem fine. Symptoms The one thing all leukodystrophies have in common is they cause abnormal development or destruction of the brain’s myelin sheath. That’s the white fatty matter that protects the brain’s nerves. Without it, your nervous system can’t function properly. But each leukodystrophy affects myelin differently. That means children can have many problems, including: Balance and mobility problems Behavioral and learning disabilities Bladder issues Breathing difficulties Developmental delays Hearing, speech, and vision problems Muscle control disorders Seizures For example, one type of leukodystrophy, Canavan disease, causes decreased muscle tone, especially in the neck, and abnormally straight legs and flexed arms. It can also include symptoms like blindness and seizures. Sometimes symptoms show up soon after a child is born, and sometimes as late as adulthood. Signs of Refsum Disease, for example, usually occur around age 20, but can be as late as age 50. Some of the common symptoms include degeneration of the retina in the eye, deafness, and loss of sense of smell. While every leukodystrophy is different, the most common problem is a child’s health gradually worsening in some way, even though they seemed fine to start with. This can be a worsening of their vision, hearing, speech, ability to eat, behavior, or thought. Since symptoms can vary so much, leukodystrophy can be hard to diagnose. Causes Most of the leukodystrophies are inherited, which means they’re passed down through family genes. Some may not be inherited, but are still caused by a genetic mutation. One child in your family could have leukodystrophy, and others might not. For example, Alexander disease doesn’t seem to be genetically inherited, so your child can have a defective gene even if neither you nor your partner have it. If you have a child with leukodystrophy and you’re planning to have more children, you may want to consider genetic counseling. It can help you understand your chances of having another child with leukodystrophy. Diagnosis Diagnosing leukodystrophy can be difficult. Oftentimes, doctors have to use several types of testing, including: Blood and urine analysis CT scans Genetic testing MRI scans Psychological and cognitive tests Treatment There is no cure for most kinds of leukodystrophy. Treating it depends on the type, and doctors address the symptoms of the disease with medications and special kinds of physical, occupational, and speech therapy. Some people may need additional help with learning or nutrition. In some cases, a bone marrow transplant can help by slowing or stopping the progression of the disease. Scientists are also researching whether gene therapy or replacing certain enzymes can help treat some kinds of leukodystrophy."
82,What Is SIDS?,"New parents do everything they can to keep their babies healthy. But sometimes, a baby who seems perfectly fine passes away for no clear reason. When this happens to an infant under the age of 1, doctors refer to it as sudden infant death syndrome , or SIDS. Because it often happens when a baby is asleep, you might also hear it called crib death or cot death. The fact that it’s so hard to predict makes SIDS the leading cause of death for babies younger than 12 months in the U.S. It claims about 1,600 infants every year. What Causes SIDS? Doctors aren’t sure, but they have a few ideas. Some babies have a gene or a change to their genes that causes certain health problems that can lead to SIDS . Other babies are born with problems in the part of their brain that controls breathing , heart rate , blood pressure , temperature, and waking from sleep . Right now, there’s no way to test for these issues. But researchers found some things that, when put together, raise a little one’s risk: A hidden health problem, like brain defects Being in the first 6 months of life Stress from something like a poor sleep position, secondhand smoke , or a respiratory infection Remember, none of these by itself is enough to cause SIDS. Risk Factors for SIDS You can’t predict whether your family will be touched by SIDS, but there are a few things that make it more likely: Age . It’s most common for babies between 2 and 4 months. But it can happen at any time during the first year of life. Sex. It’s more likely to affect boys, but only slightly. Race . It happens most often among African-Americans, Native Americans, and Alaska natives. Doctors aren’t sure why. Birth weight. It’s more likely in preemies, especially those born very small, than full-term babies. Familyhistory . A baby ’s odds are high if a sibling or cousin passed away from SIDS. Mom’s health . It’s more likely to happen to a baby whose mother: Is younger than 20 Doesn’t get good prenatal care Smokes, uses drugs, or drinks alcohol while pregnant or during baby’s first year Can You Prevent SIDS? Yes. There are a few easy things you can do to prevent SIDS and keep your little one safe: Put your baby on their back to sleep . Once they can roll over on their own, it’s safe for them to sleep on their tummy. Until then, remember this phrase: “back to sleep.” It’ll help keep your baby’s odds of having SIDS much lower. Choose a firm, flat surface for their bed . Use tight-fitting sheets. Keep pillows, blankets, and other objects out of their sleep area until they are at least 1. You can swaddle them for warmth, but only until they learn how to roll over. Sleep in the same room, but not in the same bed. Sharing a room with your baby can cut their chances in half. But sleeping in the same bed with them raises their odds. Try not to fall asleep while sitting up and holding your baby. Use a pacifier , vaccinate, and breastfeed if you can. All three lower their risk. Keep them cool while they are asleep. Don’t overdress them when you put them down. Their room should be cool and comfortable. You can use a special wearable blanket (called a sleep sack) that covers their body and leaves their face uncovered. Don’t smoke, drink, or use drugs. It’s bad for your growing baby when you’re pregnant. Using drugs and alcohol might even make you a less alert or careful parent. Breathing in secondhand smoke can also raise the odds of SIDS. Stay healthy during pregnancy . Avoid risky behaviors, eat healthy food, and see your doctor for regular checkups."
83,Understanding Encephalitis: The Basics,"What Is Encephalitis? Encephalitis (pronounced en-sef-uh- lie -tis) is inflammation of your brain tissue. It can be very serious and may cause personality changes, seizures , weakness, and other symptoms, depending on the part of your brain affected. Encephalitis is an inflammation in your brain. Most cases are caused by infection with a virus, such as the herpes simplex virus. (Photo Credit: Science Photo Library/Getty Images) Encephalitis is rare, affecting about 10-15 in 100,000 people each year in the U.S. Young children, older adults, and those with a weak immune system are most vulnerable. It's usually caused by an infection with viruses, bacteria, fungi, or parasites, although it can be caused by an autoimmune condition or some medicines as well. Most people who have mild encephalitis fully recover. Your treatment and chance of recovery depend on the cause and severity of your inflammation. In acute encephalitis, the infection directly affects your brain cells. In parainfectious encephalitis, your brain and spinal cord become inflamed within 1-2 weeks of contracting an infection (usually viral or bacterial) . Encephalitis vs. meningitis Encephalitis and meningitis are both diseases that cause inflammation in your brain. However, while encephalitis is an inflammation of your brain tissue, meningitis is an inflammation of the membranes that cover your brain and spinal cord (called meninges). Like encephalitis, meningitis is often caused by a viral or bacterial infection, but it can also be caused by fungal or parasitic infections, injuries, certain drugs, and some types of cancer. Is encephalitis contagious? Swelling in your brain isn’t contagious, but the causes can be. For example, viral encephalitis can be caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV) that can pass from person to person. Childhood diseases, such as measles, mumps, and German measles (Rubella), used to be a common cause of viral encephalitis in kids, but these causes are a bit rarer now since most people get vaccinated against them before they start school. Encephalitis Causes Viral infections with any of the following three groups of viruses are the most common cause of encephalitis. These include: Herpes viruses, which include HSV (especially HSV-1), chickenpox, cytomegalovirus, and Epstein-Barr virus Viruses that are transmitted through bugbites, such as West Nile virus , Dengue virus, and Eastern equine encephalitis virus Viruses that cause childhood infections, such as measles, mumps, and Rubella Less commonly, encephalitis may be caused by: Infection with HIV or the virus that causes rabies Bacterial and other infections, such as syphilis or toxoplasmosis (an infection with a parasite from infected cat poop) Autoimmune conditions Some kinds of cancer Some medicines Sometimes, your doctor may not be able to tell what caused your encephalitis. Encephalitis Types Infectious encephalitis It is usually caused by a viral infection but can also be caused by bacteria, fungi, and parasites. As it's usually caused by viral infections, it's more common in people who are exposed to bugs that can transmit diseases, such as people who spend a lot of time outdoors, especially near standing water. Infectious encephalitis can develop quickly and the symptoms can be serious. Autoimmune encephalitis It is usually caused by proteins that your body makes in your brain. These proteins cause inflammation in your brain. Doctors don't yet know for sure why some people develop these proteins, while other people don't. Autoimmune encephalitis tends to develop more slowly than infectious encephalitis and may cause more neurological symptoms, such as confusion, memory issues, and seizures. It's also rarer than infectious encephalitis. Some conditions that are linked to autoimmune encephalitis include: Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis Hashimoto’s encephalopathy LGI1/CASPR2-antibody encephalitis Limbic encephalitis Rasmussen’s encephalitis Both infectious and autoimmune encephalitis can cause serious, life-threatening symptoms. If you or someone else has neurological symptoms, such as irritability, seizures, or extreme drowsiness, call 911 or go to the emergency room right away. Encephalitis Symptoms Your symptoms depend on the type of encephalitis you have. People with infectious encephalitis may have symptoms of an infection before they get encephalitis. Signs of encephalitis can include: Fatigue or loss of energy Fever, especially a high fever Headache that can be severe Sensitivity to light and sound Mild-to-moderate neck stiffness Drowsiness or loss of consciousness Irritability, anxiety, and behavioral or personality changes Hallucinations Signs of severe encephalitis may include: Weakness or trouble moving some parts of your body Double vision Confusion, trouble speaking, or difficulty understanding when someone talks to you Coma Seizures A bulging soft spot (fontanel) in infants Go to the ER or call 911 right away if you or someone else has any signs of severe encephalitis. Encephalitis Diagnosis Your doctor will ask about your symptoms, including how long you've had them. Because people with encephalitis can be disoriented, family and friends are key to getting a good history. It's important to know if you've come into contact with mosquitoes or ticks , infected animals, or sick people. Your doctor will also do a physical exam and may order some tests. Encephalitis tests Some of the tests your doctor may use include: Blood tests, including a complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel Urine, stool, or sputum culture tests to see if you have an infection and what type you have Imaging tests, such as CT scans, MRI scans, and magnetoencephalography (MEG) to see where in your brain you are having seizures Electroencephalogram (EEG) to look for seizers or specific electrical activity in your brain Spinal tap (lumbar puncture) to remove cerebrospinal fluid to find infections in your brain or spinal cord A neurological exam, which is a series of tests that show how well your nervous system is working An intracranial pressure monitoring (ICP) to measure the pressure inside your skull Rarely, a biopsy of your brain tissue to look at under a microscope Encephalitis Risk Factors Several risk factors could increase your chance of getting encephalitis. These include: Age. Young children and older adults are at a higher risk for viral encephalitis. Some types of autoimmune encephalitis are more common in children and young adults. Having a weakened immune system. This could be because you have HIV, take medicines for cancer, or have a condition such as diabetes. Having an autoimmune condition. Smoking. Living in areas where mosquito- or tick-borne viruses spread easily, particularly in the summer months. Encephalitis Treatment Because the complications from encephalitis can be serious, you may need to go to the hospital. You will usually need monitoring for your blood pressure, heart rate, and breathing. You will also usually need IV fluid therapy to help keep your brain from swelling more. Otherwise, your treatment will depend on your age, condition, and the cause of your disease. Some common treatments include: Steroids that can help reduce swelling in your brain Antiviral drugs, such as acyclovir (Zovirax), Foscarnet (Foscavir), or Ganciclovir (Cytovene) for people who have viral encephalitis Antibiotics for people with bacterial encephalitis Anticonvulsant therapy for people with seizures Immune globulin and plasmapheresis for people with autoimmune encephalitis Over-the-counter medicines, such as acetaminophen, that can help control fever and headaches Supportive care Supportive care is a type of care for patients who are seriously ill. The goal is to focus your treatment on what is most important to you. This may involve, for instance, focusing on relieving your symptoms and how other treatments will affect how you feel. You usually get supportive care alongside specific treatments for your condition. Examples of supportive care may include: Use of a ventilator or other breathing help, such as an oxygen mask IV fluids to keep you hydrated Medications for pain, inflammation, infection, seizures, and other issues Post encephalitis therapy Once you have been treated for encephalopathy and the inflammation is gone, you may still need some treatment and support to continue your recovery. Some people need help such as: Physical therapy to help regain your muscle strength to stand, walk, or perform regular tasks. Occupational therapy (OT), which often works hand in hand with physical therapy. OT helps you work on your everyday skills and may give you ideas for adaptations, such as special tools, if you need help with some of your day-to-day activities. Speech therapy, which helps you regain or fine-tune your ability to speak or communicate clearly. Brain rehabilitation or retraining, which helps you improve your memory and your cognition. Psychotherapy, which helps you learn how to cope with changes in your life and manage your moods and behavior. Encephalitis Complications After you recover from the swelling in your brain, from encephalitis, you may have long-term damage in your brain that needs ongoing medical care. For instance, some people may have long-term problems, such as: Memory loss (amnesia) Personality and behavioral changes Emotional and psychological problems, such as anxiety, depression, and mood swings Problems with attention, concentration, planning, and problem-solving Repeated seizures (epilepsy) Hearing loss Speech and language problems Problems swallowing Problems with balance, coordination, and movement Long-term fatigue In severe cases, loss of consciousness (coma) and death Encephalitis Prevention The best way to avoid getting encephalitis is to avoid the germs that can cause it. Here are some tips: Get yourself and your kids vaccinated, as recommended by your doctors. The elimination of smallpox and the availability of vaccines that prevent mumps , measles , and rubella have lowered cases of encephalitis , especially in children. If you're traveling in an area that has a high risk of tick-borne or mosquito-borne viruses, make sure you get vaccinated before you head out. The CDC's website has a travelers' health page where you can look up your destination and get a list of all the recommended vaccines for that location. Wash your hands completely and often with soap and water throughout your day, especially before you handle food, eat or drink, and after using the bathroom. Don't share food, eating utensils, or glasses. Don't share personal-care items and remind your kids not to share their things, such as razors, towels, makeup, or toothbrushes. Take these steps to avoid getting bitten by mosquitoes and ticks: Avoid being outside between dusk and dawn when mosquitoes are most likely to bite you. If do have to be out then, wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants. Make sure mosquitoes can't get into your house through broken screens and windows. Also, run a fan, which can keep mosquitos moving around so they're less likely to land on and bite you. Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants when you're in wooded areas with tall grasses and shrubs, where ticks like to hang out. Check yourself, your kids, and your pets for ticks when they come inside during tick season (this can be year-round for people in the U.S. South and on the West Coast, but for most of the U.S., it's early spring to winter). Use bug repellent and insecticide. You can use the mosquito repellent DEET on both your skin and clothes. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recommends spraying your clothes, tents, and outdoor gear with products that contain permethrin to repel and kill both mosquitoes and ticks. Don't spray permethrin on your skin, though. For infants younger than 2 months, you can't use insect repellent, so cover their carrier or stroller with mosquito netting. For infants and children older than 2 months old, you can use 10%-30% DEET products. Don't use a combined sunscreen and DEET product because you'll need to reapply sunscreen for a full day of outside play. Reapplying a DEET-containing product can expose your child to high levels of DEET. Get rid of standing water outside your house. Mosquitoes lay their eggs in standing water. Common problem areas for standing water are old flowerpots, flat roofs, old tires, and clogged gutters. Report any sick or dying birds or small animals to your local health department. They could be infected with viruses such as West Nile virus that cause encephalitis. Encephalitis Prognosis Your symptoms can last anywhere from a few days to a couple of months. Some people with complications may take another few months to fully recover. However, with treatment, most people recover from encephalitis. Your outlook depends on a few things, such as: What caused your encephalitis. Some causes, such as an HSV infection, may cause fewer issues, so people with encephalitis caused by HSV may have an easier recovery than other people. Your level of inflammation. High levels of brain inflammation can cause more long-term issues that complicate your recovery. Your age. Adults may have a harder time recovering from encephalitis. Your overall health. If you have preexisting health issues or a weakened immune system, it can make your recovery more difficult. How long it took you to be diagnosed. The longer it takes you to get treatment, the higher your chance of having a difficult recovery and lasting complications. Takeaways Encephalitis is a condition that involves inflammation and swelling in your brain. It's usually caused by infection with a virus, especially HSV. It isn’t always preventable, but you can lower your risk by avoiding infection with a germ that could lead to encephalitis. This means getting your recommended vaccines and avoiding or protecting yourself when in areas that have ticks and mosquitoes. If you have signs or symptoms of encephalitis, you should get to the doctor right away. Quick diagnosis and treatment can make your recovery easier and limit lasting effects. Although some people do experience complications, most people fully recover. Encephalitis FAQs What is the life expectancy of people with encephalitis? Most people fully recover from encephalitis and go on to live a normal life. People with mild cases may recover in a week, while people with serious cases may have complications that take months of added recovery time. One study showed that about 5% of people who are hospitalized with encephalitis die while they are in the hospital. Can encephalitis resolve on its own? If you have mild encephalitis, it can recover on its own over several weeks. Severe cases of encephalitis, however, can be life-threatening. You can't necessarily tell from your symptoms how serious your case is, so if you suspect you have encephalitis, you need to go to the doctor."
84,Sunburn,"Despite health warnings about sun damage, many of us still subject our skin to the sun's burning rays. More than a third of adults and nearly 70% of children admit they've gotten sunburned within the past year, according to the CDC. Years of getting too much sun can lead to early wrinkling and age spots, and it makes you more likely to get skin cancer. You can have a strategy for keeping your skin safe and find sunburn relief if you linger on your lounger too long. A sunburn is skin damage from the sun's ultraviolet (UV) rays. Most are mild and can be treated at home. But sunburn also increases your risk of melanoma and other skin cancers. Photo credit:John White Photos / Getty Images What Causes Sunburn? You already know the simple explanation behind sunburn. When your skin is exposed to the sun for a period of time, eventually it burns, turning red and irritated. Under the skin, things get a little more complicated. The sun gives off three wavelengths of ultraviolet light: UVA UVB UVC UVC light doesn't reach the Earth's surface. The other two types of ultraviolet light not only reach your beach towel, but they penetrate your skin. Skin damage is caused by UVA and UVB rays. Sunburn may be the most obvious sign that you've been sitting outside for too long. But sun damage isn't always visible. Under the surface, ultraviolet light can alter your DNA, prematurely aging your skin. Over time, DNA damage can contribute to skin cancers, including deadly melanoma. How soon a sunburn begins depends on: Your skin type The sun's intensity How long you're exposed to the sun While people with lighter skin tend to get sunburned more quickly, brown and Black skin can also burn. Sunburns may be harder to see on darker skin. But they still cause damage like wrinkles and hyperpigmentation – and raise your risk of skin cancer. What Are the Signs of Sunburn? When you get a sunburn, your skin hurts and may look red, depending on your skin tone. If the burn is severe, you can have swelling and sunburn blisters. You may even feel like you have the flu – feverish, with chills, nausea , a headache, and weakness. A few days later, your skin will start peeling and itching as your body tries to rid itself of sun-damaged cells. How to Get Relief From Sunburn Sunburn treatment is designed to attack the burn on two fronts – relieving reddened, inflamed skin while easing pain. A few home remedies for sunburn are: Compresses. Apply cold compresses to your skin or take a cool bath to soothe the burn. Most sunburns cause mild pain and redness but affect only the outer layer of skin (first-degree burn). Photo credit: iStock/Getty  Images Creams or gels. To take the sting out of your sunburn, gently rub on a cream or gel containing ingredients such as: Menthol Camphor Aloe – Use 90% aloe vera gel or the juice squeezed directly from the aloe plant. Every tropical culture uses aloe vera as a treatment for sunburn . It soothes damaged skin because it is anti-inflammatory and may prevent the burn from deepening. If you don't have any of these, apply a moisturizing lotion that doesn't contain alcohol. Refrigerating the cream first will make it feel even better on your sunburned skin. NSAIDs. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, like ibuprofen or naproxen, can relieve sunburn swelling and pain all over your body. Stay hydrated. Drink plenty of water and other fluids so that you don't become dehydrated. Avoid the sun. Until your sunburn heals, stay out of the sun. You may be able to treat the sunburn yourself. But call a doctor if you notice any of these more serious sunburn signs: A fever of 102 F or higher Chills Severe pain A headache Sunburn blisters that cover 20% or more of your body, such as your entire chest and belly A dry mouth, thirst, reduced urination, dizziness, and fatigue, which are signs of dehydration Also, if you notice any mark, bump, blemish, or mole that is changing, growing, or bleeding, call your doctor. It may be skin cancer, which is often treatable when it's found early. How Can You Prevent Sunburn? Some ways to keep your skin safe when you're outside are: Watch the clock. The sun's rays are strongest between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. If you can't stay indoors during that block of time, at least stick to shady spots. Wear the right clothes. When you have to be outdoors, wear sun-protective clothing, such as: A broad-brimmed hat A long-sleeved shirt and pants UV-blocking sunglasses Use sunscreen. Cover any exposed areas of skin liberally with at least 1 ounce of broad-spectrum sunscreen. That means sunscreen that protects against UVA and UVB rays. The sunscreen should have an SPF (sun protection factor) of at least 30. Follow these tips for applying sunscreen: Apply sunscreen about 30 minutes before you go outside. Use sunscreen even on overcast days, because UV rays can penetrate clouds. Reapply sunscreen every 2 hours – or more often if you're sweating heavily or swimming. If you wear makeup, apply sunscreen first and then put on your foundation. By itself, foundation doesn’t have the broad-spectrum sunscreen that you need, even if it does have some sunscreen in it. Talk to your doctor. Discuss any medications you take. Some antibiotics, antidepressants , and diabetes drugs can make skin more sensitive to sun. Some drugs that you put on your skin, including Renova and Retin-A, can make your skin very sensitive and cause it to burn quickly. If you use these treatments, ask your doctor how to protect your skin from the sun."
85,Septic Arthritis,"Septic arthritis is also known as infectious arthritis , and is usually caused by bacteria. It can also be caused by a virus or fungus. The condition is an inflammation of a joint that's caused by infection. Typically, septic arthritis affects one large joint in the body, such as the knee or hip. Less frequently, septic arthritis can affect multiple joints. What Causes Septic Arthritis? Septic arthritis usually is caused by bacteria that spread through the blood stream from another area of the body. It can also be caused by a bacterial infection from an open wound or an opening from a surgical procedure, such as knee surgery. In adults and children, common bacteria that cause acute septic arthritis include staphylococcus and streptococcus. Among young, sexually active adults, neisseria gonorrhoeae is the most common pathogen for the condition. These foreign invaders enter the bloodstream and infect the joint, causing inflammation and pain. Other infections, such as those caused by viruses and fungi, can also cause arthritis. Viruses include: Hepatitis A, B, and C Parvovirus B19 HIV (AIDS virus) HTLV-1 Adenovirus Coxsackie viruses Mumps Alphaviruses Flaviviruses Fungi that can cause arthritis include histoplasma, coccidioides, and blastomyces. These infections are usually slower to develop than bacterial infections . Who's at Risk for Septic Arthritis? Young children and elderly adults are most likely to develop septic arthritis. People with open wounds are also at a higher risk for septic arthritis. In addition, people with a weakened immune system and those with pre-existing conditions such as cancer , diabetes, intravenous drug abuse, and immune deficiency disorders have a higher risk of septic arthritis. In addition, previously damaged joints have an increased likelihood of becoming infected. What Are the Symptoms of Septic Arthritis? Symptoms of septic arthritis usually come on rapidly with intense pain, joint swelling , and fever. Septic arthritis symptoms may include: Chills Fatigue and generalized weakness Fever Inability to move the limb with the infected joint Severe pain in the affected joint, especially with movement Swelling (increased fluid within the joint) Warmth (the joint is red and warm to touch because of increased blood flow) How Is Septic Arthritis Diagnosed? A procedure called arthrocentesis is commonly used to make an accurate diagnosis of septic arthritis. This procedure involves a surgical puncture of the joint to draw a sample of the joint fluid, known as synovial fluid. Normally, this fluid is sterile and acts as a lubricant. During arthrocentesis, a needle is inserted into the affected joint to collect fluid from the joint. The fluid sample is sent to a lab for evaluation. The lab will perform a white cell count on the fluid, which will usually be very high. The lab will also try to culture bacteria or other organisms. This will help the doctor determine if an infection is present and which organism is causing it. X-rays are typically done to look for joint damage . Blood tests can also be used to monitor inflammation. MRI scanning is sensitive in evaluating joint destruction but is less useful in the early stages. Blood tests can also be taken to detect and monitor inflammation. What's the Treatment for Septic Arthritis? Septic arthritis treatments include using a combination of powerful antibiotics as well as draining the infected synovial fluid from the joint. It's likely that antibiotics will be administered immediately to avoid the spread of the infection. Intravenous (IV) antibiotics are given, usually requiring admission to the hospital for initial treatment. The treatment, however, may be continued on an outpatient basis at home with the assistance of a home health nursing service. Initially, empiric antibiotics are chosen to cover a wide range of infections. If the bacteria can be identified, antibiotics specific to that organism are used. It may take four to six weeks of treatment with antibiotics to ensure complete eradication of the infectious agents. Is the Infected Fluid Drained? Drainage of the infected area is critical for rapid clearing of the infection. Drainage is performed by removing the fluid with a needle and syringe. Often the draining occurs daily or with multiple surgical procedures. The exact method depends on the location of the joint. Using arthroscopy , your doctor can irrigate the joint and remove the infected tissue. If drainage cannot be accomplished with joint aspirations or arthroscopy, open joint surgery is often necessary to drain the joint. If the fluid buildup is significant, the drains are left in place to remove excess fluid that may build up after the surgery."
86,Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT): What Is It?,"What Is Supraventricular Tachycardia? Supraventricular tachycardia is when your heart beats faster than normal when you're at rest. Photo credit: (Natthawut Thongchomphoonuch/Dreamstime) Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is a type of arrhythmia, or an irregular heartbeat, where your heart beats erratically or fast. Also called paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, SVT affects the upper chambers of your heart. The name is from Latin. Supraventricular means ""above the ventricles,"" which are the lower two sections of your heart. Tachycardia, pronounced (tack-eh-CARD-ee-uh), is what doctors call a fast heartbeat. Bouts of SVT can last from a few seconds to a few hours, and your heart can beat as fast as 220 times a minute. During an episode, you might have a drop in blood pressure and feel dizzy or lightheaded. Other times, the only thing you feel is your rapid heartbeat. SVT usually doesn't cause serious health problems, but you should see your doctor if you have symptoms. SVT vs. VTACH People sometimes confuse SVT with a similar condition called ventricular tachycardia (VTACH). VTACH is also a type of an irregular heartbeat. But it starts in your heart's ventricles, which are the lower two chambers, instead of your heart's atria, the upper two chambers. VTACH is more common in older people with underlying heart issues. Usually, SVT isn't as serious as VTACH. Who does SVT affect? SVT usually affects younger people. It often starts when you're in your teens or early 20s. But young children, middle-aged people, or older people can also have SVT. SVT is more common in women or those assigned female at birth, especially during pregnancy. How Does Your Heart Beat? Your heart is a muscular organ that pumps about 2,000 gallons of blood a day to send oxygen-rich blood to your body. It has four pumping chambers to do the job: the left and right atria at the top and the left and right ventricles on the bottom. Your heart also has something of a natural pacemaker . It's called the sinoatrial node or SA node. It's at the top of your heart and sends electrical signals that keep it beating the right way. The electrical signal from the SA node makes the muscles of the upper two chambers squeeze, pumping blood into the lower two chambers. Then the signal moves down and causes the muscles of the lower two chambers to squeeze. That sends blood to your body. The heart beats like this in a familiar ""lub-dub"" pattern some 50-99 times a minute if you're at rest. The heartbeat normally raises and drops in speed based on signals that get sent to the SA node. During a bout of SVT, these signals don't happen normally. The electrical signals in the upper chambers fire off early, causing them to squeeze too soon. That interrupts the main electrical signal coming from the SA node. This makes the heart beat very quickly and irregularly. Types of SVT There are a few types of SVT : Atrioventricular (AV) nodal reentrant tachycardia: This is the most common form, especially among young women. If you have it, there's an extra pathway in your heart near the AV node . This pathway, known as a reentrant circuit, causes an electrical signal to circle around and around instead of moving down to your heart's lower chambers. This triggers the sudden, rapid heartbeat. AV reciprocating tachycardia: This happens when you have an abnormal pathway linking your heart's upper and lower chambers causing the signal to move around and around in a big loop. This type of SVT is more common in younger people. It also affects people with an inherited condition called Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome . Atrial tachycardia: This happens when a short circuit in your heart's right or left atrium triggers a faulty electrical signal. It usually affects people who have heart disease. Sinus tachycardia: This is when your heart beats quickly but at a normal rhythm. A fast heartbeat is normal with exercise or stress but shouldn't happen when you're resting. Causes of this type of SVT include certain medications, illegal drugs, fever, pain, and some medical conditions. If a faster heartbeat doesn't go away when the stressful situation ends or you stop exercising, talk with your doctor. Sinus tachycardia usually isn't dangerous, but your doctor can rule out more serious heart-related issues. Paroxysmal SVT: "" Paroxysmal "" means that something happens in occasional bursts. This type of SVT usually affects young people who do engage in intense exercise. Other tachycardia There are several other types of tachycardia, including : Sinus nodal reentrant tachycardia Junctional ectopic tachycardia Nonparoxysmal junctional tachycardia Premature atrial contractions Accessory pathway tachycardias such as Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome Multifocal atrial tachycardia Atrial fibrillation Atrial flutter SVT Causes SVT is usually caused by things you can't control, such as a medical condition or previous surgery. Sometimes, an episode is triggered by stress, exercise, or lack of sleep, though it usually happens without any obvious reason. Medical conditions Health conditions that can cause your heart to race include: Lung disease Thyroid disease Heart failure or other heart disease Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome Certain medications Some medications for asthma, allergies, and colds can affect your heartbeat. Talk with your doctor if you're concerned that your medications might be causing SVT episodes. Congenital issues "" Congenital "" means something that you're born with. Some people are born with an extra electrical pathway or abnormal electrical circuits in their heart that can cause arrhythmias like SVT. Heart surgery If you've had heart surgery, scar tissue can change how electrical signals pass through your heart. Other things that can trigger SVT Your heart is more likely to race when you: Are under a lot of stress Have anxiety Drink a lot of caffeine and alcohol Smoke or use tobacco Abuse drugs like cocaine or methamphetamine, also called crystal meth Are pregnant SVT Risk Factors You're at a high risk of some types of SVT if you're middle-aged or older and when you're pregnant. Several health conditions raise your risk, including: Heart disease (coronary artery disease, heart failure, disease of the heart muscle or valve) Lung disease Thyroid disease Diabetes Sleep apnea Smoking and using illicit drugs are also risk factors for SVT. SVT Symptoms During SVT, you might have a rapid heartbeat or heart palpitations (feeling like your heart is pounding or fluttering). When your heart beats too fast, it doesn't have time to fully refill with blood between beats. That means it can't send enough blood to your body. This can cause: Chest pain Dizziness Fatigue Shortness of breath Fainting Sweating Weakness A pounding feeling in the neck Rarely, SVT can cause unconsciousness or cardiac arrest. And sometimes, SVT doesn't cause any symptoms. It might be harder to notice symptoms in young children. In infants, look for sweating, pale skin, fast pulse , vomiting, and poor feeding. If you feel like your heart is fluttering and you have any of these symptoms, call your doctor to be tested for SVT. SVT Diagnosis and Tests If you have symptoms, your doctor will ask you detailed questions. They'll want to know how old you were when you first noticed a problem. They'll also ask when and how your symptoms began. That includes whether you were exercising when you noticed things such as a rapid pulse, dizziness , or a hard time breathing. Other things they'll ask you about: Whether your symptoms came on suddenly or slowly What they feel like and how long they last If you have a fast heartbeat after caffeine or stress If you or anyone in your family has had heart problems or procedures During your exam, your doctor will listen to your heart and lungs with a stethoscope. They might also: Feel your thyroid gland on your neck Get your temperature and measure your blood pressure Take a small blood sample with a thin needle Electrocardiogram (EKG) test If your doctor suspects you have SVT, they want you to have an EKG . This test records your heart's rhythm over time, so if it's not beating as it should, it can tell your doctor what the problem is. To set up the test, a nurse or technician will attach six sticky patches that stick to you skin called electrodes on your chest and others on your arms and legs. If you have a hairy chest, an aide may need to shave small areas so they stay on. Each patch is attached to a wire that leads to a machine. During the short test, you'll be asked to lie still and breathe normally. Home monitoring You might have symptoms just once in a while, so a single EKG in the doctor's office may not reveal an abnormal heart rate. In these cases, you might need to wear a device for longer so doctors can record your heart while you're having symptoms. You may be sent home with one of the following: A Holter monitor is a small, battery-powered EKG that records your heart's activity for 24-48 hours. The device is about the size of a small camera and has little electrodes that are placed on your chest. You can do most of your daily activities, but you shouldn't bathe or shower with it on. An event monitor is also a portable EKG but might be more practical when you have symptoms less than once a day. You can wear it for longer than a Holter. You just press a button on the device when you're having symptoms. The monitor records details only while you feel a fast heartbeat. Your doctor may ask you to wear it for days or weeks. Further tests If you're diagnosed based on the results of an EKG, you may need more tests to figure out what type of SVT you have and what's causing it. Often, this can include what's called an ""electrophysiology study"" so that doctors can learn how the different sections of your heart are sending electrical signals to each other. For this test, you're sedated at a hospital or clinic and soft, flexible wires are passed through your veins into your heart. You'll need someone to drive you to and from your appointment. Talk to your doctor about how to prepare. Doctors might also recommend more testing, such as an echocardiogram, an implanted loop recorder, or a stress test. An echocardiogram uses sound waves to create a video of your heartbeat. A doctor implants a loop recorder below the skin of your chest to listen for unusual heart rhythms. During a stress test, you run on a treadmill or take medicine to make your heart speed up. While this happens, the doctor monitors your heartbeat. SVT Treatment Usually, SVT doesn't require any treatment. If it bothers you, your doctor can choose from among several different treatments. They include: Carotid sinus massage A carotid sinus massage is when your doctor rubs your neck along your carotid artery, which causes your heart to slow down. Only experienced professionals should do this. Never try it on your own. Vagal maneuvers Sometimes, certain actions can relieve SVT. Try coughing, holding your breath, putting an ice pack on your face, or pushing as if you're about to poop. These can calm the vagus nerve , which runs from the lower part of your brain through your neck to your stomach and controls your heart rate. Your doctor can show you how to do these maneuvers safely. Medications Some medications can help keep your heartbeat under control. If you regularly have episodes of SVT, your doctor might prescribe: Adenosine (Adenocard) Atropine (AtroPen) Beta-blockers Calcium channel blockers Digoxin (Digitek) Potassium channel blockers Follow your doctor's directions for taking each medication, and talk with them about potential side effects. Cardioversion In an emergency, a doctor can place a set of paddles or patches on your chest to deliver an electric shock to your heart. This helps your heartbeat return to normal. Catheter ablation For this treatment, doctors thread tiny tubes (called catheters ) through a vein to your heart. These release a pulse of heat or cold that destroys the abnormal electrical pathway that causes SVT. Pacemaker In rare cases, a surgeon can put a tiny device called a pacemaker in your chest. When your heart isn't beating normally, this device delivers a small shock to help it return to its regular rhythm. Lifestyle and Home Remedies When you have SVT, it's important to take care of your heart. Make sure to visit your doctor regularly. They can prescribe medications and recommend healthy habits to help manage blood pressure , cholesterol, and other issues that affect your heart. Some healthy lifestyle habits include: Stick to a heart-healthy diet . Include plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Drink enough water . Dehydration can trigger SVT. Exercise . Try walking, swimming, gardening, or other forms of physical activity. Talk with your doctor about finding a routine that's right for you. Don't smoke . Don't be afraid to ask for help with quitting. Find your healthy weight . Talk with your doctor about how to maintain a weight that's right for you. Avoid alcohol . If you drink, do it in moderation: 1-2 drinks a day for most people, depending on your weight and age. Limit coffee or tea . Moderate amounts are usually harmless, but avoid drinking too much. Don't do illegal drugs . Cocaine, methamphetamines, and other drugs can trigger an irregular heartbeat. Talk with your doctor about getting help. Manage stress . Try coping strategies like yoga, meditation, or mindfulness. Get enough sleep . This helps some people to avoid SVT. Foods to avoid with SVT Some foods and beverages can trigger SVT episodes and raise your risk of other heart issues. Along with caffeine and alcohol, consider avoiding those that contain a lot of: Salt Saturated fat Sugar Carbohydrates SVT Complications SVT is usually not life-threatening. But in rare cases, it can make you faint or even cause a cardiac arrest. Eventually, too many bouts of SVT can weaken your heart. That's especially true if you also have other health conditions. Some SVT treatments, including medications and ablation, can cause side effects. Talk with your doctor about managing these complications. SVT Prevention The best way to avoid SVT is to adopt a heart-healthy lifestyle. If you already have SVT, try to identify what triggers your irregular heartbeat. Keep a diary of your episodes. Write down your heart rate, symptoms, and activities that might have caused the SVT (such as drinking coffee or smoking a cigarette). Over time, this will help you identify patterns and take steps to avoid these triggers. If your doctor has prescribed medication for SVT, take it exactly as directed. When Should I See the Doctor? If this is your first time having an irregular heartbeat or the episode lasts more than a few seconds, call your doctor. When should I go to the ER for SVT? Get medical help immediately if you have sudden chest pain and are short of breath or if you've been diagnosed with SVT and your heart has been racing for 30 minutes or more. SVT Takeaways SVT is when you have a fast or an erratic heartbeat. It can be caused by faulty electrical signals in your heart or by stress exercise, and other triggers. SVT isn't life-threatening, and most people don't need treatment. If you do, you can control it with medication and lifestyle changes. SVT FAQs Is SVT life-threatening? SVT is rarely life-threatening. But untreated episodes can weaken your heart and could cause heart failure, especially if you already have other medical or heart problems. When should I be concerned about SVT? Call 911 if your rapid heartbeat doesn't return to normal after a few minutes. Also call 911 if you have chest pain, trouble breathing, or you feel dizzy or weak."
87,What Happens in Surgery,"As your surgery date gets closer, you might feel uneasy. But the more you know about what to expect, the less nervous you'll be. Take a few minutes to learn how the day will unfold. What Happens When I Get to the Hospital You'll usually be asked to arrive about 2 hours before your surgery starts. A registered nurse will greet you and help you prep. You'll discuss your medical history and any medicines you take with your medical team. You'll also talk to your surgical team about the operation. Before you go to the operating room, you'll change into a gown. The nurse will remind you to remove things like jewelry, glasses or contact lenses, hearing aids, or a wig if you have it. A nurse checks your heart rate , temperature, blood pressure, and pulse. The surgeon may mark the spot on your body where the procedure will be done. A nurse places an IV line in your arm so the doctor can give you fluids and medicine during your procedure. When it's time for your surgery, you're wheeled into the operating room on a stretcher. Who Will Be on My Surgical Team? A group of doctors and nurses work together to make sure everything goes smoothly. The specific people on your surgical team will depend on the type of procedure you're going to have. But in general, your team will have these pros: Surgeon. This doctor leads the team and performs the operation. Surgeons have to complete 4 years of medical school, plus at least 5 years of special training. They also have to pass a national surgical board exam. The surgeon you choose should be experienced in the type of procedure you're having. Anesthesiologist. This doctor gives you medicine that makes you pain-free during surgery. Certified registered nurse anesthetist. They assist your anesthesiologist and monitor you before, during, and after your operation to make sure you get the right amount of pain medicine. Surgical tech. They set up the tools your surgeon will use and make sure the tools are sterile. Operating room nurse. These nurses assist the surgeon during your procedure. For instance, they may pass instruments and supplies during the operation. Will I Be in Any Pain During the Operation? You'll get medicine, called anesthesia , so that you won't feel anything during surgery. The type of anesthesia you get depends on your health and the procedure you're having. Local anesthesia. It blocks pain only to the part of your body where you have surgery. You'll still be awake and alert. Regional anesthesia. You're injected with medicine that numbs a large area of your body where the surgery takes place. IV-monitored sedation. This is used for minimally invasive procedures and less complex and short surgeries — like colonoscopies or biopsies — where local anesthesia isn't sufficient and general anesthesia isn't required. General anesthesia. It puts you to sleep during your operation. It's used for major surgeries. You get this type of medicine through an IV line or by breathing into a mask. What Will Happen During My Surgery? Once you're in the operating room, you breathe oxygen through a mask. Your anesthesiologist gives you medicine to prevent pain. Your surgical team will track your health during the entire procedure. They'll probably use: A clip on your finger to measure your oxygen levels A cuff on your arm to monitor your blood pressure Pads on your chest to keep tabs on your heart rate How Will My Surgical Team Keep Me From Getting an Infection? Before the surgery starts, a nurse cleans your skin with an antiseptic to help prevent infections. They may remove hair from the area and place a sterile drape over your body. It will have an opening in the place where the surgeon will work. It's rare to get an infection during surgery. Your team does everything it can to protect you. Your doctors and nurses will: Clean their hands and arms up to their elbows with a germ-killing cleaner before the operation. Wear masks, gowns, and gloves. Clean the part of your body where the surgery is being done with a germ-killing soap. Clean and cover your incision afterward. They may also give you antibiotics before your procedure to help prevent an infection . Where Will I Go After My Surgery? You'll wake up in a recovery room. A nurse checks your heart rate, breathing, and the bandaged incision. They might also ask you to take deep breaths and cough to clear your lungs. You'll stay in the recovery room until you're fully awake and all your medical signs, like blood pressure and heart rate, are stable. How much time you spend there depends on what kind of surgery you had. After that, depending on the type of operation you had, you'll be sent to a hospital room or will be able to go home. Hospital Risks After Surgery Complications after surgery are always possible. But your surgical team will do everything they can to help you avoid them. Here are some potential risks you may face when you're in the hospital after surgery: Medication errors Getting the wrong medication, or the wrong amount of medication, is one of the most serious possible risks when you're in the hospital. The FDA gets more than 100,000 reports each year of suspected medication errors. To reduce your risk of getting the wrong medications, make sure everyone on your medical team — your doctor, surgeon, and everyone else involved in your care — knows every medicine you take. That includes prescriptions, over-the-counter drugs, and supplements. After surgery, ask questions about any new medications you're given. Always make sure your nurse compares your ID bracelet to the name on the prescription. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and other hospital-acquired infections Another risk when you're in the hospital after surgery is infection. According to the CDC, 1 in 31 hospital patients have at least one hospital-acquired infection at any time. One of the worst is MRSA, which is a type of staph infection resistant to many antibiotics . To prevent the spread of MRSA, ask your doctor if you'll be getting antibiotics before and after surgery. After your operation, be sure everybody coming in your room, including doctors, nurses, family, and friends, washes their hands before they touch you. Pneumonia Pneumonia is another common hospital-acquired infection, especially in those who spend time in the intensive care uni t or are on ventilators . You can get an infection if germs enter through the ventilator tube and into your lungs. You can also get pneumonia during your recovery because you're on your back and taking deep breaths is often painful. Some patients may also get atelectasis -- a partial collapse of the lung -- after anesthesia, prolonged bed rest, and shallow breathing. You can reduce your risk of pneumonia with deep breathing. Try to take 10-15 big breaths every hour. And quit smoking at least 1 or 2 weeks before surgery if you're a smoker. Aspiration pneumonia is a bit different. It's an infection of your lungs that's caused by breathing in fluids, like food, liquid, or vomit. It can also happen if you've had anesthesia because you can't cough. The best way to avoid aspiration pneumonia is to follow your doctor's orders about not eating or drinking before surgery. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) DVT is when a blood clot develops, usually deep in the veins of one of your legs. If the clot breaks free and travels through your bloodstream, it can get lodged in the arteries of your lungs, cutting off the blood's supply of oxygen. This is called pulmonary embolism, and it can be fatal. After surgery, your risk of DVT increases because you're often immobile in bed, making your blood more likely to pool and clot in your legs. The trauma of surgery itself also increases your blood's tendency to clot. Walking as much as possible, using leg compression devices, and taking blood thinners if your doctor prescribes them are all ways you can prevent DVT in the hospital after surgery. Bleeding after surgery Uncontrolled bleeding after surgery is not as much of a problem as it once was, thanks to advances in surgical techniques. But it can still happen. Your doctor should know about all your medications, but if you take even an aspirin or ibuprofen within a few days of your procedure, alert your medical team. Common drugs can thin your blood. Also, tell your doctor if you've ever had excessive bleeding before, even for something like a dental procedure. Anesthesia complications You might worry about complications from anesthesia, but general anesthesia is very safe. Most people, even those with health issues, don't have problems. If you or a family member has ever had a bad reaction to anesthesia, make sure your doctor knows. Older patients might be confused after surgery while the anesthesia wears off. And some people might have minor side effects like nausea , vomiting, dry mouth, and itching. Speaking up lowers hospital risks When you're in the hospital, it's easy to feel intimidated or even scared. But don't give up your control. You're your best advocate when it comes to your health care. Pay attention and ask questions if there's anything that concerns you or you don't understand."
88,What Is Sweet Syndrome?,"You’ve been running a fever for the past few days. Now, you have a bumpy rash that’s spreading fast and it hurts. These symptoms can point to a number of health conditions, including one you may never have heard of: Sweet syndrome. Usually, this rare skin condition (also known as acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis) isn’t serious and clears up without treatment. But it can be triggered by another health problem, such as an infection or possibly cancer. It’s not contagious, so you can’t catch it from -- or give it to -- someone. Sweet syndrome is a rare autoinflammatory skin disorder characterized by a fever and sudden outbreak of a rash with multiple lesions. These lesions are tender, red or bluish-red bumps and can occur anywhere on the body. In some cases, internal organs can be affected, and the musculoskeletal system can become involved resulting in swollen joints. There are several possible causes for Sweet syndrome including infection, malignancy, pregnancy, and drug exposure. It is usually treated with corticosteroids. Middle-aged women are most likely to get it. But men and even babies can get it. Symptoms The biggest sign is the rash that seems to appear out of nowhere a few days or weeks after a fever. Small red or purple bumps or lumps typically show up first on your arms, legs, face, or neck. But they can pop up in other places, too. They tend to grow quickly and eventually join together to make large patches. The rash can be painful. You may get blisters or pimple-like bumps. They can break open and become infected. In addition to fever and rash, other symptoms include: Feeling like you have the flu Feeling tired Headaches Joint pain Mouth sores Pink eye Causes Most of the time, it happens on its own and doctors can’t find a reason. Other times, it happens when your immune system reacts to another problem, like: Blood cancer such as leukemia or lymphoma Bowel disease, like ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease Chest infection or strep throat Colon or breast cancer Injury where the rash is, like a needle prick or insect bite Pregnancy Rheumatoid arthritis A reaction from a drug also can bring on Sweet syndrome. Possible drugs include common ones such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( Advil , Motrin ). But a medication called granulocyte-colony stimulating factor that’s used to help fight infections in some people with cancer is the most common culprit. Diagnosis Your doctor might be able to tell that it’s Sweet syndrome just by looking at your rash. But you’ll probably have tests to rule out other conditions or look for what might be causing the problem. These include: Skin biopsy : A small sample of the rash is taken and looked at under the microscope for signs of Sweet syndrome. Blood tests: Your doctor may look for a large number of white blood cells called neutrophils or other signs of a blood disorder . If your doctor thinks another condition might be causing the problem, they also might recommend imaging tests like X-rays or a computerized tomography (CT) scan. That involves X-rays taken from different angles and then put together for a more complete picture. Treatment Sweet syndrome can go away by itself without treatment if it’s not caused by another health condition. But this could take weeks or months. Corticosteroid pills can help with redness, itching , swelling, and allergic reactions. Steroid creams or gels also may help -- especially with smaller lumps -- and can ease pain, too. If you have very painful or swollen lumps, your doctor might put steroids directly into them. If cancer or another health problem is causing your Sweet syndrome, treating it can clear your skin. If it’s caused by a drug, the rash probably will go away when you stop taking it. Most of the time, the rash heals well without leaving scars unless you had open sores. But your skin may be a different color for months afterward. Sweet syndrome may come back after treatment -- that’s more likely if cancer caused it. Its return may mean your cancer has come back if it was in remission (you no longer had any cancer cells). See your doctor right away if you notice symptoms again."
89,Swollen Lymph Nodes,"What Are Swollen Lymph Nodes? Swollen lymph nodes are a sign that your body is fighting off an infection or an illness. Most of the time, they return to normal size when their job is done. Lymph nodes are round, bean-shaped glands, and you have them throughout your body. You can sometimes feel these clusters as little bumps, especially in case of lymphadenopathy or swollen glands. They're part of your lymphatic system. Along with your spleen , tonsils , and adenoids , they help protect you from harmful germs. The job of a lymph node is to filter out what's in your lymph fluid as it drains from your cells to your tissues. Lymph fluid contains nutrients, fats, minerals, proteins, and more. The cells in your lymph nodes get rid of anything dangerous in the lymph fluid such as bacteria or viruses, keeping you healthy. Lymph node locations You have around 600 lymph nodes in your body. You might be most familiar with the ones in your neck, called cervical lymph nodes. But t here are also clusters of them in places such as your armpits and in the crease between your thigh and torso (where your leg begins). Some are in areas you can feel through the skin, but others are buried much deeper. Swollen lymph nodes are a sign your body is fighting off illness or infection. (Photo Credit: E+ / Getty Images) Symptoms of Swollen Lymph Nodes The most common signs of swollen lymph nodes are: Lymph nodes that feel like they're the size of a kidney bean or larger Tenderness or pain in your lymph nodes Because swollen lymph nodes are usually linked to some type of illness, you might also have other symptoms, depending on what that illness is: Runny nose, sore throat, or fever (caused by an upper respiratory infection) Swelling of clusters of lymph nodes in different places in your body (caused by an infection or an immune system disorder, such as rheumatoid arthritis ) Hard lymph nodes that won’t move or get bigger quickly (signs of certain types of cancer) Causes of Swollen Lymph Nodes Lymph nodes contain immune cells called lymphocytes. These cells attack bacteria, viruses, and other things that can make you sick. When you're fighting off harmful germs, your body makes more of those immune cells. That causes the swelling. Your lymph nodes come across all kinds of germs, so they can be swollen for lots of reasons. Usually, it's something that's relatively easy to treat, such as: A virus, such as a cold A bacterial infection, such as an ear infection, skin infection, or infected tooth Strep throat Measles Mono Much less often, it can be a more serious illness. They can include: Tuberculosis , an infection that usually affects your lungs Lyme disease , an infection spread through tick bites A problem with your immune system , such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis HIV /AIDS, an infection spread through sexual contact and IV drug use Certain kinds of cancer , including: Lymphoma , a cancer of the lymphatic system Leukemia , a cancer of the blood When to See a Doctor for Swollen Lymph Nodes In most cases, swollen glands return to normal size after the illness or infection has passed. But here are some things to watch for: Glands that swelled very suddenly Glands that are not just mildly swollen but much larger than usual Glands that feel hard or don't move when you push on them Glands that stay swollen for more than 5 days in children or 2-4 weeks in adults The area around the glands turns red or purple, it feels warm, or you see pus Swelling in your arm or groin Sudden weight loss A fever that doesn't go away Night sweats If you notice any of these symptoms, see your doctor. Swollen Lymph Nodes Diagnosis Your doctor will start by asking you about your medical history and giving you a physical exam. They might be able to get an idea of what's making your glands swell by where they are in your body. They also may recommend one of these tests to find out more about what's going on: Blood tests X-rays Ultrasound, in which high-frequency sound waves are used to let your doctor see what’s happening inside your body Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, where a powerful magnet and radio waves are used to make detailed images of your organs and tissues Biopsy , in which your doctor removes l ymph node tissue so it can be examined under a microscope PET scan , which looks at the chemical activity in parts of your body and may help identify a variety of conditions such as some cancers, heart disease, and brain disorders. (This is done less often.) CT scan , where a series of X-rays are taken from different angles and put together to form a more complete picture Home Remedies for Swollen Lymph Nodes If your swollen lymph nodes aren’t caused by something serious, they'll go away on their own. A few things may help with any discomfort while you wait for it to run its course: Warm compress. A washcloth rinsed in hot water and placed on the area that hurts may help ease pain. Rest. Getting lots of rest can help you get over a mild illness faster. Over-the-counter pain relievers. Acetaminophen, aspirin, ibuprofen, or naproxen may make you feel better. Talk to your doctor before giving aspirin to children or teenagers. Treatment for Swollen Lymph Nodes If something more serious is causing the swelling, treatment can include: Antibiotics for an infection caused by bacteria Medications that help with inflammation (for lupus and rheumatoid arthritis ) Surgery, radiation , or chemotherapy (for types of cancer) Takeaways You get swollen lymph nodes when your body is fighting off an infection or illness. Lymph nodes are part of your lymphatic system, which help make up your immune system. Your body contains about 600 of them. In most cases, the swelling will go down on its own. But if they're seriously swollen or aren't going down, call your doctor. Swollen Lymph Node FAQs Is lymph node swelling normal? Swollen lymph nodes are a sign that your body is fighting off an infection or illness. So most of the time, they're a sign that you're ill with something else. What do swollen lymph nodes feel like? The lymph nodes that you can feel may be a little painful, but most of the time, they just feel like soft, small balls. Do swollen lymph nodes mean COVID-19? This doesn't necessarily mean you have COVID-19, but you may. If you think you may have been exposed, you should take a test. Can you get swollen lymph nodes under your arm after the COVID-19 vaccine? Your lymph nodes swell when they're fighting an infection. So when you get the COVID-19 vaccine, it's possible your body will react similarly and the lymph nodes under the arm that was injected will swell temporarily."
90,What Is Symmastia? When Breasts Merge Into One,"Symmastia is when your breasts grow together, with little or no cleavage between them. Instead, there’s a web of skin , fat , and tissue across the cleavage area. There are different degrees of this condition. Sometimes the lack of cleavage is less noticeable. What Causes It? That depends on which type you have. Congenital symmastia. You’re born with this condition. It’s rare, and no one knows exactly what causes it. Acquired or iatrogenic. This type is still rare, but more common than the congenital kind. It’s usually a complication of breast reconstruction or augmentation surgery. It can happen when breast implants are too close together, especially if they’re too wide for you. There’s a higher risk if you’ve had several breast reconstruction surgeries already. Sometimes it results from an accidental cut during the implant process. Because there’s no natural space in your breast to hold an implant, surgeons have to create a pocket for it. They’ll probably use your own tissue from another body part. If that won’t work, they could try animal tissue, usually from a pig. The pocket should be the same size or slightly larger than the implant. If it’s too big and the doctor makes cuts the wrong way, the two pockets can join together to form one large open space. How Do You Treat It? Symmastia doesn’t usually cause any serious health problems. You may decide you want to fix it for cosmetic reasons, though. Many surgeries for both types involve reattaching skin to the breastbone to redefine the cleavage. Your surgeon may also have to create new pockets to hold implants or replace them with narrower ones. It’s possible to treat the congenital kind, but your surgeon has to fix both the structure and size of your breasts. Experts don’t agree on which type of surgery is best. Different operations may work better for different people. In general, you shouldn’t have surgery until your breasts have finished growing. One technique that has worked well for this type uses a three-step procedure. The first step uses liposuction or surgery to take out a small amount of breast tissue. Then, the surgeon attaches the skin at the cleavage area to the breastbone. Finally, they compress the area to help the skin and chest wall heal. You’ll also need to wear a compression bra for a while. Possible complications include scarring and breasts that aren’t the same size or shape. If you decide to have surgery, get a second opinion from another surgeon before you commit. When you pick a surgeon, make sure you choose one who’s already done a lot of similar procedures. Prevention If you want cosmetic breast surgery, there are steps you and your surgeon can take to make sure this condition doesn’t happen to you. Discuss the type and size of implant and if it’s suited to your body. Also make sure that your surgeon has done many similar surgeries before. This will lower the chances that they’ll make any mistakes."
91,Porphyria,"What Is Porphyria? Porphyria is a group of disorders that can cause nerve or skin problems . There's no cure, but you can get treatments that will help you manage your symptoms. If you have porphyria that affects your skin , you'll hear your doctor call it a ""cutaneous porphyria."" When the condition causes a problem with your nervous system , it's called ""acute porphyria."" Porphyria Causes No matter what kind of porphyria you have, it has the same root cause: a problem with how your body makes a substance called heme. Heme is part of the ""hemoglobin"" in your blood -- proteins that carry oxygen from the lungs to the rest of your body. Heme has iron and gives blood its red color. It's made in your liver and bone marrow -- the spongy center of your bones. A variety of enzymes play a role in the process. If you have porphyria, your body doesn't have enough of some of these enzymes. This shortage leads to a buildup of certain chemicals, called porphyrins, that help make heme. The type of porphyria you have is linked to the specific enzyme that your body lacks. Most types of porphyria are inherited. That means one or both of your parents passes a mutated gene to you that leads to the disease. One common type of cutaneous porphyria, known as porphyria cutanea tarda, is sometimes passed through genes but can also be what doctors call an ""acquired disease."" In that case, certain conditions or actions can trigger symptoms of porphyria. These triggers can be things like: Drinking alcohol Estrogen use by women Hepatitis C HIV Smoking Episodes of acute porphyria, which rarely happen before puberty , can be set off by taking some kinds of drugs , including: Barbiturates Sulfa antibiotics Birth control pills Seizure medicines Other things that might trigger acute porphyria are: Fasting Smoking Drinking alcohol Infections Menstrual hormones Stress Being in the sun Symptoms of Porphyria Symptoms are different depending on the type of porphyria. Symptoms of acute porphyria The symptoms of acute porphyria can develop quickly and last for days or weeks. You might have an imbalance of salt in your body along with this type of porphyria. The symptoms can include: Belly pain , often severe Chest pain Faster heart rate and higher blood pressure Limb and back pain Muscle weakness Tingling and loss of sensation Cramping Vomiting and constipation You may notice changes in your personality, or you may get depression or other mental disorders. You could also feel agitated, confused, or get seizures . Some complications you could get are: Long-term pain Kidney damage Liver cancer Symptoms of cutaneous porphyria Symptoms of cutaneous porphyria happen when your skin is in sunlight. The most commonly affected areas include the face and the back of the: Hands Forearms Ears Neck You may get symptoms on your skin such as: Blisters Itching Swelling Pain More hair growth Darkening and thickening Porphyria Diagnosis Doctors sometimes find it tricky to diagnose porphyria because the symptoms are similar to those of other diseases. If your doctor thinks you have it, they may order blood, urine , and stool tests to get a diagnosis. The best time for you to do these tests is when you have an outbreak of symptoms or around that time. Sometimes you'll get multiple tests to help your doctor figure out which specific type of porphyria you have. Your doctor may also suggest you get a genetic test. Since porphyria often runs in families, your doctor may recommend that others in your family get this test as well. Questions for your doctor What caused my porphyria? Which type do I have? What tests do I need? How can I avoid my triggers? Which treatments do you recommend? How can I protect my skin from the sun? Porphyria Treatment When you have an outbreak of acute porphyria symptoms, you may need to stay in the hospital. You'll get medicine for pain, nausea, and vomiting. Your doctor may prescribe givosiran (Givlaari), which helps reduce the toxins linked to the attacks. You may also need to get a type of sugar called glucose, which you might take by mouth or get put into your veins through an IV. Your doctor may also give you a shot of hemin ( Panhematin ). If you have cutaneous porphyria, your treatment will depend on the specific type of the disease you have and how severe your symptoms are. If you have porphyria cutanea tarda, your treatment might include: Regular removal of your blood to lower the amount of iron in your liver. This is called phlebotomy . Low doses of the antimalarial drug chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine Your doctor may suggest that you avoid anything that triggers an outbreak. They will also treat conditions you have that bring on porphyria, like HIV or hepatitis C. Doctors for porphyria There are many things you can do to prevent outbreaks and manage your symptoms. You will likely need care from a team of health care professionals. You might see: Hematologists, doctors who treat blood diseases Dermatologists, specialists in skin diseases Hepatologists, doctors who treat liver diseases Genetic counselors, who advise people about their risk for inherited diseases It may take time to find the right doctors, because porphyria is so rare. The American Porphyria Foundation (APF) can help you find a specialist in your area. Good nutrition is another important part of taking care of yourself when you have porphyria. Your doctor or dietitian will help you get the right balance of carbohydrates and nutrients in your meals. Porphyria Complications Complications of acute porphyria Acute porphyria can be life-threatening. Complications can include: Dehydration Breathing problems Seizures High blood pressure Chronic pain Chronic kidney failure Liver damage Complications of cutaneous porphyria Cutaneous porphyria can lead to permanent skin damage. Complications of it can include: Infection Discoloration Fragile skin Scars Porphyria Outlook How porphyria affects you depends on the type you have. Acute porphyria symptoms start quickly and last for a few days or weeks. Severe attacks of acute porphyria can sometimes cause nerve damage and muscle weakness that can take months to get better. Since cutaneous porphyria symptoms start when your skin is in sunlight, staying out of the sun will heal your skin and help prevent permanent damage. Porphyria is a chronic disease, which means symptoms come and go throughout your life. Avoiding your triggers will help prevent bouts of symptoms. Remember that everyone with porphyria is different. Some people have milder symptoms than others. Treatments can help you feel better and prevent complications. Keep in mind that researchers are always testing new treatments in clinical trials . Ask your doctor if you should consider joining one. Getting porphyria support When you're managing porphyria, just as with any other serious medical problem, it's important to reach out to family and friends. They can give you the emotional backing you need and also help with everyday tasks while you get treatment. Your medical team can also offer information and support. They may know about support groups that let you meet others with your condition. Also, check the website of the American Porphyria Foundation. The group hosts patient education sessions where you can learn more about managing your symptoms. It also offers support for caregivers."
92,Apert Syndrome,"Apert syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that causes abnormal development of the skull. Babies with Apert syndrome are born with a distorted shape of the head and face. Many children with Apert syndrome also have other birth defects. Apert syndrome has no cure, but surgery can help correct some of the problems that result. Causes of Apert Syndrome Apert syndrome is caused by a rare mutation on a single gene. This mutated gene is normally responsible for guiding bones to join together at the right time during development. In almost all cases, the Apert syndrome gene mutation seems to be random. Only about one in 65,000 babies is born with Apert syndrome. Apert Syndrome Symptoms The defective gene in babies with Apert syndrome allows the skull bones to fuse together prematurely, a process called craniosynostosis. The brain continues to grow inside the abnormal skull, putting pressure on the bones in the skull and face. The abnormal skull and facial growth in Apert syndrome produce its main signs and symptoms: A head that is long, with a high forehead Wide-set, bulging eyes , often with poorly-closing eyelids A sunken middle face Other Apert syndrome symptoms also result from the abnormal skull growth: Poor intellectual development (in some children with Apert syndrome) Obstructive sleep apnea Repeated ear or sinus infections Hearing loss Crowded teeth due to underdevelopment of the jaw Abnormal fusion of the bones of the hands and feet (syndactyly) -- with webbed or mitten-like hands or feet -- are also common Apert syndrome symptoms. Some children with Apert syndrome also have heart , gastrointestinal, or urinary system problems. Apert Syndrome Diagnosis Doctors often suspect Apert syndrome or another craniosynostosis syndrome at birth because of a newborn's appearance. Genetic testing can usually identify Apert syndrome or another cause of abnormal skull formation. Apert Syndrome Treatments Apert syndrome has no known cure. Surgery to correct the abnormal connections between bones is the main treatment for Apert syndrome. In general, surgery for Apert syndrome takes place in three steps: 1. Release of skull bone fusion (craniosynostosis release). A surgeon separates the abnormally fused skull bones and partially rearranges some of them. This surgery is usually performed when a child is between ages 6 and 8 months. 2. Midface advancement. As the child with Apert syndrome grows, the facial bones again become misaligned. A surgeon cuts the bones in the jaw and cheeks and brings them forward into a more normal position. This surgery may be done at any time between ages 4 and 12. Additional corrective surgery may be needed, especially when midface advancement is done at a young age. 3. Correction of wide-set eyes (hypertelorism correction). A surgeon removes a wedge of bone in the skull between the eyes. The surgeon brings the eye sockets closer together, and may adjust the jaw, too. Other Apert syndrome treatments include: Eyedrops during the day, with lubricating eye ointment at night; these drops can prevent the dangerous eye drying that can occur in Apert syndrome. Continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ); a child with Apert syndrome and obstructive sleep apnea may wear a mask at night, attached to a small machine. The machine delivers pressure that keeps the child's airways open during sleep. Antibiotics . Children with Apert syndrome are prone to ear and sinus infections caused by bacteria, requiring antibiotic therapy. Surgical tracheostomy, or placement of a breathing tube in the neck; this surgery may be done for children with severe obstructive sleep apnea due to Apert syndrome. Surgical placement of ear tubes (myringotomy), for children with repeated ear infections due to Apert syndrome Other surgeries may be beneficial for certain children with Apert syndrome, depending on their individual pattern of facial bone formation problems. Apert Syndrome Prognosis Children with Apert syndrome usually require surgery for release of the skull bones to allow a chance for the brain to develop normally. The older a child is before this surgery is performed, the lower the chance for reaching normal intellectual ability. Even with early surgery, certain brain structures may remain poorly developed, however. In general, children who are raised by their parents have a better chance of achieving normal intellectual ability. About four in 10 children with Apert syndrome who are raised in a healthy family environment reach a normal intelligence quotient (IQ). Among Apert syndrome children who are institutionalized, only about one in 18 achieves a normal IQ. In one study, three of 136 children with Apert syndrome eventually attended college. Children with Apert syndrome and other similar conditions who have normal IQs do not seem to have an increased risk of behavioral or emotional problems. However, they may require additional social and emotional support to help cope with their condition. Children with Apert syndrome with lower IQs often do have behavioral and emotional problems. There can be wide variability between children with Apert syndrome, with some severely affected, and others only mildly affected. Experts are unsure why the same gene mutation can result in such variation in a child's Apert syndrome prognosis. Life expectancy also varies between children with Apert syndrome. Those with Apert syndrome who survive past childhood and don't have heart problems likely have a normal or near-normal life expectancy. Life expectancy is likely improving because of advances in surgical techniques and follow-up care."
93,What Is Fournier’s Gangrene?,"What Is Fournier's Gangrene? Fournier’s gangrene is a very serious, sometimes fatal infection in your genital or anal area. It’s a type of necrotizing fasciitis (flesh-eating disease) that develops quickly. Gangrene happens when body tissue is dead or is dying because it’s infected or isn’t getting enough blood. Fournier’s gangrene usually involves an infection that gets under the skin of the scrotum (the sac holding the testicles), the penis, or the perineum. The perineum is the area between the penis and the anus or between the vulva (the outer part of the vagina) and the anus. Under the skin, the infection spreads quickly and starts to destroy soft tissues surrounding your muscles, arteries, and nerves. In the worst cases, the dead or dying tissue can stretch to the thighs, stomach, and chest. Is Fournier's gangrene an emergency? Yes, Fournier’s gangrene gets worse quickly and can kill you, so it’s always an emergency. Fournier’s gangrene can be caused by many types of bacteria, including E. coli. Other causes could include group A streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. (Photo Credit: Getty Images) How Common Is Fournier's Gangrene? The disease is very rare. About 1.6 per 100,000 men and many fewer women or children get it each year. One study that looked at 10.7 million hospitalized men and boys found 2,238 cases of Fournier’s gangrene. The same study found just 49 cases in more than 15 million hospitalized women and girls. Rates are highest in men over age 50. In the United States, it's most common in the South. It’s not clear how often people who get Fournier’s gangrene die from it. Some studies say the death rate could be as low as 7.5 %; most studies put the rate at 20% to 40%. Fournier's Gangrene Symptoms What does Fournier’s gangrene feel like? The first thing you might notice is sudden pain or tenderness in the genitals or the area between the genitals and the anus (the perineum). Then you might start to feel sick all over. For example, you might feel tired, sick to your stomach, and get a fever. What does Fournier’s gangrene look like? If you have Fournier's gangrene, the skin on the affected body parts changes color. First, it’s red or purple, then bluish gray and, finally, black. These changes may be hard to see if your skin is dark. Early symptoms of Fournier’s gangrene: Your penis, vulva, scrotum, or perineum looks red or purple. You feel sore around your genitals or in the area between your genitals and your anus. These areas might start to swell. If you have these early symptoms, call your doctor right away. Don’t wait to see if things get worse. Later symptoms of Fournier’s gangrene: These vary from person to person, but can include: Pain around the genitals or anus that gets worse Pain in your belly Color changes in the sore area A bad smell from the sore area Itchiness A popping sound when you rub the sore area Fever and chills A fast heart rate Low blood pressure Confusion Nausea and vomiting Low energy Fournier's Gangrene Causes Fournier’s gangrene usually involves an infection with bacteria. The bacteria can get into tissues under your skin in several ways. These include: Urinary tract infections Bladder infections Surgery Abscesses, infected wounds that drain pus. You can get these near the anus or vulva. Genital piercings Insect bites Injuries during sex Any injury that causes a scratch or burn Circumcision in children Causes in women: If you have female anatomy, Fournier’s gangrene most often happens due to an abscess near your anus or on your vulva. Other causes can include injuries from surgery or radiation treatments. You might get infected with several kinds of bacteria. The most common found in people with Fournier’s gangrene include: Group A streptococci Staphylococcus aureus E. coli Pseudomonas aeruginosa Fournier's Gangrene Risk Factors Fournier’s gangrene is most common in people who have a weak immune system or other health problems. You're more likely to get Fournier’s gangrene if you have: Diabetes. Between 20% and 70% of people who get Fournier’s gangrene have diabetes. But most people with diabetes won’t get Fournier’s gangrene. Alcohol misuse problems HIV infection Liver damage High blood pressure Kidney failure Obesity Heart disease Your risk also is higher if you're: Over 50 A smoker Getting chemotherapy Taking steroid drugs Fournier's gangrene can affect people of any age and gender. Some cases have been reported in infants. But the peak risk is in men ages 50-60. Because secretions can drain through your vagina, having female anatomy seems to lower risks. Can diabetes drugs cause Fournier’s gangrene? The FDA has reported cases in people with type 2 diabetes who were taking certain drugs to lower their blood sugar. These drugs are called SGLT2 inhibitors and include medications such as canagliflozin (Invokana), dapagliflozin (Farxiga), empagliflozin (Jardiance), and ertugliflozin (Steglatro). It’s not clear why people taking those drugs might have a higher risk. One possibility is that the drugs increase the risk of urinary tract infections. Fournier's Gangrene Diagnosis If your doctor thinks you may have Fournier's gangrene, they will ask about your symptoms and look at your skin. If you're in danger, you might start treatment without any other tests. If you do get tests, they could include: A computerized tomography (CT) scan that might help find where the infection is An ultrasound exam that can help rule out other problems that cause similar symptoms X-rays that look for gas in the damaged tissues. Gas is released from some of the bacteria that cause Fournier’s gangrene Blood tests to look for signs of infections and other clues Fournier's Gangrene Treatment The main treatments for Fournier’s gangrene are surgery and antibiotics. You may get surgery very quickly after diagnosis. The doctor will remove as much dead skin and tissue as possible to stop the damage from getting any worse. That kind of surgery is called debridement. You might need several of these surgeries to get rid of all the dead tissue. In rare cases, the entire penis and scrotum might be removed. You'll get antibiotics, drugs to kill the bacteria damaging your body. You may need several kinds of antibiotics. Instead of taking pills, you will get them through an IV, so that the medicine can get directly into your veins. That can kill the harmful bacteria more quickly. Once the infection is under control, you can get reconstructive surgery. The goal will be for your body to look the way it did before the gangrene, if possible. You might also get something called hyperbaric oxygen therapy. That’s when you sit in a special room or lie in a tube with high oxygen levels. The oxygen can help heal wounds and stop bacteria from growing. Recovery from Fournier’s gangrene can take a while. You might spend several weeks in the hospital. Complications of Fournier's Gangrene If Fournier’s gangrene isn't stopped in the earliest stages, you can get serious complications. These can include: Sepsis. When you have an extreme reaction to an infection, inflammation can spread through your body. This is a dangerous situation and can cause your blood pressure to plunge. The most extreme form of sepsis is called septic shock. Organ failure. Your major organs, like your kidneys, heart, and lungs, can stop working when you have sepsis. Blood clots. The inflammation can also make blood cells clump up in your arteries and veins. Blood clots can cause strokes and heart attacks. Complications for women: While women (and those identified as female at birth) are less likely to get Fournier’s gangrene, they often get sicker from it. For example, they spend more days in the hospital and are more likely to need help from breathing machines and other intensive care. Outlook for Fournier's Gangrene You're more likely to survive Fournier’s gangrene than to die from it.  But after the crisis, you might have some lingering problems. These can include: Sexual problems. You might, for example, lose feeling in your genitals and have problems with erections. Needing a colostomy bag. That’s a bag attached to your belly to collect poop when you can’t poop through your anus. Using the bag for a while may help you heal. Depression Digestive problems Urinary tract infections Ongoing pain You might need to see more than one medical specialist to deal with such issues and help improve your quality of life. Can You Prevent Fournier's Gangrene? There are some steps you can take to lower your chances of getting Fournier’s gangrene: If you have diabetes, regularly check your genitals and surrounding areas for wounds or signs of infection, like redness and swelling. Keep your blood sugar at a healthy level. For people with diabetes, that means keeping up with your medications. If you're obese or overweight, try to lose some weight. Ask your doctor about the best ways to do this. If you smoke or chew tobacco, stop. To lower your risk of infection, wash any open wounds in the area with soap and water and keep them dry and clean until they heal. Keep your genital and anal areas clean and dry. Takeaways Fournier’s gangrene is a life-threatening infection. It usually starts with redness, swelling, and pain around your genitals or anus. If you have possible signs, it’s very important to see a doctor right away. Early treatment can save your life. FAQs What is the most common cause of Fournier’s gangrene? The most common causes are infections in your urinary tract or the area near your anus that make their way into other tissues. Is Fournier’s gangrene an STD (a sexually transmitted disease, also known as an STI, or sexually transmitted infection)? No. You can’t get Fournier’s gangrene from another person or pass it to someone else. Sexual  activity can play a role if it causes cuts in your skin when you have already have an infection. Is Fournier’s gangrene caused by poor hygiene? Poor hygiene doesn't cause the disease. But keeping your genitals and perineum clean can help lower your risk. Can you survive Fournier’s gangrene? Most people survive. Some small, older studies found death rates higher than 50%. But larger, more recent studies mostly show death rates in the 20%-40% range. The largest studies find even lower death rates of 7.5% to 16%. Getting clear answers is hard because Fournier’s gangrene is so rare. One thing is clear: The more quickly you get treatment, the more likely you are to survive."
94,Syphilis,"What Is Syphilis? Syphilis is a highly contagious disease that’s mostly spread through sexual activity, including vaginal, oral, and anal sex . It can stay in your body for a long time before it causes symptoms. You might not know that you have it and then pass it on to your sexual partner. Early syphilis causes sores, rashes, and other symptoms. If left untreated, it can cause serious long-term problems that affect the brain, eyes, heart, and other organs. Early syphilis can be treated with the antibiotic penicillin. It's harder to treat as it gets worse. That's why it's important to see your doctor if you notice any symptoms or think you may have been exposed to the bacteria. Syphilis Causes Syphilis is caused by the bacteria Treponema pallidum . You get it through direct contact with a syphilis sore on someone else’s body. The bacteria can also get into your body through cuts on your skin or through your mucous membranes. This usually happens during sexual activity. You can also get it through other forms of direct contact, such as sharing needles with someone who is infected while taking intravenous (injected) drugs. Babies can have congenital (from birth) syphilis if their mother has it during pregnancy. It's also possible for babies to get it by breastfeeding. Syphilis can’t be spread by toilet seats, doorknobs, swimming pools, hot tubs, bathtubs, shared clothing, or eating utensils. Syphilis Risk Factors Any sexually active person can get syphilis. But you’re at higher risk of getting syphilis if you: Have unprotected sex Have more than one sex partner Have HIV , which is the virus that causes AIDS Are positive for another STD such as gonorrhea, chlamydia, or herpes People assigned male at birth are more likely to have syphilis than people assigned female at birth. People assigned male at birth are also at higher risk if they have sex with other people assigned male at birth. Syphilis Symptoms The first symptom of syphilis is a small sore called a chancre (SHANG-kur). The sore is usually firm, round, and painless. It is located where the syphilis bacteria enters your body, such as your penis, vagina, anus, rectum, lips, or mouth. Because it doesn’t hurt, some people never notice the chancre. It may be mistaken for a pimple or hidden from view inside the vagina or rectum. After a while, you may have these symptoms: Rash Sores Fever Swollen lymph nodes Sore throat Headaches Patchy hair loss Weight loss Muscle aches Fatigue (tiredness) Syphilis rash The rash can appear on one or more parts of your body, including the palms of your hands and soles (bottoms) of your feet. Usually, it shows up first on the trunk of your body (your chest, stomach, pelvis, or back). Your rash may show up while you still have a sore or weeks later. The rash usually doesn’t itch. It may be red or reddish-brown in color and feel rough to the touch. Sometimes it is so light you may not notice it. On darker skin, a syphilis rash may fade into your skin tone or be lighter in color. (Photo credit: Dr M.A. Ansary/Science Source) A syphilis rash on lighter skin will appear reddish. (Photo credit: Martin M. Rotker/Science Source) Syphilis sore After the early chancre, you might get some wart-like sores. These can appear in your mouth or near your genital area (penis, vagina, or anus). Stages of Syphilis There are four stages of syphilis: Early or primary syphilis This is when chancres show up. They heal without a scar within 3-6 weeks without medical treatment. But the disease is still there, so it's important to get treatment before you go into the second stage. Secondary syphilis This stage begins with a rash on your chest, stomach, pelvis, or back. Later, it might appear on your hands and feet. These may look like rashes caused by other diseases. Syphilis rash usually doesn't itch like other rashes. It can range in appearance from red to reddish-brown, or it may be so light that it's barely noticeable. As with primary syphilis, symptoms of secondary syphilis will get better without treatment. But the disease has not gone away. Latent syphilis If you don’t get treatment for syphilis, the disease will move from the secondary stage to the latent or “hidden” stage. During this stage, you will have no symptoms. The latent stage can last for years and fool you into believing you no longer have syphilis bacteria in your body. For some people, symptoms never return; but for others, if untreated, the disease will move to the final stage. The health risks at that stage are very serious, which is why it’s so important to treat syphilis, even if symptoms go away on their own. Tertiary or late syphilis In this advanced stage, syphilis can cause problems with your heart, brain, blood vessels, liver, bones, joints, and nerves. Up to 30%-40% of people who don’t get treatment for syphilis reach the tertiary stage. You could become paralyzed (unable to move), blind, or deaf, or get dementia or impotence. It can even be deadly. Without treatment, syphilis can spread to your brain and nervous system during any of the four stages. This condition is called neurosyphilis. Neurosyphilis can cause severe headaches, muscle weakness or paralysis, confusion or trouble focusing, or dementia. Syphilis can also spread to the eye (ocular syphilis) and cause eye pain, redness, vision problems, or blindness. When syphilis spreads to your ear (otosyphilis), it can cause hearing loss, tinnitus (ringing or buzzing in your ear), dizziness, or vertigo (feeling like the room is spinning). Syphilis Complications If you don’t get treatment, syphilis can cause complications all over your body: Small bumps . Bumps called gummas can grow on your skin, bones, or organs. They can destroy the tissue around them. Nervous system problems. Syphilis can cause problems such as headaches, stroke, brain damage, paralysis, bladder issues, or difficulty getting an erection. Cardiovascular problems. The disease can damage your heart valves or cause bulging blood vessels (aneurysms) or an inflamed aorta, which is the blood vessel that carries oxygen and nutrients throughout your body. HIV. Syphilis can increase your chance of getting HIV. Pregnancy and childbirth problems. If you’re pregnant, you could pass syphilis to your unborn baby. This condition, congenital syphilis, can lead to miscarriage, stillbirth (birth of an infant who has died before delivery), or death of your newborn. Syphilis in Pregnancy Your unborn baby can become infected with syphilis through the placenta, the organ that provides nutrients and oxygen in the womb. Infants can also become infected during birth. The CDC says pregnant people should be tested for syphilis at least once during pregnancy. It’s best if you're tested at your first prenatal visit. Depending on how long you've had syphilis, you have a high chance of stillbirth, or giving birth to an infant who has died before delivery. There's also a high chance your newborn could die shortly after birth. If you pass it to your baby, it may be born without symptoms but could have them within a few weeks if the disease isn’t treated right away. These signs and symptoms can be very serious. Untreated babies may experience delayed development, seizures, or even death. Babies born with syphilis may have: Sores and rashes Fever Jaundice (yellowing of skin and eyes) Anemia (not enough red blood cells) Swollen spleen and liver Sneezing or stuffed, drippy nose Bone changes Later signs may include: Deafness Teeth problems Collapse of the bridge of the nose (saddle nose) Syphilis Diagnosis Your doctor will need to do a physical exam. They might give you tests including: Blood tests. A quick test at your doctor’s office or a public health clinic can diagnose syphilis. This is the main way syphilis is diagnosed. Cerebrospinal fluid tests. If your doctor thinks you might have neurosyphilis, they’ll test fluid taken from around your spinal cord. Darkfield microscopy. Syphilis bacteria are visible through a microscope in fluid taken from a skin sore or lymph node. Syphilis Treatment Syphilis is curable with quick diagnosis and treatment. But if it’s treated too late, it can permanently damage your heart and brain even after the infection is gone. Because syphilis is caused by a bacterial infection, it is treated with an antibiotic. Penicillin is the most commonly used antibiotic (medication) for syphilis. It’s important to finish taking all of the medication your doctor prescribes, even if your symptoms go away. Don’t have sexual contact until the infection is completely gone. Let your current sexual partners (as well as any from the last 2 years) know they should also be tested and, if necessary, treated. If your partner is infected and not treated, they could reinfect you. Some people with syphilis have an immune system reaction called a Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction several hours after their first treatment. This might include fever, chills, headache, upset stomach, rash, or joint and muscle pain. These problems usually go away within 24 hours. After you have finished your treatment, your doctor may want to do additional tests, such as blood work, to make sure the infection is gone. Syphilis medication If you've had syphilis for less than a year, one dose of penicillin is usually enough to kill the infection. This is given by injection into your muscle. If you’re allergic to penicillin, you might get another antibiotic instead, such as doxycycline or ceftriaxone. If you’re in a later stage of the disease, you’ll need more doses. You should not take doxycycline if you’re pregnant. Your doctor will decide what medication is best for you based on your case. Is syphilis curable? Syphilis is 100% curable if treated with the correct antibiotics. However, antibiotics cannot repair long-term damage to your organs caused by the infection. This is why it’s important to seek treatment before syphilis reaches the latent or tertiary stage. Can I live a normal life after syphilis? If you receive treatment with antibiotics during the primary or secondary stage of syphilis, you can recover from the infection and avoid long-term health problems. Without treatment, syphilis can cause serious health problems and death. If you’ve had syphilis, you can get it again. Be sure to practice safe sex and get tested often if you are at high risk for sexually transmitted infections. Syphilis Prevention You can get syphilis again after treatment kills the infection. The only way to avoid syphilis altogether is to not have anal, oral, or vaginal sex. But you can reduce your risk of syphilis infection: Don’t have intimate contact with someone if you know they’re infected. If you don’t know whether a sexual partner is infected, use a condom every time you have sex. Make sure you use the condom correctly. Syphilis can still spread if lesions aren't properly covered by a condom. Use a dental dam when you have oral sex. These are thin sheets of polyurethane used to provide a barrier between the mouth and vagina or anus. Don't share sex toys. Be in a long-term, mutually monogamous relationship with someone who doesn't have syphilis. If you are in a relationship with someone who has syphilis, you're at risk as well. You may need to get treatment based on your specific case. Talk to your doctor to figure out the best way to treat or prevent a syphilis infection. Telling Your Partner You Have Syphilis If you are diagnosed with syphilis, you need to let your sex partner(s) know so that they can be tested and treated. This includes your current partners and any you have had over the last 2 years. If your current partner has syphilis, they can reinfect you after you’ve been treated. It’s important that you both get treated so you don’t keep passing syphilis to each other. After you find out you have syphilis, you may be contacted by your local health department. An employee from the department will talk to you about private ways to let your partners know they have been exposed to syphilis. You can ask the health department to do this for you without sharing your identity with your partners. They can also help you tell your partners through a free service called “partner notification.” Your health department can also assist you in finding treatment and counseling services. Don’t engage in any sexual activity until you’ve completed treatment with antibiotics and tests show that you are no longer infected. Wait until your partner has finished treatment to prevent reinfection. Takeaways Syphilis is a highly contagious disease that is caused most often through sexual contact. It is 100% curable if treated correctly with antibiotics. If your infection is left untreated, even if your symptoms go away, it can cause very serious, long-term health problems and even death. Talk to your doctor right away if you think you have or have been exposed to syphilis."
95,What Are the Types and Stages of Syphilis?,"Syphilis is a common sexually transmitted disease ( STD ). It’s easily cured but can be serious if it’s not treated. This STD develops in four stages. Symptoms in the first two can be so mild that you might not notice them. One stage -- latent syphilis -- doesn’t have symptoms. The other three phases have distinct symptoms. They develop as follows: Primary Painless sores appear at the site of infection ( mouth , anus , rectum, vagina , or penis ). These are called chancres. The sores heal on their own after 3 to 6 weeks, but you can still spread syphilis. It’s easily treated and cured with medicine. Secondary Rough red or reddish brown rash on palms of hands and soles of feet Swollen lymph nodes Fever Sore throat Patchy hair loss Headaches and body aches Extreme tiredness ( fatigue ) These symptoms will go away, even if you don’t get treated. But if you’re not treated, your infection will get worse. Latent During this phase, the syphilis bacteria are still alive in your body, but you have no signs or symptoms of the infection. You’re not contagious during this stage, but syphilis may still affect your heart , brain , nerves, bones, and other parts of your body. This phase can last for years. Not everyone who has syphilis will enter this phase of the infection. Some people will go into the tertiary stage. Tertiary (Late) This stage begins when symptoms from the secondary stage disappear. Syphilis isn’t contagious at this point, but the infection has started to affect your organs. This can lead to death. Symptoms of tertiary syphilis may include: Problems controlling muscle movements Numbness Vision problems (you may start going blind) Dementia When Is It Contagious? If you have syphilis, you can spread it during the first two stages and the early latent stage to someone you have sex with. If your partner touches a chancre or your rash, they can get the infection. It can enter the body through the genitals, mouth or broken skin. Pregnant women infected with syphilis can pass it on to their baby. Even if the chancre is hidden inside your vagina or rectum, you can still spread syphilis. To lower your risk of catching this STD , always use condoms during sex . If you think there’s a chance you or your partner has it, get tested and treated."
96,Syringomyelia,"What Is Syringomyelia? Syringomyelia is a long-term condition that causes fluid-filled cysts , which doctors call “syrinx,” to form inside your spinal cord. You may also hear it called hydromyelia, syringohydromyelia, or Morvan disease. You may not have symptoms, or even be aware that you have it. But a severe case can cause problems that need to be treated. Syringomyelia is most common in adults ages 20 to 40, but it can happen to people of all ages. Men are more likely to get it than women. Syringomyelia Symptoms Symptoms depend on the location and size of the cyst . Over time, if it grows wider and longer, it can damage the nerves in the center of your spinal cord. This can lead to chronic pain that’s hard to treat. Symptoms usually happen slowly over many years. But they can appear suddenly after an accident, like a fall. Other symptoms you may have include: Curving of the spine , called scoliosis Changes in or loss of bowel and bladder function Heavy sweating Not being able to feel hot and cold in the fingers, hands, arms, and upper chest Loss of reflexes Muscle stiffness that may make it hard to walk Muscle weakness, especially in the arms, hands, and shoulders Feeling numbness, tingling, burning, or piercing Pain in the neck, shoulders, and sometimes arms and hands Paralysis (in severe cases) Headaches Sexual problems Swings in blood pressure levels Twitches , or involuntary muscle contractions Uncoordinated movements If the cyst damages a nerve that controls the muscles in your eyes and face, you may get what doctors call Horner syndrome . It causes droopy eyelids, narrowing of the opening between the eyelids, reduced pupil size, and decreased sweating on the affected side of the face. Syringomyelia Causes You get this condition when something blocks the normal flow of cerebrospinal fluid, which protects your spinal cord and brain . It enters the central canal of the spinal cord and can cause a cyst to form. With syringomyelia, there are two main reasons this fluid can get blocked or rerouted: a birth defect or trauma. Congenital syringomyelia, also called communicating syringomyelia, usually happens when there’s a problem with the baby ’s brain development during pregnancy . A defect that doctors call a “Chiari I malformation” causes the lower part of the baby ’s brain to push downward into their spinal canal. This blocks the normal flow of fluid between the spine and the brain, and a cyst forms. But not everyone with a Chiari I malformation gets this disorder. Symptoms usually show up between ages 25 and 40. Acquired syringomyelia, also called primary spinal or noncommunicating syringomyelia, is when a cyst forms in a damaged part of the spinal cord. It may happen when there is: Swelling of the covering of the spinal cord Meningitis Spinal cord injury Spinal tumor Tethered spinal cord Sometimes, it happens for reasons doctors don’t understand. They call this “idiopathic syringomyelia.” Syringomyelia Diagnosis Doctors use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the brain and spine to see if you have syringomyelia. The MRI can show a cyst or other condition. Sometimes, doctors discover you have this condition when doing an MRI for another health reason. You might also have a kind of X-ray procedure called a CT scan of your spine. Syringomyelia Treatment What kind of treatment you get for syringomyelia depends on whether you have symptoms, and how serious they are. Monitoring : You probably won’t need treatment if you don’t have symptoms or if they’ve mild. But you should have regular checkups to watch for cyst growth and changes in signs and symptoms. The doctor may tell you to avoid activities like heavy lifting that involve straining. They might also prescribe medicine for pain or refer you to physical therapy . Surgery: If your symptoms cause problems, you may need surgery to restore the normal flow of the cerebrospinal fluid. The type of surgery you’ll have depends on what caused your syringomyelia. For example, if the problem is due to a Chiari I malformation, your doctor might do a procedure called posterior fossa decompression. They’ll remove the bone at the back of your skull and spine. It creates more space for your brainstem and cerebellum, the part of the brain that controls your movements and balance. Talk to the doctor about the risks and benefits of surgery. Syringomyelia Outlook Surgery for syringomyelia doesn’t always fix the problem. Fluid can build up again. And sometimes, the damage to your nerves and spinal cord is permanent. You’ll need regular follow-ups with your doctor, including MRIs, to check whether the cyst has come back."
97,What Is Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis?,"You may know that white blood cells are your body’s infection fighters. But if your body makes too much of a type of immune cell called histiocytes, they can cause tumors, lesions, and other tissue damage. One of these rare disorders -- which resembles some types of cancer -- is called Langerhans cell histiocytosis, or LCH. It most commonly appears in toddlers and very young children, but you can have it as an adult, too. Symptoms LCH can show up on many places on your body, but most often on your skin and bones. It can affect any organ, including your lungs , liver , brain , spleen , or lymph nodes . In about 8 out of 10 people, LCH leads to tumors called granulomas in the skull and in other bones. That can cause pain and swelling, and sometimes it can fracture your arms or legs. LCH symptoms can range from mild to more serious. Some people are born with it, and the disease eventually goes away on its own. But others have a severe and long-lasting type that affects multiple parts of the body. Along with your bones, it can affect your: Skin. Red, scaly bumps in skin folds are common. Infants with LCH can get red, scaly scalps, which is often mistaken for cradle cap , a common skin condition. Liver . Usually, only severe cases of LCH affect the liver. Your skin might appear jaundiced, or yellow, and your blood can take longer to clot. Lymph nodes. These glands, which are behind the ears , in the neck, and in other places, can swell up. You also might have trouble breathing or have coughs . Diagnosis Your doctor will know if you have LCH after a tissue biopsy . That’s when a specialist called a pathologist views the sample under a microscope for specific proteins and other markers of the disease. In addition to the physical exam , your doctors may order other tests based on your symptoms: X-rays of your lungs and bones Bone marrow biopsy to look for signs of LCH Blood chemistry test to check your kidneys , liver , thyroid , and immune system MRIs and PET and CT scans to get detailed images of your body Urinalysis to check levels of red and white cells, protein, and sugar in your pee Causes We don’t know all the reasons why some people get LCH. About half of the people with the disorder have a faulty gene that makes the Langerhans immune cells grow out of control. That genetic mutation happens after birth, which means you usually won’t get LCH from your parents. Researchers suspect that other things may also play a role: Smoking Parents who were exposed to environmental toxins, like benzene or wood dust Infections as a newborn Family history of thyroid disease Treatments As with some types of cancer , doctors sometimes treat LCH with chemotherapy . Many people with the disorder get care from cancer specialists like oncologists and hematologists. But unlike most cancers, limited forms of LCH sometimes spontaneously go away on their own. Beside chemotherapy, options for treatment include: Low-dose radiation to targeted part of the body Surgery to remove LCH lesions Steroids like prednisone or anti-inflammatory drugs Ultraviolet light therapy for skin conditions Stem cell transplant Bone marrow, liver, or lung transplants in very serious cases A great majority of people with LCH recover with treatment. If the disease is in your spleen, liver, or bone marrow, it’s called a high-risk LCH. About 80% of people with that type survive."
98,What Are Chronic Myeloproliferative Disorders?,"Chronic myeloproliferative disorders (MPD) are rare blood cancers that have many different symptoms, yet no clear cause. Because of that, they can be tricky to diagnose. Years of care and treatment are common. What Are They? Your blood contains red blood cells , white blood cells , and platelets. Each of these has a crucial job to do. Your red blood cells carry oxygen throughout your body. White blood cells protect your body from germs. Platelets control your bleeding. All of these parts of blood are made in your bone marrow, the soft tissue inside your bones. If you have MPD, your bone marrow makes too many deformed red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets. These pile up in your blood. There are six different types of MPD. The kind you have depends on which blood cells your body is making in excess. The six types are: Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML): Too many immature white blood cells are being made in your bone marrow. Polycythemia vera : You have an increased number of red blood cells. Often, there’s an excess of platelets and white blood cells, too. People with this have too many immature white and red blood cells. The web of fibers inside the bone marrow becomes thick, like scar tissue. This causes fewer and fewer red blood cells to be made. Primary myelofibrosis (chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis): People with this have too many immature white and red blood cells. The web of fibers inside the bone marrow becomes thick, like scar tissue. This causes fewer and fewer red blood cells to be made. Essential thrombocythemia: If you have this kind of MPD, you have too many platelets. Chronic neutrophilic leukemia: This disorder causes you to have a surplus of neutrophils -- a certain type of white blood cell -- in your bloodstream. Chronic eosinophilia leukemia: Eosinophils are another type of white blood cell. Your body produces them when you’ve been exposed to an allergen or parasite . People with this type of MPD have a high number of them in their blood. Any of these disorders can also lead to acute leukemia. This means that your bone marrow is making deformed white blood cells. What Are the Causes? Doctors are still trying to answer this question. So far, what’s known is that if you have MPD, you have a gene mutation (change) on your bone marrow cells. This keeps your body from being able to make the right amount and kind of blood cells. You aren’t born with this mutation. It happens when you’re an adult. Some theories are that having a virus or being around toxic chemicals or radiation can cause this to happen. Only in very rare cases do MPDs run in families. What Are the Symptoms? Signs that you have one of these disorders include: Fatigue Itchy skin Night sweats Bone pain Fever Weight loss Major complications of these disorders include: Excessive bleeding, which can happen with a minor cut, bruising or when capillaries break under the skin Blood clots (thrombosis) The disease changing into leukemia How Are You Diagnosed? In the early stages of MPD, many people don’t have any symptoms. This makes it a challenge to diagnose. Any signs that do show up are often thought to be other, more common health problems. It is often found by chance when you have routine blood work. You may need to see a doctor who specializes in MPD to be diagnosed. Blood tests will be ordered to get more details about your health. To confirm the diagnosis, a bone marrow biopsy is often done. To do this, a hollow needle will be put into your hip bone or breastbone. Then a sample of blood, bone marrow, or bone will be removed and sent to a lab. There, it can be checked under a microscope to look for cancer cells. What’s the Treatment? These disorders are difficult to cure. Your doctor will typically focus on trying to get your blood cells back to normal levels and reducing the risk for major complications. The treatment depends on which myeloproliferative disorder you have. Some of the most common treatments are: Chemotherapy : Powerful medications are used to kill extra blood cells in your body. You may get this through an IV, or you could be given a pill that you take by mouth . Radiation therapy: High-powered X-rays or other types of radiation can lower the number of blood cells you have and may relieve your symptoms. Phlebotomy : A unit of blood can be removed from you in order to decrease red blood cell counts. Gene therapy: New medications may be able to block or repair the mutated gene that causes MPD. Hormone therapy : Certain hormones can extend the life of your normal blood cells or push your bone marrow to make more. Hormone therapy may also lessen some side effects of MPD. Stem cell transplant: If you have a severe case of MPD, you might be able to have a stem cell transplant. During this procedure, healthy bone marrow, often from a bone marrow donor, is transferred to you. This is the only treatment that has the potential to cure MPD, but it’s not for everyone. Surgery: If your spleen is swollen, it may be removed during a surgery called a splenectomy . Clinical trials : These studies test new cancer treatments to see if they work as well or better than what’s already being used. In some cases, they may be your best choice. You may be among the first to try a new cancer medication or treatment, while helping with a crucial part of cancer research. Watchful waiting: If your MPD is very mild and you have no symptoms, your doctor may also suggest you wait to start any treatment. Some people are fine for several years with only a daily aspirin to prevent blood clots and regular doctor visits."
