0,Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS),"[""What Is Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)? IBS is a mix of belly discomfort or pain and trouble with bowel habits: either going more or less often than normal ( diarrhea or constipation ) or having a different kind of stool (thin, hard, or soft and liquid). Doctors used to call IBS other names, including: IBS colitis Mucous colitis Spastic colon Nervous colon Spastic bowel IBS isn’t life-threatening, and it doesn't make you more likely to get other colon conditions, such as ulcerative colitis , Crohn's disease , or colon cancer . But it can be a long-lasting problem that changes how you live your life. People with IBS may miss work or school more often, and they may feel less able to take part in daily activities. Some people may need to change their work setting: shifting to working at home, changing hours, or even not working at all. Constipation and diarrhea can be symptoms of IBS.

If it’s IBS, you’ll likely have these symptoms weekly for 3 months, or less often for at least 6 months. People assigned female at birth (AFAB) who have IBS may have more symptoms during their period. Some people also have urinary symptoms or sexual problems. Stress can make symptoms worse. When to call your doctor', 'If you have an IBS symptom that lasts a long time, you get a new symptom, your pain is worse than usual, or you have new pain, see your doctor. If you usually take over-the-counter medications but now they don’t ease problems like diarrhea, gas, or cramping, you also need to see a doctor.', 'Even if you don’t think a problem is physically part of IBS, but it bothers you, tell your doctor. For example, if you’re stressed out or anxious about it, or if you’re losing sleep over the problem, let your doctor know. IBS usually doesn’t lead to more serious diseases, but there are “red flags” to look for that could mean something more serious is going on. A red-flag symptom is one that isn’t usually seen with IBS. If you have one or more, see your doctor. You’ll need tests to find out what’s going on. Red-flag symptoms include: Rectal bleeding: It could just be a side effect from your irritable bowel syndrome constipation, caused by a tear in your anus. The bleeding also might be caused by a hemorrhoid. But if you have a large amount of blood in your stool, or if the bleeding just won’t go away, you should get medical attention as soon as possible. Weight loss: If you find you’re losing weight for no reason, it’s time to get it checked out. Fever, vomiting, and anemia: If you have one or more, or think you do, you should call your doctor.', 'Irritable bowel syndrome symptoms in children IBS affects as many as 1 in 6 children, and they share many of the same symptoms of IBS that adults have. Irritable bowel syndrome symptoms in children may include: Belly pain or\xa0discomfort that may improve after pooping Diarrhea, constipation, or both Mucus in your poop Urgent need to poop Bloating Cramping Flatulence (farting) Weight loss Nausea and vomiting Feeling like you haven’t finished pooping Children also can have red-flag symptoms that could mean something more concerning than IBS. These symptoms include: Ongoing pain in the upper or lower right side of their belly (abdomen) A hard time swallowing or pain when swallowing Ongoing vomiting Diarrhea at night Bleeding from their rectum, blood in their vomit, or other signs of gastrointestinal bleeding Arthritis Unexplained weight loss Slowed growth Delayed puberty', 'IBS vs. IBD Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are very different conditions that share a few symptoms in common, such as belly discomfort and diarrhea. Both are chronic and have no known cure. But IBD is much more serious. The inflammation that it causes can damage your intestines, and the disease raises your risk of colorectal cancer. IBS, on the other hand, does not harm your gut or increase your chances of cancer or other serious health concerns.', ""What Causes IBS? While several things are known to trigger IBS symptoms , experts don't know what causes the condition. Studies suggest that the colon gets hypersensitive, overreacting to mild stimulation. Instead of slow, rhythmic muscle movements, the bowel muscles spasm. That can cause diarrhea or constipation. Another theory suggests it may involve chemicals made by the body, such as serotonin and gastrin, that control nerve signals between the brain and digestive tract. Other researchers are studying to see if certain bacteria in the bowels can lead to the condition."", ""Risk Factors for Irritable Bowel Syndrome IBS affects between 25 million and 45 million Americans. Some things seem to make people more likely to have it than others: Being assigned female at birth. About twice as many people AFAB as those assigned male at birth (AMAB) have the condition. It’s not clear why, but some researchers think the changing hormones in the menstrual cycle may have something to do with it. So far, studies haven’t borne this out. Age. IBS can affect people of all ages, but it's more likely to happen in people in their teens through their 40s. Family history. The condition seems to run in families. Some studies have shown that your genes may play a role. Emotional trouble. Some people with IBS seem to have trouble with stress , have a mental disorder, or have been through a traumatic event in their lives, such as sexual abuse or domestic violence. It's not clear what comes first – the stress or the IBS. But there's evidence that stress management and behavioral therapy can help relieve symptoms in some people with the condition. Food sensitivities. Some people may have digestive systems that rumble angrily when they eat dairy, wheat, a sugar in fruits called fructose, or the sugar substitute sorbitol. Fatty foods, carbonated drinks, and alcohol can also upset digestion. There's no proof any of these foods cause IBS, but they may trigger symptoms. Medications. Studies have shown a link between IBS symptoms and antibiotics, antidepressants, and drugs made with sorbitol . Other digestive problems, like stomach flu, traveler's diarrhea, or food poisoning . A small study published in January 2021 suggests that a GI tract infection can change the immune system so that it responds to certain foods as if they're a threat, like germs or viruses. Researchers are looking into these early findings. Chronic pain conditions. Several disorders that cause pain have been linked to irritable bowel syndrome, including: Fibromyalgia Chronic pelvic pain Interstitial cystitis, which causes bladder pain Migraine Temporomandibular syndrome, which causes pain when chewing Chronic fatigue syndrome"", ""IBS Diagnosis There are no specific lab tests that can diagnose IBS. Your doctor will see if your symptoms match with the definition of IBS, and they may run tests to rule out conditions such as: Food allergies or intolerances, such as lactose intolerance and poor dietary habits Medications such as high blood pressure drugs , iron, and certain antacids Infection Enzyme deficiencies where the pancreas isn't releasing enough enzymes to properly digest or break down food Inflammatory bowel diseases like ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease"", ""Your doctor may do some of the following tests to decide if you have IBS: Flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy to look for signs of blockage or inflammation in your intestines Upper endoscopy if you have heartburn or indigestion X-rays Blood tests to look for anemia (too few red blood cells ), thyroid problems , and signs of infection Stool tests for blood or infections Tests for lactose intolerance, gluten allergy , or celiac disease Tests to look for problems with your bowel muscles 10 questions to ask your doctor Going to the doctor can be intimidating. You might feel rushed and forget to ask questions that are important. It's always a good idea to know what to ask beforehand and to take notes during your appointment. Some of the questions below may be worth asking. Print them out to take with you to your next appointment: Could some other condition be causing my IBS symptoms ? Could I have inflammatory bowel disease or colon cancer? Should I keep a diary of my IBS symptoms , and, if so, what should I write down? Should I take laxatives or other over-the-counter medications ? If so, what type, and how often is it safe to take them? Would adding more fiber to my diet help with my IBS symptoms? If so, how much and what kind? Are there other dietary changes you would recommend for IBS, a nd should I consult a dietitian? Could relaxation therapy, counseling, or exercise ease my IBS ? Should I take prescription medications for my IBS symptoms? If so, what side effects should I expect? Are there any tests you would recommend now or in the future? Are there any other approaches or treatments I should know about? How soon should I have a follow-up appointment?"", ""IBS Treatment Nearly all people with IBS can get help, but no single treatment works for everyone. You and your doctor will need to work together to find the right treatment plan to manage your symptoms. Many things can trigger IBS symptoms , including certain foods, medicines, the presence of gas or stool, and emotional stress . You’ll need to learn what your triggers are. You may need to make some lifestyle changes and take medication. Lifestyle changes Usually, with a few basic changes in activities, IBS will improve over time. Here are some tips to help ease symptoms: Avoid caffeine (in coffee , tea , and soda). Add fiber to your diet with foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains , and nuts. Go slowly, though. Adding too much fiber at once can lead to gas and bloating. A fiber supplement may be easier on your gut than foods loaded with fiber. Drink at least eight glasses of water per day. Don't smoke. Learn to relax, either by getting more exercise or by reducing stress in your life. Find a relaxation technique that works for you. There are lots to choose from, including: Diaphragmatic/belly breathing Progressive muscle relaxation Visualization/positive imagery Meditation Eat slowly and chew your food thoroughly to ease digestion. Don’t skip meals. Instead, stick to a regular meal schedule to help keep your bowels moving regularly. Eat smaller meals more often instead of big meals. Keep a record of the foods you eat so you can figure out which foods bring on bouts of IBS. Sleep 7 to 9 hours every night, which can help relieve IBS-triggering stress Exercise regularly – think walking, biking, swimming, or other workouts that raise your heart rate – with a goal of at least 30 minutes a day, 5 days per week. Skip carbonated beverages. Those bubbles can irritate your gut."", ""Therapy Anxiety and depression often travel with IBS, and managing those conditions may ease your IBS symptoms. Talk to you doctor about the following therapies. One of them may be right for you. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) Biofeedback Hypnotherapy Medications The following types of drugs and supplements are used to treat IBS: Bulking agents, such as psyllium , wheat bran, and corn fiber, help slow the movement of food through the digestive system and may also help relieve symptoms. Antibiotics , such as rifaximin ( Xifaxan ), can change the amount of bacteria in your intestines . You take pills for 2 weeks. It can control symptoms for as long as 6 months. If they come back, you can be treated again. Other treatments can help with symptoms of IBS: Belly pain and bloating Antispasmodics can control colon muscle spasms, but experts are unsure that these drugs help. They also have side effects, such as making you drowsy and constipated, that make them a bad choice for some people. Antidepressants may also help relieve symptoms in some people. Probiotics are live bacteria and yeasts that are good for your health, especially your digestive system . Doctors often suggest them to help with digestive problems. These are available as supplements but also can be found in a variety of foods, such as yogurt, kombucha, and cottage cheese. Check the food label for “live active cultures.” Constipation Linaclotide (Linzess) is a capsule you take once daily on an empty stomach , at least 30 minutes before your first meal of the day. It helps to relieve constipation by helping bowel movements happen more often. It’s not for anyone 17 years old or younger. The drug's most common side effect is diarrhea. Lubiprostone ( Amitiza ) can treat IBS with constipation in people AFAB when other treatments have not helped. Studies haven’t fully shown that it works well in men. Common side effects include nausea , diarrhea, and belly pain. More serious side effects may include fainting , swelling of the arms and legs, breathing problems , and heart palpitations . Plecanatide (Trulance) has been shown to treat constipation without the usual side effects of cramping and belly pain. The once-a-day pill can be taken with or without food. It works to increase gastrointestinal fluid in your gut and encourage regular bowel movements. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is an osmotic laxative and causes water to remain in the stool, which results in softer stools. This medication may work best for those who can't tolerate dietary fiber supplements. Tegaserod is a drug for people AFAB . It works by speeding up the motion in your gut. This effect shortens the time stool remains in the bowel, and helps lessen symptoms such as belly pain and constipation. Tenapanor (IBSRELA) increases bowel movements and decreases belly pain. Diarrhea Alosetron ( Lotronex ) can help relieve stomach pain and slow your bowels to relieve diarrhea, but there can be serious side effects, so it’s only to be used by people AFAB with severe IBS-D whose symptoms aren’t helped by other treatments. Bile acid sequestrants are cholesterol -lowering medications. Taken orally, they work in the intestines by binding bile acids and reducing stool production. Eluxadoline (Viberzi) is prescribed to help reduce bowel contractions, belly cramps, and diarrhea. Loperamide ( Imodium ) works by slowing down the movement of the gut. This decreases the number of bowel movements and makes the stool less watery. Make sure to follow your doctor's instructions when taking IBS medications, including laxatives , which can be habit-forming if you don’t use them carefully."", ""IBS Triggers While the cause of IBS remains unknown, it’s clear that certain things can trigger your symptoms. Avoiding those triggers can bring relief. But IBS triggers vary from person to person, so it’s important to identify those that affect you. Here are some common triggers that could be contributing to your IBS discomfort. Stress may cause spasms in your colon that make your symptoms worse. Periods. If you were assigned female at birth, you may notice that your IBS symptoms get worse during your menstrual cycle. Poor sleep has been linked to IBS symptoms, possibly because it contributes to stress. Caffeine. It's found in coffee, tea, and soda, as well as chocolate and some over-the-counter pain medications. Milk and milk-based foods like cheese and ice cream, which contain lactose. Yogurt’s an exception because it contains live cultures that break down lactose. Carbonated drinks. The bubbles may not be easy on your stomach. Foods and drinks that are high in fructose. These include many processed foods as well as some fruits, like apples, pears, and dried fruit, as well as fruit juices. Wheat. This may be due to carbs in foods like wheat bread rather than gluten. Artificial sweeteners. Check food labels for sorbitol, mannitol, isomalt, maltitol, and xylitol, sugar substitutes that can cause diarrhea. Alcohol. Drinking may worsen your symptoms. Cruciferous vegetables. Broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, and Brussels sprouts, as well as leafy greens like kale and mustard greens, can cause gas and mess with your bowel movements. Onions, leeks, and shallots. These can make you gassy and upset your stomach. Beans or legumes. These contain indigestible chemicals called saccharides that can make you gassy. Baked beans, chickpeas, lentils, and soybeans are particular culprits. Because there are so many possible triggers, you may find it helpful to keep a journal or diary to track how you react to certain foods or conditions. This can help you identify triggers and rule out suspects. Share your journal with your nutritionist or health care provider to help guide your care plan."", ""IBS Diet If you have IBS, you may need to change your diet to better control your symptoms. Your doctor may suggest you try something called a low FODMAP diet that cuts down on different hard-to-digest carbs found in wheat, beans, and certain fruits and vegetables. FODMAP stands for fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols. Not all of these kinds of carbs may cause IBS symptoms for you, so your health care provider may suggest you start an elimination diet where you avoid eating all high FODMAP foods, then slowly reintroduce them to see which you react to. Once you know which ones trigger IBS symptoms, you can better avoid them. Common high FODMAP foods include beans and lentils; dairy products; fruits like apples, cherries, pears, and peaches; and wheat products. If you're concerned about getting enough calcium, you can try to get it from other foods, like spinach, turnip greens, tofu, yogurt, sardines, salmon with bones, calcium-fortified orange juice and breads, or calcium supplements."", ""Irritable Bowel Syndrome Complications Because finding an IBS treatment that works can take time, other health problems can crop up in the meantime. None of the complications are life-threatening, though. IBS doesn't lead to cancer or other more serious bowel-related conditions. Here are some of the health issues it can cause: Impacted bowel: If you're constipated for a long time, stool can get blocked in your colon . Sometimes it can get so hard that you can't push it out. This is known as a fecal impaction. It can hurt and cause things like a headache , nausea , and vomiting. It happens most often with older adults. See your doctor right away if you have signs this may be happening. Food intolerance : Certain foods can make your IBS symptoms worse. What they are can be different for everyone. But some people feel better when they cut out wheat, dairy, coffee , eggs , yeast, potatoes, and citrus fruits. And fats and sugars can make diarrhea worse. Your doctor may suggest you try a FODMAP diet to cut out some carbohydrates that are hard to digest. Malnourishment: Cutting back on some types of foods can ease your IBS symptoms. But your body may not get all the nutrients it needs. A dietitian can help you find a diet that works for you. Hemorrhoids : Swollen blood vessels around your anus , the opening where stool comes out, can hurt and bleed. Very hard or very loose stools can make the situation worse. If the swollen vessels are inside your anus, they may fall far enough to stick out. You can often treat hemorrhoids at home with an over-the-counter cream. You also might try sitting on a cold ice pack. And be sure to keep the area clean. Pregnancy complications : Hormone changes and the physical pressure a baby puts on the bowel wall can cause digestive issues. Many people AFAB also choose to stop any IBS drugs they're taking. This can be better for the baby. But it can make parents-to-be more likely to have things like heartburn and indigestion . Quality of life: Flare-ups can happen without warning. Also, you may have diarrhea for a time and then be constipated. Not being able to predict how you'll feel can make it hard to go about your daily life. You also probably need to see your doctor often and are likely to miss more work than other people. It may be harder to focus when you're at your job. Managing stress , for example through exercise or meditation , can help. Depression and anxiety : It's common for people who have IBS to feel like they're losing control over their lives. If your symptoms are bad, you may find yourself always trying to map out the nearest bathroom. Because there's a link between your brain and gut, this kind of stress can make your IBS worse. The pain and the awkward symptoms you're dealing with can affect your mood. It may help to talk to a counselor about what's going on with you."", 'Takeaways Doctors don’t know what causes IBS, but they do know that it does not raise your risk of more serious health conditions, like colorectal cancer. Still, its symptoms are unpleasant and can be painful. While no cure exists yet, treatment, including lifestyle changes, can ease your discomfort.', 'Irritable Bowel Syndrome FAQs What really causes IBS? Experts don’t know, but it may be due to problems with the way your brain and your digestive system communicate with each other. Imbalances in your gut bacteria, serious infections, food intolerances, and stress in childhood all may contribute to IBS. How do you treat an IBS flare-up? Avoid your food triggers, drink plenty of water (not carbonated!), exercise, and get good sleep. Medications and fiber supplements can help control symptoms like diarrhea and constipation. How long do IBS attacks last? Everyone with IBS experiences it differently. For some people, symptoms occur everyday. Other people may go for long periods without symptoms. In general, episodes of IBS are frequent but unpredictable.', 'What should I eat during an IBS flare-up? Choose foods that are easier on your stomach, like cooked vegetables instead of raw ones. You may find it easier to digest proteins like eggs, chicken, turkey, fish, and tofu. Cook with a minimal amount of fat, opting to roast, bake, steam, or boil foods. If you’re constipated, foods like oats and flax seeds can help.']"
1,What Is IBS-D?,"['IBS that causes increased diarrhea is often called IBS-D. If you have IBS-D, you have belly pain and other IBS symptoms plus frequent bowel movements. Your stool might be loose, though not always. You also might have sudden urges to use the bathroom. While there isn’t a cure for IBS-D, there are treatments that can improve the quality of your life and help you feel better.', 'What Causes IBS-D? Researchers don’t know what causes IBS or IBS-D. We do know that women are more likely to have it than men, and it’s more common in adults under 50. If you have a family member with IBS, your odds of getting IBS or IBS-D go up. With IBS, your colon is more sensitive than normal. It can react to things like stress, bacteria, and even certain foods. Your brain also plays a role and may respond too much to signals that control your colon. The result: Your intestines squeeze too hard, making food move too quickly through your system. That can cause pain, diarrhea, and other problems like gas.', 'How Is IBS-D Diagnosed? There isn’t a test that tells you if you have IBS-D (or any kind of IBS). Instead, your doctor will look at your health history and symptoms. If you’ve had abdominal pain and other signs of IBS for at least 3 months, you may have it. If you have other symptoms, like rectal bleeding, weight loss, or a family history of gastrointestinal cancer, your doctor may want you to have tests to rule out other possibilities. These can include a blood test to check for celiac disease and a colonoscopy to check for abnormal growths and signs of cancer. (During a colonoscopy, doctors use medication to sedate you, then insert a tube with a tiny camera into your rectum and your large intestine to see if it’s healthy.)', 'How Is IBS-D Treated? Getting relief from your IBS-D may take some detective work. You’ll probably need to try several strategies and use many different techniques at a time. Make sure your doctor is in the picture. They can work with you to find an effective plan.', 'Possible treatments include: Diet changes: Foods and beverages don’t cause IBS-D, but some may trigger your symptoms or make them worse. Alcohol, drinks with caffeine (like coffee and soda), carbonated drinks, chocolate, sorbitol (an artificial sweetener used in some gums and mints), fried food, and milk products may make IBS-related diarrhea worse. Fiber can be helpful for people who suffer from IBS with constipation (IBS-C). But if you have IBS-D, too much fiber can make your symptoms worse. A low\xa0FODMAP diet is often a choice.\xa0A form of low carb diet, it\xa0limits carbs that are ""fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharides and polyols"" and are notoriously hard to digest. You may need to experiment to figure out which types of whole grains, beans, fruits, and vegetables agree with your gut. Be sure to drink at least six to eight glasses of water a day because diarrhea can cause dehydration. Stress relief: The link between stress and IBS is complicated. Stress and related issues like anxiety and depression don’t cause IBS. But they can make symptoms like diarrhea worse. That’s why it’s important to try to find effective ways to manage your mood.', 'Exercise can help you feel better and improve the way your bowel functions, too. Massage, yoga, hypnotherapy, and forms of talk therapy can help with stress, which may lessen your symptoms. Over-the-counter medications :Anti-diarrhea medications like loperamide (Imodium) may help. Peppermint oil supplements may reduce cramping. Some experts believe probiotics (“good” bacteria, which you can get in supplement form or from foods like pickles and sauerkraut) can help relieve IBS symptoms, including diarrhea. Prescription medications: There are several options your doctor can prescribe. Anticholinergic dicyclomine (Bentyl) slows bowel contractions that lead to diarrhea.Hyoscyamine (Levsin) acts in much the same way. An antidepressant may be an option if your IBS-D causes a lot of pain or if you’re feeling depression or anxiety. Low doses of antidepressants may block pain signals to the brain. Anti-anxiety drugs may work if you feel anxious right before your symptoms come on. Your doctor may suggest medicines like clonazepam (Klonopin), diazepam (Valium), and lorazepam (Ativan)to calm you down.They’re usually only given for a short time since they have a higher risk of addiction.', 'Alosetron hydrochloride (Lotronex) is specifically for women with IBS who are not having success with other treatments. It can help relieve stomach pain and diarrhea, but there are potentially serious side effects. Eluxadoline (Viberzi) may help reduce bowel contractions, belly cramps, and diarrhea. It’s also important to note that this is classified as a Schedule IV controlled substance. This means, among other things, that you’ll have to have a new prescription from your doctor each time you need it. Rifaximin (Xifaxan) is an antibiotic that can decrease bacterial overgrowth and diarrhea. You take it for 2 weeks at a time. The treatment can be repeated up to two times if the symptoms come back.']"
2,Interstitial Cystitis,"['Interstitial cystitis (IC), often called painful bladder syndrome, is a tricky condition. It’s tough to diagnose, and though treatments can make life with it better, there’s no cure. Because IC has such a wide range of symptoms and severity, most experts think it might be several diseases. If you have urinary pain that lasts for more than 6 weeks and is not caused by other conditions like infection or kidney stones, you may have IC. No matter what it’s called, interstitial cystitis symptoms bring a lot of challenges. The disease can affect your social life, exercise, sleep, and even your ability to work. Despite this, you can still arm yourself with facts and treatments to keep symptoms in check.', 'What Is It? IC is a chronic bladder problem. Your bladder holds pee after your kidneys have filtered it but before you pee it out. This condition causes pain and pressure below your belly button. Symptoms can come and go. Or they may be constant. Interstitial cystitis causes urgent, often painful bathroom trips. You may have to pee as many as 40-60 times a day in severe cases. It can even keep you up at night.', 'What Are the Symptoms? These vary from person to person with IC. They can change every day or week or linger for months or years. They might even go away without any treatment. Common symptoms: Bladder pressure and pain that gets worse as your bladder fills up. Pain in your lower tummy, lower back, pelvis, or urethra (the tube that carries pee from your bladder out of your body) For women, pain in the vulva, vagina , or the area behind the vagina For men, pain in the scrotum, testicles, penis , or the area behind the scrotum The need to pee often (more than the normal 7-8 times daily) The feeling you need to pee right now, even right after you go For women, pain during sex For men, pain during orgasm or after sex The bladder pain people feel with IC can range from a dull ache to piercing pain. Peeing may feel like just a little sting, or it can feel like serious burning. About 5% to 10% of people with the condition get ulcers in their bladder. Things that might make symptoms worse: Some foods or drinks Mental or physical stress Your period', 'Who Gets Interstitial Cystitis? As many as 90% of people with IC are women. Somewhere between about 3% to 6% of adult women have some form of IC. That’s about 3 million to 8 million American women. About 1.3% of American men also have it. On average, people first start having problems in their 40s. The risk of getting it goes up as you get older.', 'What Causes IC? It’s not clear why it happens, but there are several ideas: A problem with bladder tissue lets things in your pee irritate your bladder. Inflammation causes your body to release chemicals that cause symptoms. Something in your urine damages your bladder. A nerve problem makes your bladder feel pain from things that usually don’t hurt. Your immune system attacks the bladder. Another condition that causes inflammation is also targeting the bladder.', 'How Is It Diagnosed? There’s no test for interstitial cystitis. If you go to your doctor complaining about bladder pain along with frequency and the urgency to pee, the next step is to rule out what else it could be.', 'Both men and women would first need to rule out urinary tract infections, bladder cancer, sexually transmitted diseases, and kidney stones . In women, endometriosis is another possibility. For men, IC can be mistaken for an inflamed prostate or chronic pelvic pain syndrome. These tests can rule out other conditions: Urinalysis and urine culture. You’ll be asked to pee in a cup. It’ll be sent to a lab to check for infection. Postvoid residual urine volume. Using an ultrasound , this test measures the amount of pee that remains in your bladder after you go to the bathroom. Cystoscopy. A thin tube with a camera is used to see the inside of the bladder and urethra. This is usually done only if there is blood in your pee or if treatment doesn’t help. Bladder and urethra biopsy . A small piece of tissue is taken and tested. This is usually done during cystoscopy. Bladder stretching. Your bladder is filled with liquid or gas to stretch it out. You’ll be asleep under anesthesia. Sometimes this is also used as a treatment. This is done with a cystoscopy. Prostate fluid culture (in men). Your doctor will need to press on your prostate and milk a sample to test. This is not commonly done.', 'Home or Lifestyle Treatments For about half the cases, interstitial cystitis goes away by itself. Among those who need treatment, most find relief and get their lives back to normal. Treatment is mainly about symptom control. It takes trial and error to find the right combination of treatments. And it usually takes weeks or months to calm the symptoms. The first stage of treatment is to try to avoid triggers and try lifestyle changes that may help ease symptoms. Retrain your bladder to hold more urine. For example, if you feel the need to pee every 30 minutes, try to stretch it out to 45 minutes. Cut down on stress. It can be a trigger. Taking 5 minutes a day to do something for yourself can be a start. Stretch, read a book. Relaxation techniques, talking to a friend, or meditation may help. Wear loose clothing. Tight clothes can put pressure on your bladder. Do low-impact exercise . For example, walk or stretch. Change what you eat and drink to avoid triggers. See below for examples of possible trigger foods and drinks. If you smoke, quit.', 'A lot of people find that certain foods or drinks irritate their bladders. You don’t have to cut these all out at once. Notice when your symptoms are bad and think back on if you ate or drank any of these. It may be a good idea to keep a food and symptom journal. Take note of what you have each day and how you feel. You can look back to see if there are connections. Not all of these will bother every person. Common triggers: Citrus fruits like oranges and lemons Tomatoes Chocolate Caffeinated drinks like coffee and sodas Carbonated drinks Alcohol Spicy foods Artificial sweeteners Talk to your doctor about an elimination diet, which could help you figure out what’s affecting your bladder.', 'Second-Line Treatments for Interstitial Cystitis If lifestyle changes aren’t enough, then try the next line of treatments: Physical therapy . Different techniques are used to help relax your pelvic muscles. Amitriptyline . This drug controls bladder spasms . It’s the most widely used oral medication for IC. Pentosan (Elmiron). It’s not clear how this drug works, but it might help rebuild the bladder tissue lining. It can take a few months to relieve symptoms. Hydroxyzine . This drug is an antihistamine and can be helpful if you have to pee a lot at night. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). For people who haven’t found relief through other drugs, this drug is placed in the bladder with a catheter. It’s believed to work by fighting inflammation and blocking pain. Doctors don’t often recommend it because it may temporarily worsen symptoms and takes multiple doctor visits.', 'Third-Line Treatments for Interstitial Cystitis If second-line treatments don’t work, your doctor will likely turn to the third-line treatments. They require cytoscopy, a special scope used to look at the bladder, often in an operating room under anesthesia. If you haven’t been seen by a urologist, a doctor who specializes in treating bladder problems, your doctor may refer you to one now. Bladder stretching. Slowly stretching the bladder wall with fluid may help relieve symptoms. If it’s helpful, the effect usually lasts less than 6 months. Repeat treatment may help. Steroids . If you have ulcers called Hunner’s lesions on your bladder, a doctor may remove them, burn them, or inject them with steroids.', 'Fourth-Line Treatments for Interstitial Cystitis If lifestyle changes, medications, and the procedures mentioned above aren’t enough, and your symptoms badly affect your quality of life, an urologist may try the fourth line of treatments: Neurostimulation. The doctor implants a device that delivers small electrical shocks to your nerves to change how they work. OnabotulinumtoxinA ( Botox ) injections. This temporarily paralyzes the bladder muscle to help relieve some of the pain.', 'Final Steps in Interstitial Cystitis Treatment When all else fails, here’s what you could try: Cyclosporine . This drug suppresses your immune system . Surgery. In very rare cases when nothing else works, this may be an option. This is a complex operation that diverts your urine away from your bladder. Even if IC treatments don’t work for you, pain management using painkillers, acupuncture , or other methods can keep symptoms at bay.']"
3,What Is Torticollis?,"['Torticollis is a condition of the neck muscles that causes the head to tilt down. The term comes from two Latin words: tortus, which means twisted, and collum, which means neck . Sometimes it’s called “wryneck” or “loxia.” If your baby has the condition at birth, it’s called congenital muscular torticollis. That’s the most common type. Congenital forms of torticollis are usually painless. Babies can also develop infant torticollis after birth. Then it’s called “acquired,” rather than congenital. Acquired torticollis may be linked to other, more serious medical issues, and it could be quite painful. Adults can also develop wryneck after a head or neck injury. Or, the condition might occur as a side effect of certain medications. If your baby has acquired torticollis, there are stretching exercises that may help. (Photo credit: Eric Olson/WebMD)', 'Torticollis Causes You have a long muscle on each side of your neck that runs from the back of your ear to your collarbone. It is called the sternocleidomastoid, or SCM. When your baby has torticollis, this ropy muscle is shortened on one side. Why does the muscle become shortened? Your baby might have been cramped in the womb or may have been in an abnormal position, such as a breech position. That can put extra pressure on one side of your infant ’s head, which can cause the SCM to tighten.', 'If your doctor used forceps or a vacuum device during delivery, those also might have put pressure on your baby’s SCM. Torticollis causes in infants Your baby’s womb position and the tools used during their delivery aren’t the only reasons behind congenital torticollis. Other possible causes include: An abnormal development in the SCM Klippel-Feil syndrome (a rare birth defect that causes the vertebrae in your baby’s neck to fuse) Hematoma (a buildup of blood in your baby’s neck muscles) Fibrosis (thickening of your baby’s muscle tissue) Some possible causes of acquired torticollis are: Swelling in your child’s throat, which could be triggered by an infection, injury, or unknown cause Vision problems Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD: a condition where stomach acid irritates the lining of the tube that connects your mouth and stomach) A reaction to certain medicines Scar tissue Arthritis in the neck Sandifer syndrome (a movement disorder that causes muscle spasms due to acid reflux) Grisel’s syndrome (a rare side effect of surgeries that involve the head, neck, ear, nose, or throat)', 'Many times, wryneck occurs without any known cause. Doctors call this idiopathic torticollis. Torticollis causes in adults A type of torticollis, called cervical dystonia or spasmodic torticollis, typically affects adults. This form causes a person’s neck muscles to spasm. Some possible causes of cervical dystonia are: A head or neck injury A reaction to medications used to treat depression or other mental health conditions An inherited genetic mutation', 'Torticollis Symptoms Torticollis symptoms in infants You may not notice anything unusual about your baby for the first 6 or 8 weeks. It’s common for torticollis symptoms to become obvious once an infant gains more control of the head and neck. Some of the symptoms you might see: Your child’s head tilts to one side with their chin pointed to the opposite shoulder . In about 75% of babies with torticollis, the right side is affected. Their head doesn’t turn side to side or up and down easily. You feel a soft lump in your baby’s neck muscle. This isn’t dangerous and usually goes away within 6 months. Your baby prefers to look over the shoulder at you. Their eyes don’t follow you because that would require turning their head. Your baby has\xa0trouble breastfeeding on one side or prefers to feed on one side only. Your baby works hard to turn toward you, struggles to turn their head all the way, and becomes upset because the movement is hard. They\xa0might start getting a flat head on one or both sides, from lying in one position all the time. This is called “positional plagiocephaly.” One of your baby’s shoulders is higher than the other. Your baby has muscle tightness or stiffness. Your baby has swollen neck muscles. You notice that your baby has uneven facial features. For example, one eye might appear lower than the other.', 'Symptoms of acquired torticollis may include: Your child has severe neck pain or headaches. Their head tilts to one side, while their chin tilts to the other. Your child’s neck muscles are tight, stiff, or swollen. You notice that your child has limited movement in their head and neck. One of your child’s shoulders is higher than the other. Your child has head tremors (shaking or trembling movements). Torticollis symptoms in adults Some possible signs of torticollis in adults are: Spasms or tremors that cause your muscles to twitch, jerk, or shake Tense neck muscles Pain or burning in your shoulders, neck, or back Headaches Tilting your head forward, backward, or side to side Bending your neck and head forward, backward, or side to side Turning your head', 'Torticollis Diagnosis If you notice signs that look like your baby might have torticollis, set up an exam with your doctor. The doctor will start by checking how far your baby’s head will turn. They also may order imaging scans, such as X-rays, CT scans, MRIs, and ultrasound , to check for other conditions. A special test, called an electromyogram (EMG), can reveal which muscles are most affected. Blood tests are also used to rule out other conditions that are linked to torticollis. About 1 in 5 babies with torticollis will also have a hip problem.', 'Most babies with torticollis don’t have other medical problems. But it is sometimes linked to infections, broken bones, allergic reactions to medicines, or genetic conditions such as Down syndrome or Klippel-Feil syndrome. To diagnose torticollis in adults, doctors will typically perform a physical exam, ask about your family history, and assess your symptoms. Tests, such as MRI and EMG, usually aren’t necessary unless your doctor thinks your spinal cord is compressed or you have nerve damage. It’s important not to ignore symptoms that may be serious. Meningitis, a condition that causes inflammation of the membranes that cover your brain and spinal cord, may look like torticollis. You should get medical help right away if you experience symptoms of meningitis, such as: A sudden, high fever Chills A stiff neck Severe headache Confusion or trouble concentrating A skin rash', 'Torticollis Complications If you act early, you can help prevent any long-term effects of torticollis for your baby. Without treatment, your baby might get complications, including: Less control of their head Limited reach on the affected side and less tracking with the eyes Delays in sitting and walking A problem feeding Poor balance Crooked crawling Rolling onto one side only Facial deformities Flat head syndrome (from lying on the same side too much) Motor skill delays Problems with hearing and vision Torticollis in adults is linked to these complications: Balance problems Changes in the way you walk Bone spurs (bony lumps that develop on the edge of bones) A more serious underlying condition, such as an injury, tumor, or infection A disability that interferes with your everyday life Emotional issues', 'Torticollis Treatment Torticollis treatment in infants If your baby has acquired torticollis, treatment will focus on the condition that’s causing it. Most cases of congenital torticollis can be treated with stretching exercises or position changes that you can perform at home. The doctor may teach you some specific exercises to do with your little one. These moves will help lengthen the tighter, shorter muscle and also strengthen the muscle on the opposite side. Once torticollis is diagnosed and stretching exercises start, most babies improve within 6 months. Two things can speed up recovery: an early diagnosis and sticking to the treatment plan. Here are some other things you can do at home: Use your baby’s appetite as an incentive. Offer the bottle or your breast in a way that gets them to turn away from the favored side. Place toys so that your baby is forced to look both ways. Those with sounds and lights are really good at drawing their attention. Get them to play with their hands and feet. Babies like to bring their hands together and their feet up to their hands. When your baby does this, it builds up muscles they will need to crawl. Give them plenty of time on your tummy. Holding your baby this way will strengthen their back and neck muscles and keep the back of their head from flattening. Ideally, they should have 15 minutes of tummy time four times a day. You can support them on your chest, across your lap, or on a pillow if that makes it easier.', 'In addition to home treatment, your doctor may want your baby to see a physical therapist. Very rarely, children with torticollis will need surgery to lengthen the SCM muscle. Doctors will usually wait until your child is a preschooler to consider this option. Torticollis treatment in adults Treatment for torticollis in adults may depend on the cause. Some possible options include: Physical therapy, which may include heat therapy, massage, and traction devices to relieve pain Stretching exercises Braces or other devices to keep the neck in place Medicines, such as baclofen, to help with muscle spasms Anti-inflammatories to keep pain at bay Botox injections Trigger point injections Spine surgery if the condition is due to a vertebral dislocation Here are some home remedies that may help improve your symptoms: Stretch your neck muscles Apply hot and cold therapy Get enough rest Touch the opposite side of your face, neck, or chin to temporarily stop spasms Reduce stress', 'Torticollis Prevention While there’s no way to prevent torticollis in babies, you can avoid complications if you treat it early and stick to your treatment plan. Adults may be able to lessen their risk of torticollis if they avoid neck injuries and strains. It’s also helpful to practice good posture and perform stretching exercises often. You might not be able to completely prevent torticollis, but prompt treatment can keep the condition from getting worse.', 'Takeaways Torticollis can be present in babies at birth, acquired later in childhood, or even affect adults. It’s usually treated with at-home stretches and positioning. If these therapies aren’t successful for you or your child, let your doctor know. Other options may work better.', 'Torticollis FAQs How serious is torticollis? Torticollis is a relatively common condition that usually responds well to treatment. Rarely, torticollis can be a sign that you have a more serious underlying medical condition, such as a tumor, injury, or infection. Does torticollis go away on its own? Although torticollis can go away on its own, babies often need treatment to stretch their muscles. You should see your doctor for regular checkups to assess your baby’s progress. What causes torticollis in babies? There are lots of possible causes. The way your baby was positioned in the womb before birth is one. Other reasons include a problem with the muscles and nerves in the neck or a birth condition.', 'Should I be worried if my baby has torticollis? You shouldn’t worry if your doctor tells you your baby has torticollis. Most of the time, the condition usually doesn’t cause any pain and shouldn’t pose long-term issues if treated promptly. What triggers torticollis? The way babies are positioned in the womb before birth can trigger congenital torticollis. Swelling in a child’s throat can prompt acquired torticollis. In adults, a head or neck injury can sometimes be the culprit.']"
4,When Should I Use Heat or Ice for Pain?,"['Heat boosts the flow of blood and nutrients to an area of the body. It often works best for morning stiffness or to warm up muscles before activity. Cold slows blood flow, reducing swelling and pain . It’s often best for short-term pain, like that from a sprain or a strain. But does it matter which one you use for an injury? This article will help you sort it out.', 'When Either Heat Or Cold Will Do Soothe aches and pains caused by conditions like osteoarthritis , rheumatoid arthritis , back pain , fibromyalgia , and neck pain with either heat or cold. Each can give you relief from these symptoms: Muscle aches, spasms, and pains Lower and upper back pain Stiff, swollen, or tender joints Neck stiffness Finger, hand , or wrist pain Knee pain For short-term pain relief of any of these conditions, apply a hot or cold compress using any of these items: An electric heating pad A gel pack that can be microwaved or frozen A bag of ice or frozen vegetables A washcloth or small towel soaked in hot or cold water (wring it out, fold it, and apply to the sore area)', 'Whether you use heat or cold, be sure to wrap the pack in a thin towel to help protect your skin . Apply to the painful area for 15-20 minutes several times each day. Whether you use heat or cold, you may notice your skin looks a little pinker after applying the compress. That’s normal, but let your skin return to its normal color and temperature before applying fresh ice or heat. Call your doctor if you notice any of the following signs after removing the compress. These symptoms mean the temperature was too extreme and may have caused skin damage: Skin that’s purplish-red, dark red, or a spotty red and white color Hives Swelling Blisters', ""Hydrotherapy Showers and baths aren't just for mornings. When you're hurting, stand under or settle into warm water for a few minutes to help soothe and relax you. (If you're over 70 or have heart problems, check with your doctor before getting into a hot tub.)"", 'Try a warm shower or bath before you exercise to help loosen joints and muscles. Use cool water after exercise to help calm deep, burning pain and reduce inflammation . Or you can mix it up with a contrast bath to increase blood flow, reduce pain and swelling, and promote healing. Get two tubs or containers large enough for your painful area ready with warm and cold water. Soak in the warm tub for about 5 minutes and then plunge into the cold tub for about 1 minute. Go back to the warm for a few more minutes and then the cold for a minute. Repeat four or five times.', 'Warm Clothes Want an easier -- and less painful -- start to your day? Warm your clothes in the dryer for a few minutes before you put them on. The heated garments may help ease morning pain and stiffness.', 'Heat Wraps If heat helps ease your pain, try a continuous low-level heat wrap, available at drugstores. You can wear a heat wrap for up to 8 hours, even while you sleep. Follow the directions carefully. Studies suggest that low-level, long-term heat applied directly on the skin can significantly reduce stiffness and tension and increase flexibility. The effects can last for 48 hours or longer.', 'Heated Wax Therapy Another way to apply heat -- especially to hands, elbows, and feet -- is warm, melted paraffin. You can buy paraffin wax kits at your local drugstore or beauty supply. A heated container safely melts the wax and mineral oil to make a paraffin bath. Dip your achy body part into the bath several times to build up a warm layer. Take it out of the bath, and cover it with plastic and wrap in a towel for 10-15 minutes until the wax cools. Unwrap and peel the wax away. To avoid irritation and pain, make sure the skin that you treat has no cuts or sores.']"
5,What is Chronic Fatigue Syndrome?,"[""Everyone feels fatigued sometimes, and many people feel fatigued a lot of the time. But\xa0myalgic encephalomyelitis /\xa0chronic\xa0fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS)\xa0isn't just being tired. It's a new state of fatigue that has lasted for at least 6 months and can be so severe that it gets in the way of your normal daily activities, at home and at work. Rest and sleep don't seem to help. If you have it, physical activity can leave you feeling worse, typically the next day. This condition is known as post-exertional malaise. You tend to awaken almost every morning feeling as if you didn't get enough sleep. Often you wake up a lot at night, for no apparent reason. You can have trouble concentrating and multi-tasking. When you stand upright from a sitting or lying position, you may feel light-headed. Your heart might beat rapidly.\xa0 After you're on your feet for a while, you could\xa0feel terrible and need to lie down flat. ME/CFS tends to cycle through flare-ups and remissions. You'll have\xa0good days and bad days, although on the good days you won't feel\xa0back to normal.\xa0There isn't any known cure, but different treatments can help the symptoms."", ""Facts about Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome The CDC estimates up to 2.5 million Americans have ME/CFS. Anyone can get it, including children and teens. It's most common in women in their 40s and 50s. Women are\xa0more likely to develop it than men. Most cases are mild or moderate. About 1 in 4 people with the condition have severe symptoms. If you have mild ME/CFS, you can probably manage on your own. Moderate symptoms can make it hard for you to move around. For example, you might need to sleep in the afternoons. Severe symptoms can impact your quality of life and abilities as badly as if you had lupus, heart disease, or rheumatoid arthritis."", ""How Does It Happen? Doctors don't know what causes ME/CFS, but they have identified different underlying abnormalities in people with the condition. Immune system problems: Several parts of the immune system are different in people with ME/CFS. Some research indicates that these abnormalities may cause the symptoms of the illness. Fortunately, people with ME/CFS\xa0don't have a defective immune system\xa0in the way that people with HIV/AIDS do."", ""Energy production: If you have\xa0ME/CFS, the cells in your body have trouble making enough energy. Brain abnormalities: Abnormalities show up\xa0in pictures of the brain (like MRI or CT scans), in levels of brain hormones, and in the brain's electrical system\xa0(brain waves).\xa0These abnormalities can come and go and aren't necessarily permanent. Blood pressure and pulse issues: When you stand, your blood pressure could drop and\xa0your heart might start to beat faster. You might\xa0feel faint or\xa0pass out if your blood pressure drops too low. Genes: Some studies have found abnormalities in the structure of certain genes. Others point to abnormalities in the way certain genes are turned on and off\xa0inside your cells.\xa0Studies of identical and non-identical twins indicate that some people inherit a genetic likelihood of\xa0getting the illness. Infections or other illness: ME/CFS often, but not always, begins with a sudden infectious-like illness (fever, sore throat, aching muscles, upset stomach). Research found that several different types of infectious agents can trigger the beginning of the illness, including Epstein-Barr virus (a common cause of mononucleosis), Lyme disease bacteria, and Q fever bacteria. Serotonin and cortisol: Several studies indicate that serotonin, a major brain chemical, plays an important role\xa0in\xa0ME/CFS symptoms. People with the illness have low levels of cortisol, a hormone the body releases in response to stress."", ""How Can I Find Out If I Have It? The National Academy of Medicine has issued guidelines describing the combination of symptoms necessary for doctors to diagnose the condition. Unfortunately, there isn't yet a diagnostic test that's accurate enough to be useful. Because extreme fatigue is a symptom of so many conditions, your doctor will want to rule out other conditions first, before considering a diagnosis of ME/CFS. You'll need to get a complete checkup and talk with your doctor about all your symptoms.""]"
6,Amyloidosis,"['Amyloidosis is when an abnormal protein called amyloid builds up in your tissues and organs. When it does, it affects their shape and how they work. Amyloidosis is a serious health problem that can lead to life-threatening organ failure.', 'Causes and Types of Amyloidosis Many different proteins can lead to amyloid deposits, but only a few have been linked to major health problems. The type of protein and where it collects tells the type of amyloidosis you have. Amyloid deposits may collect throughout your body or in just one area. The different types of amyloidosis include: AL amyloidosis (immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis). This is the most common type and used to be called primary amyloidosis. AL stands for “amyloid light chains,” which is the type of protein responsible for the condition. There’s no known cause, but it happens when your bone marrow makes abnormal antibodies that can’t be broken down. It’s linked with a blood cancer called multiple myeloma. It can affect your kidneys, heart, liver, intestines, and nerves.', ""AA amyloidosis. Previously known as secondary amyloidosis, this condition is the result of another chronic infectious or inflammatory disease such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn’s disease, or ulcerative colitis. It mostly affects your kidneys, but it can also affect your digestive tract, liver, and heart. AA means the amyloid type A protein causes this type. Dialysis-related amyloidosis (DRA). This is more common in older adults and people who have been on dialysis for more than 5 years. This form of amyloidosis is caused by deposits of beta-2 microglobulin that build up in the blood. Deposits can build up in many different tissues, but it most commonly affects bones, joints, and tendons. Familial, or hereditary, amyloidosis. This is a rare form passed down through families. It often affects the liver, nerves, heart, and kidneys. Many genetic defects are linked to a higher chance of amyloid disease. For example, an abnormal protein like transthyretin (TTR) is usually the cause. Age-related (senile) systemic amyloidosis. This is caused by deposits of normal TTR in the heart and other tissues. It happens most commonly in older men. Organ-specific amyloidosis. This causes deposits of amyloid protein in single organs, including the skin (cutaneous amyloidosis). Though some types of amyloid deposits have been linked to Alzheimer's disease, the brain is rarely affected by amyloidosis that happens throughout your body."", 'Risk Factors for Amyloidosis Men get amyloidosis more often than women. Your risk for amyloidosis goes up as you grow older. Amyloidosis affects 15% of patients with a form of cancer called multiple myeloma. Amyloidosis may also happen in people with end-stage kidney disease who are on dialysis for a long time (see ""Dialysis-related amyloidosis"" above).', 'Symptoms of Amyloidosis Symptoms of amyloidosis are often subtle. They can also vary greatly depending on where the amyloid protein is collecting in the body. It is important to note that the symptoms described below may be due to a variety of health problems. Only your doctor can make a diagnosis of amyloidosis. General symptoms of amyloidosis may include: Changes in skin color Severe fatigue Feeling of fullness Joint pain Low red blood cell count (anemia) Shortness of breath Swelling of the tongue Tingling and numbness in legs and feet Weak hand grip Severe weakness Sudden weight loss', 'Cardiac Amyloidosis (Stiff Heart Syndrome) This condition can cause less blood to flow to your heart muscle. Eventually, your heart will no longer be able to pump normally.', ""Some doctors also call cardiac amyloidosis “stiff heart syndrome.” Others say a stiff heart is actually a symptom of cardiac amyloidosis. Either way, amyloid deposits in your heart can make the muscular walls of your heart stiff. They can also make your heart muscle weaker and affect the electrical rhythm of the heart. Stiff heart syndrome can be serious. It may lead to congestive heart failure if it's not successfully treated. Who’s at risk? Cardiac amyloidosis is more common in men than in women. It’s also more likely to affect older people. People under 40 rarely get the condition. You can inherit stiff heart syndrome. Other things that raise your chances of getting it are: Having untreated high blood pressure Being obese Being over 60 Having gone through menopause What are the symptoms? If amyloidosis affects your heart, some symptoms you might notice are: Shortness of breath when you're doing light activity or lying down An irregular heartbeat Signs of heart failure, including swelling of the feet and ankles, weakness, fatigue, and nausea, among others"", ""These can be signs of other health conditions, too. So see your doctor to figure out what’s going on. How is it diagnosed? Your doctor will ask you about your symptoms and whether anyone in your family has cardiac amyloidosis or other heart conditions. They’ll give you a physical exam, too. The doctor may do several tests to diagnose or rule out cardiac amyloidosis, like: Blood and urine tests Imaging tests to see inside your body, like ultrasound, echocardiogram, electrocardiogram, MRI, or CT scan Biopsy Genetic testing, if cardiac amyloidosis runs in your family What are the treatments? There’s more than one type of cardiac amyloidosis. Your treatment will depend on the type you have. Among the options your doctor might recommend are: Medications, including chemotherapy and immunotherapy A pacemaker A stem cell transplant While some of these treatments, like chemo and immunotherapy, are also used to treat cancer, cardiac amyloidosis isn't cancer. It's a disease that affects the heart muscle. There's no cure, but there are treatments for most types of cardiac amyloidosis. Getting an early diagnosis is important since treatment can prevent permanent damage."", 'Renal (Kidney) Amyloidosis Your kidneys filter waste and toxins from your blood. Amyloid deposits in the kidneys make it hard for them to do this job. When your kidneys do not work properly, water and dangerous toxins build up in your body. If amyloidosis affects the kidneys, you may have: Signs of kidney failure, including swelling of the feet and ankles and puffiness around the eyes High levels of protein in your urine', 'Gastrointestinal Amyloidosis Amyloid deposits along your gastrointestinal (GI) tract slow down the movement of food through your intestines. This interferes with digestion. If amyloidosis affects your GI tract, you may have: Less appetite Diarrhea Nausea Stomach pain Weight loss If your liver is affected, that can cause liver enlargement and fluid buildup in the body.', ""Amyloid Neuropathy Amyloid deposits can damage the nerves outside your brain and spinal cord, called the peripheral nerves. The peripheral nerves carry information between your brain and spinal cord and the rest of your body. For example, they make your brain perceive pain if you burn your hand or stub your toes. If amyloidosis affects your nerves, you may have: Balance problems Problems controlling your bladder and bowel Sweating problems Tingling and weakness Lightheadedness when standing due to a problem with your body's ability to control blood pressure"", ""Diagnosing Amyloidosis A thorough physical exam and a detailed and accurate account of your medical history are crucial in helping your doctor diagnose amyloidosis. Blood and urine tests can spot abnormal proteins. Depending on your symptoms, your doctor may also check your thyroid and liver. Your doctor will do a biopsy to confirm a diagnosis of amyloidosis and know the specific type of protein you have. The tissue sample for the biopsy may be taken from your belly fat (the abdominal fat pad), bone marrow, or sometimes your mouth, rectum, or other organs. It's not always necessary to biopsy the part of the body damaged by the amyloid deposits. Imaging tests can also help. They show the amount of damage to organs like your heart, liver, or spleen. Your doctor will do a genetic test if they think you have a type that is passed down through families. Treatment for hereditary amyloidosis is different from treatment for other types of the disease. Once you’re diagnosed, your doctor might check your heart with an echocardiogram or your liver and spleen with imaging tests."", 'Amyloidosis Treatment There is no cure for amyloidosis. Your doctor will prescribe treatments to slow the development of the amyloid protein and manage your symptoms. If amyloidosis is related to another condition, then treatment will include targeting that underlying condition. Specific treatment depends on what type of amyloidosis you have and how many organs are affected. High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant can help remove the substance that leads to amyloid formation in some people with primary AL amyloidosis. Chemotherapy medicines alone may be used to treat other patients with primary AL amyloidosis. Secondary (AA) amyloidosis is treated by controlling the underlying disorder and with powerful anti-inflammatory medicines called steroids, which fight inflammation. A liver transplant may treat\xa0the disease if you have certain types of hereditary amyloidosis. New therapies can slow the production of the abnormal protein TTR. Your doctor might also recommend a kidney transplant. Other treatments to help with symptoms include: Diuretic medicine to remove extra water from your body Thickeners to add to fluids to prevent choking if you have trouble swallowing Compression stockings to relieve swelling in your legs or feet Changes to what you eat, especially if you have gastrointestinal amyloidosis', 'What to Expect Amyloidosis can be deadly, especially if it affects your heart or kidneys. Early diagnosis and treatment are important and can help improve survival. Researchers continue to question why some types of amyloid make people sick and how the formation of amyloid can be stopped. Studies to find new treatments are ongoing. If you have amyloidosis, consider asking your doctor if there are any clinical trials you can join, or search for one by visiting www.clinicaltrials.gov and typing in the search term ""amyloidosis.""']"
7,Ichthyosis,"[""What Is Ichthyosis? Ichthyosis is a skin disorder in which skin cells don't properly separate or shed. This leaves behind rough, dark, scaly skin. (Photo credit: Science Source) Ichthyosis is a group of about 30 skin conditions that cause skin dryness and scaling. The condition gets its name from the Greek word for fish because the skin looks like fish scales. You might also hear it called fish scale or fish skin disease. People with this condition lose the protective barrier that keeps moisture in their skin. They also make new skin cells too quickly or shed old cells too slowly. This leads to a buildup of thick, scaly skin. Most cases of ichthyosis are mild, but it can be more severe. Some types of ichthyosis can affect your other organs, too. Ichthyosis can't be cured, but treatments can relieve the scaling and make you feel more comfortable."", ""Types of Ichthyosis Some types only cause dry and scaly skin. Others cause problems inside the body, too. Ichthyosis has lots of types—more than 30. Most forms of the disease are very rare. They can go along with other conditions or syndromes. Some types include: Ichthyosis vulgaris . It's mild and affects about one out of every 250 people. Gray, brown, or white scales can show up usually in infancy. Most people with ichthyosis have this type. X-linked recessive ichthyosis. It affects about one out of 6,000 people, usually males. It starts at about 3-6 months and gets worse over time. You'll usually see scaling on the neck, face, trunk, and legs. Harlequin ichthyosis. You'll usually see this in newborns. It causes thick scaly plates all over the skin. It can change the way a newborn's face looks and can make it hard to move their joints. Epidermolytic ichthyosis. This type also happens in new babies. Infants with this type have fragile, blistered skin all over their bodies. Later, the blisters go away, and the skin gets scaly. Lamellar ichthyosis. Newborns with this have a clear membrane (collodion membrane) all over their bodies. After a few weeks, this covering peels away, leaving big, dark, plate-like scales. Congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma. This type is there at birth, too. Babies with this may also have a collodion membrane. Erythrokeratodermia variabilis. This type shows up in babies after a few months and can get worse or spread as they grow. Your skin may look rough, thick, or red, especially on the face, butt, arms, and legs. Progressive symmetric erythrokeratoderma. This type can start later in childhood compared with other types. You'll see dry, red, scaly skin, especially on the arms, legs, butt, face, ankles, and wrists."", ""Ichthyosis Causes Ichthyosis can be genetic (or inherited). It also can be acquired, meaning it happens later because of another illness or from medicine you're taking. Inherited ichthyosis is a genetic condition. That means it's passed down to you from your parents. Sometimes, parents who don't have ichthyosis can still pass it down. Genes are the codes that tell your body to make proteins, which determine how your body looks and functions. When there are changes or mutations in a gene, it can cause disease. Ichthyosis gene mutations affect the proteins that protect your skin and keep it moist. They also affect how quickly your body gets rid of or grows new skin cells. Ichthyosis usually shows up in infancy or early childhood. If both of your parents have a mutation that can cause it, you're likely to have a more serious condition than if only one of them has it. Sometimes, ichthyosis is genetic without being inherited. This can happen when a new mutation comes up in a developing fetus. In this case, the baby won't have enough of a protein (filaggrin) they need for their outer skin layer. They also won't shed dead skin cells the way they should."", ""Acquired ichthyosis shows up in adulthood. Doctors don't know why it happens, but people with it often have other conditions, including: Underactive thyroid gland Kidney disease Sarcoidosis , a rare disease that causes patches of inflammation inside the body Cancer such as Hodgkin's lymphoma HIV infection Some medicines might also trigger the condition, but it's rare. These include: Cancer drugs, such as hydroxyurea ( Droxia , Hydrea ) and vemurafenib ( Zelboraf ) Protease inhibitors, a group of drugs used to treat HIV infections Nicotinic acid , a vitamin that's used to treat high cholesterol Medicines for ulcers and acid reflux, such as cimetidine Clofazimine, which treats leprosy"", ""Ichthyosis Symptoms Your symptoms will depend on what type of ichthyosis it is. But 95% of people with it have ichthyosis vulgaris. It's possible to have ichthyosis and not even know it. You might just think you have dry skin. Dry, scaly skin is the main symptom. The scales form on only some parts of the body, such as the: Trunk Stomach Buttocks Legs Face and scalp"", ""The scales can be white, gray, or dark brown. They might have thick or thin cracks running through them. Dryness and scaling get worse in cold, dry weather. They usually improve in warmer weather. Other signs of ichthyosis vulgaris, the most common type, include: Itchy, dry skin Skin that's thick or rough and may look dirty, especially on the palms of your hands and soles of your feet White, gray, or brown scales Extra lines on the hands and feet that may be deep or even crack Rough and bumpy skin on the arms, thighs, and butt that may look like acne (keratosis pilaris) Trouble sweating Other, more severe signs of ichthyosis are: Skin redness Blisters that can break to cause wounds Peeling Itchiness Pain Lines on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet Tight skin that makes it hard to move Hair loss or hair that breaks easily Dry eyes that are hard to close Trouble hearing Trouble bending your joints Many people with ichthyosis also have eczema , a red, itchy rash . Ichthyosis usually shows up in babies or young kids before age 5. Symptoms may get worse until a child reaches puberty. Sometimes, it can get better with age. Your symptoms will depend on how severe your disease is and what's causing it. It usually doesn't go away, and you may need treatment to help with symptoms all your life."", ""Ichthyosis Complications Skin is your body's barrier. It holds moisture inside and keeps out bacteria and other invaders that might make you sick. When ichthyosis makes pieces of your skin scale off, you lose some of this protective layer. Scaling can lead to complications such as: Skin infections Dehydration Blocked sweat glands, which can lead to overheating Slow hair growth from scales on the scalp or hair loss Burning more calories because the skin has to work harder to turn over cells Ichthyosis can cause emotional issues, too. The scales can affect the way you look. People with this condition sometimes feel depressed and have low self-esteem. Kids with ichthyosis are more likely to get: Eczema Asthma Hay fever Hives Men with ichthyosis are also at an increased risk of: Testicular cancer Undescended or hidden testicles Low sperm count Other complications include: Vision loss from damage to the cornea (the clear layer in the front of the eye ) Hearing loss Brain and nervous system problems"", ""Ichthyosis Diagnosis Sometimes it's so mild that it looks like regular dry skin . If the dryness and scaling bother you, see a dermatologist—a doctor who treats skin problems —for treatment. They may: Ask if other people in your family have any skin problems. Look at your skin, hair, and nails. Take a sample of skin to check under a microscope. This is called a biopsy . Test your blood or saliva for gene changes that cause certain types of ichthyosis."", ""Ichthyosis Treatment It can't be cured, but treatments can help you manage dry and scaly skin. Rub cream, lotion, or ointment onto your skin every day to add moisture. Look for rich creams that have any of these ingredients: lanolin , alpha hydroxy acids, urea, or propylene glycol. Products with ceramides or cholesterol also keep skin moist. Apply the lotion right after you step out of the shower or bath, while your skin is still damp. This will help hold in moisture. Other things you can try: Take more than one bath a day to hydrate your skin. Take baths in salt water to help with burning, stinging, or itching. If you get infections often, try adding a little bit of bleach to your baths. Rub your skin with a pumice stone or rough sponge to help get rid of dead skin. Remove dead skin with a product that contains salicylic acid , glycolic acid, or lactic acid ."", ""If the dryness and scaling are severe, your doctor might prescribe an oral retinoid medicine such as acitretin ( Soriatane ) or isotretinoin ( Absorica , Claravis , Sotret , and others). Retinoids can cause side effects such as weakened bones, dry mouth , and upset stomach . You might need antibiotics for skin infections. If your skin condition is caused by another condition or medicine you're taking, treating the disease or changing the dose may help. Ichthyosis isn't life-threatening, but it can be life-changing. Your dermatologist can recommend treatments to help your skin look and feel better. If you feel depressed or have low self-esteem, talk to a therapist or other mental health experts."", ""Ichthyosis Prevention You can't make ichthyosis go away. But there's a lot you can do to make it feel better and help with your symptoms. Some steps you can take include: Taking baths or other steps to add moisture to your skin. Staying cool. Heat and sweat can make it worse. Use a humidifier to keep heat and air conditioning from drying out your skin. Wear loose clothes that are cotton or another fabric that doesn't bother your skin. Avoid laundry detergents or other products with dyes and perfumes. It always helps to find other people with the same condition. They can be a source of support and have ideas for things to try. Look for a support group online or where you live with other people who have ichthyosis. If you're struggling with your skin condition, reach out to a mental health professional.""]"
8,Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia,"[""Autoimmune hemolytic anemia , or AIHA, is a rare type of anemia . When you have anemia, your bone marrow doesn't make enough red blood cells . Or these cells don't work as well as they should. Red blood cells carry oxygen to your body. When you have too few red blood cells, your body can't get enough oxygen, leaving you feeling tired or short of breath."", 'What is AIHA? Red blood cells are made in the spongy material called bone marrow deep inside your bones. These blood cells normally live for about 120 days. If you have autoimmune hemolytic anemia, your body’s immune system attacks and destroys red blood cells faster than your bone marrow can make new ones. Sometimes these red blood cells live for only a few days. Most people who get AIHA are middle-aged or older. It’s rare in children, and it usually shows up soon after a viral illness and goes away on its own. If your teenager gets it, it could be a sign they have some other health problem.', 'Types of AIHA Autoimmune hemolytic anemia is classified in a few different ways: Primary AIHA: Appears by itself Secondary AIHA: Affects you because you have another illness. The disease is also classified by the temperature at which red blood cells are damaged: Warm antibody hemolytic anemia: The immune reaction takes place at or above normal body temperature. Cold antibody hemolytic anemia: Red blood cells are destroyed when you’re exposed to cold.', 'Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia Signs and Symptoms Many of the symptoms of AIHA are the same as those of other forms of anemia. You may have: Chills Fast heartbeat, known as tachycardia Pale skin that may start to yellow Shortness of breath Weakness and fatigue Chest pain Yellow skin or whites of the eyes ( jaundice ) Dark urine A feeling of abdominal fullness related to an enlarged spleen Some symptoms are different depending on which type of AIHA you have. With cold antibody hemolytic anemia, you may also notice: Cold hands and feet Bluish or reddish color in hands and feet Headache Digestive problems Pain in the back and legs', ""AIHA Causes You can get autoimmune hemolytic anemia if you have an autoimmune disease like lupus . Normally when your immune system spots foreign invaders like bacteria and viruses, it makes proteins called antibodies to attack them. When you have AIHA, your immune system makes antibodies that mistakenly attack your own red blood cells. Other diseases and medications can also cause autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Some of these are: Cancers, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia and non- Hodgkin's lymphoma Infections like Mycoplasma pneumoniae Medicines such as penicillin , methyldopa ( Aldomet ), quinine ( Qualaquin ), and sulfonamides Viruses such as Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, HIV , and hepatitis"", 'AIHA Diagnosis If you think you could have any type of anemia, you should talk to your doctor. They may refer you to a hematologist, a doctor who specializes in blood diseases. They’ll most likely discuss your past medical history, medications you take, and talk about your symptoms. They’ll\xa0 also request a blood test called a complete blood count, or CBC , to look for signs of anemia. This test measures: The number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets The size of your red blood cells The protein in your red blood cells that carries oxygen (hemoglobin) How much space red blood cells take up in your blood (hematocrit)', ""A low red blood cell count and low hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are signs of anemia. If your CBC test results point to anemia, the doctor might want to do more tests. You might get one of these: Reticulocyte count. This measures the number of young red blood cells in your body. A high reticulocyte count means your bone marrow is making a lot more cells to replace the ones your body has destroyed. Coombs' test. The doctor will do this test to see if your body is making antibodies against red blood cells. Peripheral smear. Your doctor will check your red blood cells under a microscope for signs of blood cell destruction. Bilirubin test. Levels of this substance rise when blood cells are destroyed. Haptoglobin test. This protein clears debris from damaged red cells out of the bloodstream. Levels will be low when it’s being used heavily. Cold agglutinin titer. The doctor may test your level of these antibodies that attack red blood cells at cold temperatures."", ""Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia Treatment If you have a disease like lupus that’s causing your anemia, your doctor will treat it first. If a medication is the cause, you'll likely have to stop taking that medicine. If your AIHA is mild, you may not need treatment. Doctors usually first prescribe steroids , such as hydrocortisone or prednisone , to stop your immune system from attacking your red blood cells. A medicine called rituximab may make steroids work even better. If you don’t improve, you may need surgery to remove your spleen. That’s where much of the destruction of red blood cells takes place. Other medicines such as azathioprine ( Imuran ) and cyclophosphamide ( Cytoxan ) can be used to suppress the immune system. You may need a blood transfusion.""]"
9,What Causes Asthma? Common Triggers Explained,"['No one really knows what causes asthma . What we do know is that asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways. The causes can vary from person to person. Still, one thing is consistent: When airways come into contact with a trigger, they become inflamed, narrow, and fill with mucus.', ""How Asthma Attacks Happen When you have an asthma attack, your airways narrow and it gets hard to breathe. This can result from spasms of the muscles around the airways, inflammation and swelling of the mucosal membrane that lines them, or high amounts of mucus inside them. You might have shortness of breath, wheeze or cough as your body tries to get rid of mucus. Why do you have asthma and your friend doesn't? No one knows for sure. Allergies play a role for many people, as do genetics. If you or a loved one has asthma, it's important to understand what your triggers are. Once you figure that out, you can take steps to avoid them. As a result, you’ll have fewer and less severe asthma attacks ."", 'Asthma Triggers Some known triggers of asthma attacks include: Allergies Food and food additives Exercise Heartburn Smoking Sinusitis Medications Weather Smoke', 'Allergies Can Cause Asthma Allergies with asthma is a common problem. Eighty percent of people with asthma have allergies to things in the air, like tree, grass, and weed pollens; mold; animal dander; dust mites ; and cockroach droppings. In one study, children with high levels of cockroach droppings in their homes were four times more likely to have childhood asthma than children with low levels. An allergy to dust mites is another common asthma trigger. If you have asthma that’s hard to control, see an allergist to find out if you have allergies. Treating your allergies with medication and avoiding your triggers can help lower the odds of a severe asthma attack.', ""Food and Food Additives Trigger Asthma Food allergies can cause mild to severe life-threatening reactions. They rarely cause asthma without other symptoms. If you have food allergies , asthma can be part of a severe, life-threatening reaction called anaphylaxis . The most common foods associated with allergic symptoms are: Eggs Cow's milk Peanuts Tree nuts Soy Wheat Fish Shrimp and other shellfish Salads Fresh fruits Food preservatives can trigger isolated asthma, especially sulfite additives, like sodium bisulfite, potassium bisulfite, sodium metabisulfite, potassium metabisulfite, and sodium sulfite, which are commonly used in food processing or preparation."", 'Exercise-Induced Asthma For about 80% of people with asthma, a heavy workout can cause airways to narrow. Exercise is often the main asthma trigger. If you have exercise-induced asthma, you will feel chest tightness, cough , and have trouble breathing within the first 5 to 15 minutes of an aerobic workout. For most people, these symptoms go away in the next 30 to 60 minutes of exercise. But up to 50% of people with exercise-induced asthma may have another attack 6 to 10 hours later. A slow warm-up may help prevent this. If you have severe asthma and you’re not active now, talk to your doctor first about how to track your breathing and choose the right activities. When it’s winter, avoid exercising outdoors in very cold weather because the exposure could trigger asthma.', ""Heartburn and Asthma Severe heartburn and asthma often go hand-in-hand. Up to 89% of people with asthma also have severe heartburn (you might hear your doctor call it gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD ). It usually happens at night when you're lying down. Normally, a valve prevents stomach acids from backing up into your esophagus (the tube food goes down when you eat). When you have GERD, this valve doesn't work like it should. Your stomach acids reflux, or back up, into the esophagus. If the acids reach your throat or airways, the irritation and inflammation they cause could trigger an asthma attack."", 'Clues that suggest reflux as the cause of asthma include the start of asthma in adulthood, no family history of asthma, no history of allergies or bronchitis , difficult-to-control asthma, or coughing while lying down. If your doctor suspects this problem, they may recommend specific tests to look for it, change your foods, or offer medications .', ""Smoking and Asthma People who smoke cigarettes are more likely to get asthma. If you smoke with asthma, it may make symptoms like coughing and wheezing worse. Women who smoke during pregnancy raise the risk of wheezing in their babies. Babies whose mothers smoked during pregnancy also have worse lung function. If you have asthma and you're a smoker, quitting is the most important step you can take to protect your lungs ."", 'Sinusitis and Other Upper Respiratory Infections Much like asthma causes inflammation in the lining of your airways, sinusitis causes inflammation in the mucus membranes that line your sinuses . This makes the membranes put out more mucus. If you have asthma and your sinuses get inflamed, your airways may too. Prompt treatment of a sinus infection can relieve asthma symptoms.', ""Infections and Asthma Cold, flu, bronchitis , and sinus can cause an asthma attack. These respiratory infections that trigger asthma can be viral or bacterial. They're a common cause of asthma, especially in children under age 10. You may be more likely to have an attack for up to 2 months after an upper respiratory infection. Anywhere from 20% to 70% of adults with asthma also have sinus disease. Also, 15% to 56% of people with allergic rhinitis ( hay fever ) or sinusitis also have signs of asthma."", ""Medications and Asthma Many people with asthma are sensitive to certain medications that can trigger an asthma attack . If you have asthma , you need to be aware of what other medications may be triggers. You don’t need to avoid these medications unless you know that they’re triggers. But if they have never triggered your asthma , it is still best to take them with caution because a reaction can happen at any time. Below is a list of the most common medications known to trigger asthma or related symptoms. However, if you are prescribed any medication that you think may be causing your asthma to get worse, discuss it with your doctor. Aspirin and other painkillers. About 10% to 20% of people with asthma have sensitivity to aspirin or a group of pain relievers called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and naproxen . These drugs are often used to treat pain and reduce fevers . Asthma attacks caused by any of these medications can be severe and even fatal, so people who have known aspirin-sensitive asthma should avoid them completely. Products with acetaminophen are generally considered safe for people who have asthma, but you should still talk with your doctor about whether to use them. For some people, there is a small possibility that acetaminophen may trigger an asthma attack. If you have an aspirin sensitivity, it is important that you read the labels of all over-the-counter medications used to treat pain, colds and coughs , and fever. Also, inform your doctor so that these medications are not prescribed for you. If you have any questions about whether a certain medication could trigger your asthma, seek advice from your doctor. Beta-blockers. Beta-blockers are commonly prescribed medications used to treat heart conditions, high blood pressure , migraine headache , and, in eye drop form, glaucoma . Your doctor must determine the need for these medications, and you can take a few trial doses to see if they affect your asthma. It is important that you inform all of your health care providers that you have asthma. This includes even your eye doctor. Examples of beta-blockers are Corgard , Inderal , Normodyne , Pindolol , and Trandate . ACE inhibitors . These are used to treat heart disease and high blood pressure . These medications can cause coughs in about 10% of the patients who use them. This cough is not necessarily asthma. But it can be confused with asthma or, in the case of unstable airways, can actually trigger wheeze and chest tightness. If you are prescribed an ACE inhibitor and develop a cough , speak with your doctor. Some ACE inhibitors are Accupril , Aceon , Altace , Captopril , Lotensin , Mavik , Monopril , Prinivil , Tarka , Univasc , Vasotec , and Zestril . If you have severe asthma, talk to your doctor about any medication you’re considering taking, even if it’s an over-the-counter medication.\xa0 If you know that you're sensitive to particular drugs, make sure your doctor notes the problem on your chart. Always talk to your pharmacist about this reaction before you start a new medication."", 'Other Asthma Triggers Irritants. Tobacco smoke, smoke from wood-burning appliances or fireplaces, strong odors from perfumes, cleaning agents, etc., can all trigger asthma. So can air pollution, workplace dust, or fumes from chemicals. Weather. Cold air, changes in temperature, and humidity can cause an attack. Strong emotions. Stress and asthma are often seen together. Anxiety, crying, yelling, stress, anger, or laughing hard can bring on an asthma attack.', 'How Do Triggers Make Asthma Worse? When you have asthma, your airways are always inflamed and sensitive. They react to a variety of external triggers. Contact with these triggers is what causes asthma symptoms. Your airways tighten and get more inflamed, mucus blocks them, and your symptoms get worse. An asthma attack can start right after exposure to a trigger or several days or even weeks later. Reactions to asthma triggers are different for each person and vary from time to time. Something may bother you but not others with asthma. You might have many triggers while they have none. And while avoiding triggers is a good way to control asthma, the best way is to take medications and follow treatments exactly as prescribed by your doctor in your asthma action plan.', 'How Can I Tell What Causes and Triggers My Asthma? Figuring out what was going on around you when you had an attack is the first step to identifying your triggers. Your doctor may also do blood testing or ask you to use a device called a peak flow meter. It measures how much air you exhale and how quickly it comes out. It can alert you to changes in your breathing and the onset of asthma symptoms. Ask your asthma doctor if using a peak flow meter would help you narrow down the causes of your asthma. It can be tough to identify them all, and they can change. For example, you might not have been bothered by tree pollen when you were a child, only to have a problem with it as an adult. Even when you know your triggers, you might have a hard time avoiding them in certain situations. For example, you may notice that your workplace is cleaned with a cleaning product that bothers your lungs. That’s why it’s so important to work closely with the doctor who treats your asthma. They can help you think of strategies to avoid triggers, or at least cut down on the amount of time you spend near them. They can also make sure you have the right medication when an asthma attack does strike.', 'Know When to Get Help Warning signs of a potential asthma attack include: Needing more rescue inhaler medication (such as albuterol). A cough that gets worse. Feeling like you can’t breathe or like someone’s sitting on your chest. Waking up at night feeling like you can’t breathe. Not being able to be active or exercise without getting winded or wheezing. Use your asthma rescue inhaler medication as soon as you start to feel an attack come on. If it doesn’t seem to work and you feel like you still can’t breathe, call 911 so you can get to an emergency room right away. If you have a steroid medicine at home (such as prednisone), you can take it on your way to the ER.']"
10,Rare Types of Anemia,"['Think of your red blood cells as the transport system that carries oxygen to your body’s tissues. When you have anemia , your body doesn’t make enough red blood cells , or these cells don’t work as well as they should. You end up feeling weak, tired , and short of breath. Anemia comes in many forms. Iron-deficiency anemia is most common. Other types of the disease affect only small numbers of people. Here’s a look at some of the rare types of anemia and how they’re treated.', 'Aplastic (or Hypoplastic) Anemia Blood cells are made from stem cells in your bone marrow. When you have aplastic anemia , stem cells in your bone marrow are damaged and can’t make enough new\xa0blood cells. You’re either born with aplastic anemia, meaning you inherited a gene from your parents that caused it, or you develop it (acquired). Acquired aplastic anemia is the more common of the two, and sometimes it’s only temporary.', 'Acquired causes include: Autoimmune diseases such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis Chemicals such as pesticides, arsenic, and benzene Infections including hepatitis , Epstein-Barr virus, and HIV Radiation and chemotherapy treatments for cancer Inherited conditions such as Fanconi anemia, Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, and Diamond-Blackfan anemia, can damage cells and also cause aplastic anemia. Symptoms of aplastic anemia can include everything from shortness of breath and dizziness to headaches , pale skin , chest pain , fast heart rate ( tachycardia ), and cold hands and feet . One way to treat aplastic anemia is with a blood transfusion . You’ll get a donor’s blood through a vein. A stem cell transplant can also treat\xa0aplastic anemia. It replaces the damaged stem cells in your bone marrow with healthy cells.', ""Sideroblastic Anemia In this group of blood disorders , your body can't use iron to make hemoglobin -- the protein that carries oxygen in your blood. The iron buildup causes the formation of abnormal red blood cells called sideroblasts. There are two main types of sideroblastic anemia: Acquired sideroblastic anemia can be\xa0caused by exposure to certain chemicals or drugs ."", ""Hereditary sideroblastic anemia happens when a gene mutation\xa0disrupts normal hemoglobin production. This gene produces “heme,” the part of hemoglobin that carries oxygen. Symptoms for both types include: Chest pain Fast heartbeat, or tachycardia Headaches Trouble breathing Weakness and fatigue Treatment for sideroblastic anemia depends on the cause. If you have acquired anemia, you'll need to avoid the chemical or drug that caused it. Other treatments include vitamin B6 therapy\xa0and bone marrow or stem cell transplants."", ""Myelodysplastic Syndromes Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are diseases that are caused when your bone marrow is damaged and can't make enough healthy blood cells. MDS is a type of cancer ."", 'Some people are born with a gene that causes MDS. These genes are usually passed down from one or both parents. If you have certain inherited syndromes, including Fanconi anemia, Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, Diamond Blackfan anemia, familial platelet disorder, and severe congenital neutropenia , you could be more likely to develop MDS. A small number of people also get MDS after radiation or chemotherapy treatment for cancer . Another risk is exposure to chemicals like benzene, which is found in tobacco smoke. Some people don’t have symptoms with MDS, but others do, including: Bruising or bleeding Infection Fever Shortness of breath Weakness and fatigue Weight loss Oncologists (cancer doctors) and hematologists (blood doctors) treat MDS with chemotherapy, hematopoietic growth factors,\xa0and stem cell or bone marrow transplants .', ""Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia Autoimmune hemolytic anemia happens when your body's immune system attacks and destroys red blood cells faster than it can make new ones. If you have an autoimmune disease like lupus , you’re also more likely to get this type of anemia. Medicines such as methyldopa ( Aldomet ), penicillin , and quinine ( Qualaquin ) can also cause autoimmune hemolytic anemia."", 'Symptoms include fatigue, pale skin, fast heartbeat (tachycardia), trouble breathing, chills, backache, and yellow skin ( jaundice ). Treating the disease that caused the anemia can also stop your red blood cell damage. If you have an autoimmune disease, your doctor might treat you with steroid drugs to calm your immune system , which can help the anemia.', 'Congenital Dyserythropoietic Anemia (CDA) CDA is a group of inherited anemias that reduce the number of healthy red blood cells in the body. All CDAs are passed down through families. There are three types of CDA, types 1, 2, and 3. Type 2 is the most common and type 3 is the rarest. Symptoms include chronic anemia, fatigue, yellow skin and eyes (jaundice), pale skin, and missing fingers and toes at birth. Some people never need treatment. But depending on the severity of the disease, your doctor might recommend a blood transfusion, a stem cell transplant, or medicines to lower iron levels or interferon alfa-2A, a drug typically used for treating leukemia and melanoma .', ""Diamond-Blackfan Anemia If you have Diamond-Blackfan anemia, your bone marrow doesn't make enough red blood cells. Doctors think it is caused by changes to your genes. Symptoms of Diamond-Blackfan anemia include: Fast heartbeat (tachycardia) Fatigue Heart murmur Irritability Pale skin Short height Sleepiness Weak bones Treatments include everything from steroids that can help produce more red blood cells to red blood cell transfusions and bone marrow transplants."", ""Megaloblastic Anemia With this type of anemia, your bone marrow produces abnormally structured red blood cells that are too large and too young. Because they’re not mature or healthy, they can't carry oxygen throughout your body very well. Megaloblastic anemia is caused by too little vitamin B12 (cobalamin) or vitamin B9 (folate). Your body needs these vitamins to make red blood cells. Some people with megaloblastic anemia might not have symptoms for many years. But once symptoms do appear, they’re similar to other types of anemia, and include: Dizziness and fatigue Diarrhea , nausea Fast or irregular heartbeat (tachycardia) Muscle pain or weakness Pale skin Trouble breathing Doctors treat megaloblastic anemia with vitamin B9 and vitamin B12 supplements to replace what your body is missing. You'll also need treatment for any disease -- such as Crohn's -- that caused your body to lack these vitamins."", ""Fanconi Anemia Fanconi anemia makes your blood marrow produce too few blood cells. It's hereditary, meaning it’s passed down from one of your parents through a gene mutation. Symptoms and physical traits of Fanconi anemia include: Abnormal thumbs Easy bruising and bleeding Fatigue Frequent infections Heart , kidney , and bone problems Skin color changes Small body, head, and eyes If you have Fanconi anemia, you’re more likely to get a type of cancer called acute myeloid leukemia , or AML. Your odds of getting cancers of the head, neck, skin, GI tract, or genitals also go up. Treatment depends on several factors, including what stage it’s in and the severity of physical complications. Treatments include hormone therapy and growth factors to boost blood cell growth. If symptoms become severe, your doctor might recommend a bone marrow stem cell transplant. Oftentimes a bone marrow transplant can cure the problems altogether.""]"
11,What Is Basal Ganglia Calcification?,"[""Basal ganglia calcification is a very rare condition that happens when calcium builds up in your brain , usually in the basal ganglia, the part of your brain that helps control movement. Other parts of your brain can be affected as well. You're most likely to get basal ganglia calcification between the ages of 30 and 60, though it can happen at any time. Most people who develop it are in good health before they find out they have it. It should not be confused with familial idiopathic basal ganglia calcification or primary familial brain calcification, also called Fahr’s disease or Fahr’s syndrome. As the name suggests, this form of basal ganglia calcification is inherited, but it is also rare and more serious. It is a progressive disease with no known cure. Calcification can occur in many parts of the brain and is most commonly benign with no symptoms and not associated with Fahr's disease."", 'Causes Basal ganglia calcification sometimes happens when you age. Calcium build-up in your basal ganglia can also happen because of infection, problems with your parathyroid gland, and for other reasons.', 'Symptoms In most cases, you may have no symptoms at all. But if you do, there are usually two types: either movement-related or psychiatric. The exact symptoms depend on which part of your brain is affected. Movement symptoms: Clumsiness Walking unsteadily Talking more slowly than usual, or slurring your words Difficulty swallowing Involuntary movement of arms or legs Cramped muscles Stiff arms and legs (called spasticity) Tremors, muscle stiffness, lack of facial expression Psychiatric symptoms: Poor concentration Lapses in memory Mood changes Psychosis , or being out of touch with reality Dementia Other symptoms: Tiredness Migraines Seizures Vertigo , or dizziness Not being able to control when you urinate (called urinary incontinence ) Impotence', ""Diagnosis Your doctors usually start with symptoms and family history. A CT scan , which combines many X-rays to make detailed pictures of parts of your body, is the most common imaging test used to detect it. But if there is calcification, they can’t always tell if it's because of the condition or something else."", 'Imaging tests like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and X-rays might also show if there’s any calcium build-up in your brain. Your doctor might do special urine and blood tests to help rule out other problems. Testing of your genes is also possible if other things point to the illness.', 'Treatment There is no cure, but there is treatment for the symptoms. For example, if you are anxious or depressed, see your doctor. There are medicines to help with mood issues. If you have seizures, certain anti-epileptic medicines can help. Or if you have migraines, you can take medicine to both prevent and treat them. If you have this condition, it’s a good idea to see your doctor or specialist every year to see if it’s changed or advanced.']"
12,What Is Gastritis?,"['Gastritis is an inflammation , irritation, or erosion of the lining of the stomach . It can occur suddenly (acute) or gradually (chronic).', 'What Causes Gastritis? Gastritis can be caused by irritation due to excessive alcohol use, chronic vomiting , stress, or the use of certain medications such as aspirin or other anti-inflammatory drugs. It may also be caused by any of the following: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) : A bacteria that lives in the mucous lining of the stomach ; without treatment, the infection can lead to ulcers, and in some people, stomach cancer. Bile reflux: A backflow of bile into the stomach from the bile tract (that connects to the liver and gallbladder ) Infections caused by bacteria and viruses If gastritis is left untreated, it can lead to a severe loss of blood and may increase the risk of developing stomach cancer .', 'What Are the Symptoms of Gastritis? Symptoms of gastritis vary among individuals, and in many people there are no symptoms. However, the most common symptoms include: Nausea or recurrent upset stomach Abdominal bloating Abdominal pain Vomiting Indigestion Burning or gnawing feeling in the stomach between meals or at night Hiccups Loss of appetite Vomiting blood or coffee ground-like material Black, tarry stools', 'How Is Gastritis Diagnosed? To diagnose gastritis, your doctor will review your personal and family medical history, perform a thorough physical evaluation, and may recommend any of the following tests: Upper endoscopy . An endoscope , a thin tube containing a tiny camera, is inserted through your mouth and down into your stomach to look at the stomach lining. The doctor will check for inflammation and may perform a biopsy , a procedure in which a tiny sample of tissue is removed and then sent to a laboratory for analysis. Blood tests. The doctor may perform various blood tests, such as checking your red blood cell count to determine whether you have anemia , which means that you do not have enough red blood cells. They can also screen for H. pylori infection and pernicious anemia with blood tests. Fecal occult blood test (stool test) . This test checks for the presence of blood in your stool, a possible sign of gastritis.', 'What Is the Treatment for Gastritis? Treatment for gastritis usually involves: Taking antacids and other drugs (such as proton pump inhibitors or H-2 blockers) to reduce stomach acid Avoiding hot and spicy foods For gastritis caused by H. pylori infection, your doctor will prescribe a regimen of several antibiotics plus an acid blocking drug (used for heartburn) If the gastritis is caused by pernicious anemia , B12 vitamin shots will be given. Eliminating irritating foods from your diet such as lactose from dairy or gluten from wheat Once the underlying problem disappears, the gastritis usually does, too. You should talk to your doctor before stopping any medicine or starting any gastritis treatment on your own.', 'What Is the Prognosis for Gastritis? Most people with gastritis improve quickly once treatment has begun.']"
13,Heart Disease and Cardiomyopathy,"[""Cardiomyopathy , or heart muscle disease, is a type of progressive heart disease in which the heart is abnormally enlarged, thickened, and/or stiffened. As a result, the heart muscle's ability to pump blood is less efficient, often causing heart failure and the backup of blood into the lungs or rest of the body. The disease can also cause abnormal heart rhythms . There are three main types of cardiomyopathy: Dilated cardiomyopathy Ischemic cardiomyopathy Restrictive cardiomyopathy""]"
14,Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF),"['What Is Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF)? Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a serious lung disease. When you breathe in, oxygen moves through tiny air sacs in your lungs and into your bloodstream. From there, it travels to your organs. IPF causes scar tissue to grow inside your lungs and makes it hard to breathe. It gets worse over time. About 48,000 people get IPF each year in the United States. IPF scar tissue is thick, like the scars you get on your skin after a cut. It slows oxygen flow from your lungs to your blood, which can keep your body from working as it should. There’s no cure for IPF. For most people, symptoms don’t get better, but treatments can slow the damage to your lungs. Everyone’s outlook is different. Some people will get worse quickly, while others can live 10 years or more after diagnosis. There are treatments to help you breathe easier and manage your symptoms. You may be able to have a lung transplant.', ""Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Symptoms You can have idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis for a long time without noticing any symptoms. What does IPF feel like? Your lungs each contain about 300 million tiny air sacs called alveoli that fill with oxygen every time you breathe. In healthy lungs, the walls of these air sacs are very thin, so that oxygen and carbon dioxide can easily pass through them. When you have IPF, scar tissue forms on the air sac walls and in the spaces around them, making them thick and hard. This scarring makes it harder for air to pass in and out of the sacs. That's why you feel out of breath. If you have IPF, you may have rapid, shallow breathing or a dry, hacking cough that doesn't go away. When a doctor listens to your breath sounds through a stethoscope, they may hear a crackling noise in your lungs. After many years, the scarring in your lungs gets worse, and you might have: Chest pain or tightness Leg swelling Loss of appetite Other symptoms of IPF include: Feeling more tired than usual Joint and muscle aches Weight loss without trying Clubbing, when the tips of your fingers and toes get wider"", 'Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Causes Doctors don\'t know what exactly causes IPF. \xa0""Idiopathic"" means unexplained, and that\'s the term doctors use when they can\'t pinpoint a cause for your condition. Researchers think certain things you breathed in are linked to IPF, such as wood dust or asbestos. They believe that the scarring is caused by something in the body that attacks the lungs over and over, but they don\'t know what or why.', ""Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Risk Factors IPF can run in families. Some people with the disease have one or more relatives who have it. In these cases, it's known as familial IPF. Cigarette smoking is linked to IPF. So are some infections, such as the flu, Epstein-Barr virus (which causes mononucleosis), hepatitis, and herpes. These things may increase your risk of the disease, although they are not direct causes. People with IPF may also have gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), also known as acid reflux. Scientists don't know if one disease causes the other, but they suspect that people with GERD may breathe tiny drops of stomach acid into their lungs, which can cause damage over time."", 'Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Diagnosis IPF is hard to tell apart from other lung diseases because it shares many of the same signs. It may take time and a lot of doctor visits to get the right diagnosis. If you have trouble breathing that doesn’t get better, you’ll probably need to see a pulmonologist, a doctor who treats lung problems. The doctor will use a stethoscope to listen to your lungs. They might ask questions like: How long have you been feeling this way? Have you ever smoked or used drugs? Do you work with chemicals at your job or home? Which ones? Has anyone in your family been diagnosed with IPF? Do you have any other medical conditions? Have you ever been told you had the Epstein-Barr virus, influenza A, hepatitis C, or HIV?', 'Tests for IPF Your doctor may ask you to get tests that look for damage in your lungs. They can also help rule out other diseases.', ""Some you can take in your doctor's office without any special preparation, but for others you'll need to go to a lab or hospital. Chest scans. An X-ray lets your doctor see the structures inside your body. It may show shadows on your lungs that suggest scar tissue. You may also need an HRCT scan (high-resolution computed tomography). It's a sharper and more detailed type of X-ray that can spot signs of IPF at an earlier stage. Breathing test. Your doctor may use a device called a spirometer to measure how well your lungs are working. You take a deep breath in and then blow as hard as you can into a tube connected to the device. You'll wear a clip on your nose so you can only breathe in and out of your mouth. Pulse oximetry. Your doctor clips a small sensor to the tip of your finger or ear. It sends a painless beam of light through your skin to check the oxygen level in your arteries."", ""Blood test. It's used to check your oxygen and carbon dioxide levels. Your doctor takes blood from an artery on the inside of your wrist, arm, or groin. It may be slightly more painful than a regular blood test, which takes a sample from your veins. You may feel some discomfort. You'll need to sit calmly and keep pressure on the spot for a few minutes afterward to keep it from bleeding. Skin test. Tuberculosis causes symptoms that are like IPF, so you may need a test to rule out this disease. Your doctor uses a tiny needle to inject a substance under the top layer of skin on your arm. This will form a small bubble, like a blister. You'll need to see your doctor or lab technician 48 to 72 hours later to see if there's a reaction, which will look like a red, swollen bump. Exercise test. It measures how well your lungs push oxygen through your bloodstream while you're moving around. You may have to walk on a treadmill or pedal a stationary bike while hooked up to devices that measure your heart rate , blood pressure, and how much oxygen is in your blood."", 'Lung biopsy. The best way for your doctor to diagnose IPF is to take small samples of tissue from your lungs and check them under a microscope for signs of scarring or other disease. There are different ways to do it. Your doctor may put a needle through your chest, or they may put a long, thin tube through your mouth and down your throat. For some biopsies, you\'ll only need ""local anesthesia,"" which is medicine that numbs an area on your body. For others you\'ll need drugs that make you sleep while the procedure is done. You may be asked to stop eating for 8 hours before the biopsy. Make sure to find out if there are any other ways you need to prepare. Other lung tests. You might need to go to a hospital to get other exams done. For example, you could get a video-assisted thoracoscopy or bronchoscopy . Your doctor puts a tiny tube with a camera on the end through a cut in your chest or into your nose or mouth.', ""For a test called a bronchoalveolar lavage, your doctor injects salt water into your lungs to collect tissue samples. Another option is a thoracotomy . Your doctor removes small pieces of lung tissue through a cut between your ribs. You'll get medicine that puts you to sleep during these tests. Talk to your doctor about how you should prepare and what you should expect afterward."", 'Questions for Your Doctor You might want to ask: How do you know I have IPF? Do I need more tests? Do I need to see any other doctors? Which treatments might work best for me? How will they make me feel? Will anything help me breathe better right away? Are there any clinical trials that would be good for me? How often should I see you? Will I need a lung transplant? Will my children get IPF?', ""Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Treatment Treatments for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis won't cure the disease, but they can make it easier for you to breathe. Some may keep your lungs from getting worse quickly. Your doctor may suggest: Medicine. Two drugs, nintedanib (Ofev) and pirfenidone (Esbriet), are approved to treat IPF. They block a process in your lungs that leads to scarring. They may keep your IPF from getting worse and help you breathe better. \xa0You might take other medications to fight the inflammation that makes you feel sick or causes scarring. Your doctor may suggest corticosteroids like prednisone or drugs that slow down your immune system, like azathioprine (Imuran), cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan), and mycophenolate mofetil (CellCept). Another drug, N-acetylcysteine, or NAC (Mucomyst), is an oral or spray antioxidant widely used to treat IPF. Some studies have questioned how well it works. But a large review of results in 2019 concluded the drug was safe and may help, especially when used with other treatments. Oxygen therapy. It helps you feel less short of breath so you can stay active. You breathe oxygen through a mask or prongs that go in your nose. \xa0Whether you need to wear oxygen depends on how serious your condition is. Some people with IPF need it only when they sleep or exercise. Others need it 24 hours a day. Pulmonary rehabilitation. You work with a team of doctors, nurses, and therapists on ways to manage your symptoms. You might focus on exercise, healthy eating, relaxation, stress relief, and ways to save your energy. You may visit the hospital for a rehab program or do one at home."", ""Lung Transplants for IPF If your IPF scarring is severe, your doctor may suggest a lung transplant. Most people only think about doing this if other treatments aren't working."", ""Most people who get lung transplants are younger than 65. But if you're older and have no other serious medical problems, it may be an option for you. It's a major operation. There aren't many lungs available from donors, so you'll go on a list to receive one. While you wait, avoid smoking, eat a healthy diet, do your breathing exercises, and stay as active as possible."", ""Once you get word that a donor has been found, you may have to go to the hospital quickly for your surgery, so make sure your doctor can reach you at all times. You won't be awake during your surgery. Doctors put tubes into your mouth and windpipe that help you breathe while it's going on. During the operation, your surgeon removes your lung and the blood vessels that connect it to your heart. They then attach\xa0your new lung to these blood vessels. If you're getting two new lungs, you'll need a heart-lung bypass machine to pump oxygen into your blood during the surgery."", ""A single lung transplant takes 4-8 hours, and a double transplant takes 6-12 hours. After surgery, you'll recover in the hospital for up to 3 weeks. You'll need to cough to clear fluid from your lungs. You'll also do breathing exercises to learn to take slow, deep breaths. For 3 months after your surgery, your doctor will test your blood and lungs to make sure your body doesn't reject your new lung or you don't get any infections. You'll take medicines for the rest of your life to help prevent this from happening. It can take weeks or months to recover. If you're thinking about getting a transplant, you'll need a lot of emotional support. Ask your doctor about support groups that have people facing the same concerns as you. Also find out about educational workshops that can explain what to expect before and after surgery."", ""Living With Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a serious disease. It will have a big effect on your life and your loved ones. To stay as healthy as possible, follow your treatment plan and see your doctor regularly to make sure your treatment is working. Other things you can do to feel better include: Eat healthy. A well-rounded diet of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, low-fat or fat-free dairy, and lean protein is good for your body in general. Eating smaller meals more often will also give your lungs more room to breathe. Exercise. Take a daily walk or bike ride. It can strengthen your lungs and reduce stress. If it’s hard to breathe when you’re active, ask your doctor about using oxygen during your workouts. Quit smoking. Cigarettes and other tobacco products damage your lungs and make breathing problems worse. Your doctor can suggest programs to help you quit. Get all your vaccines and boosters. Vaccines can protect you from infections like COVID-19, the flu, whooping cough, or pneumonia, which can harm your lungs. You need a flu shot every year. You’ll need two vaccines to help protect against a serious type of pneumonia. You'll also need to stay up to date with COVID-19 boosters. Ask your doctor about when you should get these vaccines. Try to stay away from people who have colds. Find ways to relax. Low-key things that you enjoy are great ways to fight stress. Try reading, drawing, or meditating."", ""IPF life expectancy. How long you'll live with IPF depends on many things, including how old you were when you got your diagnosis, what stage your IPF is in, and how it's treated. Doctors don't know the average life expectancy. You may see online sources that say you'll live 3 to 5 years after diagnosis, but those numbers are outdated and don't take into treatment options you have now. It can be hard to manage an illness like IPF. Remember that it’s OK to ask a doctor, counselor, friend, or family member for help with any stress, sadness, or anger you may feel. Support groups are good places to talk to other people who are living with IPF or a similar condition. They can give you and your family advice and understanding."", 'What to Expect The scar tissue in your lungs makes it hard for your body to get oxygen, which puts a strain on your other organs. IPF can raise your odds of getting other conditions, including: High blood pressure in the lungs, called pulmonary hypertension Heart attack Stroke Blood clots in your lungs Lung cancer Lung infections', 'Ask your doctor what you can do to lower your chances of having these problems. There may be treatments that can help with these conditions, too. Everyone with IPF is different. For some, the disease gets worse quickly. For others, it can be a slow process in which their lungs stay the same for a long time. Talk to your doctor about your condition and what you can do to manage it. Average survival is 3 to 5 years, but some people live much longer. A lung transplant can also change your life expectancy.

15,IgA Nephropathy,"['IgA nephropathy is a kidney disorder caused by immune complexes and the protein immunoglobulin A (IgA) inside the glomeruli (filters) within the kidney . IgA nephropathy affects how blood is filtered in the small blood vessels of the kidneys. It occurs when these complexes damage the filtering unit (glomerulus) inside the kidneys. These glomeruli (the singular form is glomerulus), normally filter wastes and excess water from the blood and send them to the bladder as urine. The deposits of the IgA protein complex cause inflammation and damage that prevents this filtering process, leading to blood and protein in the urine, swelling in the hands and feet, high blood pressure, and progressive kidney disease . This chronic kidney disease may progress over a period of 10 to 20 years. If this disorder leads to end-stage renal disease, the patient must go on dialysis or receive a kidney transplant. Risk factors such as high blood pressure or smoking contribute to disease progression, through injury to the blood vessels within the kidneys.', ""The IgA protein is a normal part of the body's immune system. We do not know exactly what triggers the immune system to cause \xa0IgA deposits and other immune protein complexes in the glomeruli. But, since IgA nephropathy may run in families, genetic and environmental factors probably contribute to developing the disease. Kidney disease usually cannot be cured. Once the tiny filtering units are damaged, they cannot be repaired. Treatment that focuses on slowing the progression of the disease and preventing complications is critical. One complication is high blood pressure, which further damages glomeruli. Some patients may benefit from limiting protein in their diet to reduce the buildup of waste in the blood. Other lifestyle changes should include managing high blood pressure. Having excess weight or obesity may contribute to the loss of protein and kidney damage. Losing excess weight may help reduce proteinuria in IgAN. Smoking cessation should also be advised. Medications are available to help reduce damage to the kidney and disease progression. These include steroids and other immunosuppressant or biologic drugs."", 'For More Information American Kidney Fund 6110 Executive Boulevard Rockville, MD 20852 800-638-8299 IgA Nephropathy Support Network 964 Brown Avenue Huntington Valley, PA 19006 215-663-0536 National Heart , Lung , and Blood Institute Information Center P.O.

16,Vaccination Schedule,"['What Is a Vaccination Schedule? A vaccination schedule is a plan with recommendations for which vaccines your children should get and when they should get them. Vaccines are one of the most important ways to prevent children from getting some dangerous diseases. By exposing you to a germ in a controlled way, vaccines teach your body to recognize and fight it. Government vaccine recommendations are just that -- recommendations. You aren’t forced to get them. But state laws require your kids to have certain vaccines before they can go to daycare, school, or college, with some exceptions. Vaccines protect not just your child, but everyone they come in contact with. The more people who get vaccinated, the harder it is for a disease to spread. Before they’re approved for use and added to the schedule, vaccines go through years of testing to make sure they work and that they’re safe. The government keeps track of any reports of side effects to make sure no problems come up.', ""Types of Vaccines These are the vaccines recommended for children, and the diseases they protect against: Hepatitis B vaccine guards against hepatitis B virus, which damages the liver . Your child may have already received the first vaccine in the series in the hospital. The second dose comes at 1 or 2 months, and the third between 6 and 18 months. Getting vaccinated for rotavirus protects against the most common cause of diarrhea , vomiting , and dehydration in babies. It’s recommended at 2 and 4 months. Diphtheria, tetanus , pertussis (DTaP) is a combo vaccine that protects against three very serious diseases. Diphtheria swells up the throat, tetanus painfully tightens the muscles, and pertussis ( whooping cough ) makes it hard for kids to breathe. It’s a five-dose series that comes at 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, between 15 and 18 months, and between 4 and 6 years. Kids get a booster shot with a different formulation (Tdap) at age 11 or 12, and then every 10 years as an adult. Hib vaccine protects against Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), a type of bacteria that causes an infection in the brain and spinal cord that can damage a baby's brain and hearing. Babies need four doses, at 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, and between 12 and 15 months. Pneumococcal vaccine protects against Streptococcus pneumoniae , which causes meningitis , pneumonia, and some ear infections . It’s also a four-dose series, coming at 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, and 12 to 15 months. Polio is a disease that used to paralyze more than 25,000 people each year before the polio vaccine was invented. Now children are vaccinated against it at 2 months, 4 months, between 6 and 18 months, and between 4 and 6 years. MMR is another combo vaccine that protects against measles, mumps, and rubella. Measles gives you a rash and in rare cases, can lead to dangerous brain swelling. Mumps causes painful, swollen salivary glands. And rubella, also called German measles, can cause serious birth defects or miscarriage if a pregnant woman is infected. The MMR vaccine is recommended between 12 and 15 months and between 4 and 6 years. Chickenpox used to be an itchy childhood rite of passage. It too, can have serious complications such as pneumonia and encephalitis.\xa0 But the varicella vaccine has made it much less common. It comes between 12 and 15 months and between 4 and 6 years. Hepatitis A is a serious liver disease. The vaccine against it comes in two doses, given at least 6 months apart, starting at 12 months. Meningococcal conjugate vaccine guards against four different strains of bacteria that cause potentially deadly infections of the brain and bloodstream. Kids get it between ages 11 and 12, with a booster at age 16. A vaccine against an extra bacteria strain, meningococcal B, is available for older teens and young adults at high risk. The human papillomavirus vaccine (HPV) protects against a group of viruses that cause nearly all\xa0 cases of cervical cancer and most cancers of the vulva, penis, anus, rectum, and throat. It’s recommended for children aged 11 to 12 in two doses, 6 to 12 months apart. Teens older than 15 who haven’t gotten it need three doses. An influenza vaccine is recommended for everyone every year, from 6 months on. If you still have questions, talk to your baby's doctor about your concerns. Your doctor will provide you with literature about each vaccine that you can review and discuss with the doctor before your baby is vaccinated."", 'RECOMMENDED VACCINE VACCINE SCHEDULE PROTECTS AGAINST DTaP Dose 1: age 2 months Dose 2: age 4 months Dose 3: age 6 months Dose 4: Between ages 15 months and 18 months Dose 5: Between ages 4 years and 6 years Diphtheria , which can lead to heart muscle swelling, heart failure , coma , paralysis, and death Tetanus , which can lead to painful muscle spasms, trouble breathing , and death Pertussis , which can cause pneumonia, seizures, and death Influenza Every year , starting at age 6 months Extra dose recommended for children under age 9 the first year they receive this vaccine Influenza ( flu ), which can cause pneumonia HepA Dose 1: Between ages 12 months and 23 months Dose 2: 6 months to 18 months after first dose Catch-up series for those ages 2 years and older who have not already completed the HepA series.

17,What Is Lymphoma?,"['Lymphoma is cancer that begins in infection-fighting cells of the immune system , called lymphocytes. These cells are in the lymph nodes, spleen , thymus, bone marrow, and other parts of the body. When you have lymphoma, lymphocytes change and grow out of control. There are two main types of lymphoma: Non-Hodgkin: Most people with lymphoma have this type. Hodgkin Non-Hodgkin and Hodgkin lymphoma involve\xa0different types of lymphocyte cells. Every type of lymphoma grows at a different rate and responds differently to treatment. Lymphoma is very treatable, and the outlook can vary depending on the type of lymphoma and its stage. Your doctor can help you find the right treatment for your type and stage of the illness. Lymphoma is different from leukemia . Each of these cancers starts in a different type of cell. Lymphoma starts in infection-fighting lymphocytes. Leukemia starts in blood-forming cells inside bone marrow. Lymphoma is also not the same as lymphedema , which is a collection of fluid that forms in body tissues when there is damage or blockage to the lymph system.', ""Causes Scientists don't know what causes lymphoma in most cases. You might be more at risk if you: Are in your 60s or older for non-Hodgkin lymphoma Are between 15 and 40 or older than 55 for Hodgkin lymphoma Are male, although certain subtypes may be more common in females Have a weak immune system from HIV/AIDS, an organ transplant , or because you were born with an immune disease Have an immune system disease such as rheumatoid arthritis, Sjögren's syndrome, lupus, or celiac disease Have been infected with a virus such as Epstein-Barr, hepatitis C, or human T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (HTLV-1) Have a close relative who had lymphoma Were exposed to benzene or chemicals that kill bugs and weeds Were treated for Hodgkin or non-Hodgkin lymphoma in the past Were treated for cancer with radiation"", 'Symptoms Warning signs of lymphoma include: Swollen glands (lymph nodes), often in the neck, armpit, or groin that are painless Cough Shortness of breath Fever Night sweats Fatigue Weight loss Itching Many of these symptoms can also be warning signs of other illnesses. See your doctor to find out for sure if you have lymphoma.', ""Getting a Diagnosis Before you have any tests, your doctor will want to know: How have you been feeling? When did you first notice changes? Do you have pain? Where? How is your appetite? Have you lost any weight? Do you feel tired or weak? What are your current medical problems and treatments? What is your past medical history including conditions and treatments? What is your family medical history? Your doctor will do a physical exam, including a check for swollen lymph nodes. This symptom doesn't mean you have cancer. Most of the time, an infection -- unrelated to cancer -- causes swollen lymph nodes. You might get a lymph node biopsy to check for cancer cells. For this test, a doctor will remove all or part of a lymph node, or use a needle to take a small amount of tissue from the affected node. You might also have one of these tests to help diagnose, stage, or manage lymphoma: Bone marrow aspiration or biopsy. Your doctor uses a needle to remove fluid or tissue from your bone marrow -- the spongy part inside bone where blood cells are made -- to look for lymphoma cells. Chest X-ray. It will be done using low doses of radiation radiation to make images of the inside of your chest. MRI . A technician will use powerful magnets and radio waves to make pictures of organs and structures inside your body. PET scan . This imaging test uses a radioactive substance to look for cancer cells in your body. Molecular test. This test is used to find changes to genes, proteins, and other substances in cancer cells to help your doctor figure out which type of lymphoma you have. Blood tests. These check\xa0the number of certain cells, levels of other substances, or evidence of infection in your blood."", 'Questions for Your Doctor What type of lymphoma do I have?

Are there any I should avoid?', ""Treatment The treatment you get depends on what type of lymphoma you have and its stage. The main treatments for non-Hodgkin lymphoma are: Chemotherapy , which uses drugs to kill cancer cells Radiation therapy, which uses high-energy rays to destroy cancer cells Immunotherapy,\xa0which uses your body's immune system to attack cancer cells Targeted therapy\xa0that targets aspects of lymphoma cells to curb their growth The main treatments for Hodgkin lymphoma are: Chemotherapy Radiation therapy Immunotherapy If these treatments don't work, you might have a stem cell transplant. First you'll get very high doses of chemotherapy. This treatment kills cancer cells, but it also destroys stem cells in your bone marrow that make new blood cells. After chemotherapy, you will get a transplant of stem cells to replace the ones that were destroyed. Two types of stem cell transplants can be done: An autologous transplant uses your own stem cells. An allogeneic transplant uses stem cells taken from a donor."", ""Taking Care of Yourself Lymphoma treatment can cause side effects. Talk to your medical team about ways to relieve any symptoms you have. Also ask your doctor about changes to your diet and exercise that can help you feel better during your treatment. Ask a dietitian for help if you're not sure what types of food to eat. Exercises like walking or swimming can relieve fatigue and help you feel better during treatments like chemotherapy and radiation. You might also try alternative therapies like relaxation, biofeedback , or guided imagery to help relieve pain."", 'What to Expect Treatments have improved a lot, and many people do very well after treatment.

18,Ataxia: What Are the Types?,"['', 'Ataxia is a movement disorder caused by problems in the brain . When you have ataxia, you have trouble moving parts of your body the way you want. Or the muscles in your arms and legs might move when you don’t want them to. The word ataxia actually means “without coordination.” Ataxia isn’t a disorder or a disease itself -- it’s a sign of other underlying disorders or diseases. Doctors have discovered anywhere from 50 to 100 different ataxias. They are grouped into categories based on what causes them, or based on which part of the body they affect.', 'Types of Ataxia by Affected Area Ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) is rare genetic disease that affects the nervous system, the immune system, and many other parts of the body. Also known as Louis-Bar syndrome, dilated blood vessels and poor coordination are typical hallmarks of the condition. Small clusters of enlarged blood vessels called telangiectases can occur in the eyes and on the surface of the skin. People with A-T can easily develop lung infections and are at risk of developing cancers of the blood and immune system. Symptoms of A-T can appear in childhood and progress with age. Ataxia is caused by damage to different areas of the central nervous system. Doctors categorize it by the specific part of the brain most affected, including: Cerebellar ( brain ) Sensory (nerves) Vestibular ( ears )', 'Cerebellar Ataxia Your cerebellum is the part of your brain that’s in charge of balance and coordination. If part of your cerebellum starts to wear away, you can develop cerebellar ataxia. Sometimes it can also affect your spinal cord. It’s the most common form of ataxia. Symptoms of cerebellar ataxia include: Changes in your voice Dizziness Fatigue Headaches Muscle tremors Slurred speech Trouble walking Wide gait', 'Sensory Ataxia Sensory ataxia is the result of damage to nerves in your spinal cord or your peripheral nervous system. That is the part of your nervous system outside of the brain and spinal cord. When you have sensory ataxia, you have less sensation in your feet and legs from the nerve damage , so you have less feedback from your brain telling you where your body is in relation to the ground. It’s also called proprioceptive ataxia. Symptoms of sensory ataxia include: Difficulty touching your finger to your nose with closed eyes Inability to sense vibrations Trouble walking in dim light Walking with a “heavy step,” or stomping when you walk', 'Vestibular Ataxia Vestibular ataxia affects your vestibular system. This system is made up of your inner ear and ear canals, which contain fluid. They sense the movements of your head and help with your balance and spatial orientation. When the nerves in your vestibular system are affected, you can have the following problems: Blurred vision and other eye issues Nausea and vomiting Problems standing and sitting Staggering when you walk Trouble walking in a straight line Vertigo , or dizziness', ""Causes of Ataxia Around 150,000 people in the U.S. deal with some form of ataxia. There are different causes for it. Some are genetic, some are acquired, like injuries, and some have no known clear cause. Genetic. You can inherit a certain mutated, or changed, gene from one or both of your parents that causes ataxia. Or you may inherit a mutated gene that causes a disorder with ataxia as a symptom. Some of the specific types of genetic ataxia include: Ataxia telangiectasia Ataxia with oculomotor apraxia Dominant spastic ataxias Dominant spinocerebellar ataxias ( SCA ) Episodic ataxia Friedreich's ataxia Recessive spastic ataxias Wilson’s disease Acquired. Acquired ataxia occurs when you have damage to your spinal cord or nerves. The damage might be from an injury or an illness. Some of the causes of acquired ataxia could include: Brain tumors Brain hemorrhage (bleeding) Cerebral palsy Chickenpox Hydrocephalus , or too much fluid buildup in the brain Head trauma Multiple sclerosis Reactions to certain cancers Vitamin E or B12 deficiency"", 'You can also get ataxia if you have a reaction to certain medications , from alcohol or drug use, or from exposure to poison. Idiopathic. When you haven’t inherited a mutated gene or had an illness or injury that could have caused your ataxia, it’s called idiopathic ataxia. Your doctor will diagnose you with idiopathic ataxia if they can’t find a medical reason for your ataxia symptoms. The most common idiopathic ataxia is called multiple system atrophy , or MSA. Doctors haven’t pinned down possible causes for this group of ataxias. They may come from a combination of environmental factors and genetic causes.', 'Diagnosing Ataxia In order to diagnose your ataxia, your doctor will give you a physical exam . They’ll check your balance and coordination, hearing, vision , reflexes, and memory. You’ll also need a neurological exam, which might include an MRI or CT scan . These look at the structure of your brain for problems. For some cases, your doctor may recommend tests of your spinal fluid. To do this, they’ll insert a needle into your lower back and draw out the fluid to send it to a lab for testing. To rule out genetic forms of ataxia, you may need genetic testing . But, not all genetic forms of ataxia have tests to find them.', 'Treating Ataxia The best treatment for your ataxia symptoms depends on the type you have. There is no specific treatment for ataxia itself. If your ataxia is a symptom of another disorder, your doctor will treat that disorder. If it’s due to a cause that you can avoid, like lack of vitamins or exposure to poison, your doctor will help you address the problem causing the ataxia. In order to help you cope with your symptoms, your doctor may recommend: Counseling Physical or occupational therapy Speech therapy Support groups Your doctor can also help you find tools so you can move around easier, such as a cane or a walker. There are also utensils to help you eat and speak more easily. Learn more about qualifying for disability for\xa0ataxia .']"
19,"Prediabetes: Causes, Symptoms, and Treatment","['What Is Prediabetes? Prediabetes ,\xa0or borderline diabetes, is when your blood sugar level is higher than it should be but not high enough for your doctor to diagnose diabetes . People with type 2 diabetes almost always have prediabetes first. But it doesn’t usually cause symptoms. About 98 million people in the U.S. have prediabetes, but more than 80% don’t know that they have it. Prediabetes treatment can prevent more serious health problems, including type 2 diabetes and problems with your heart , blood vessels, eyes , and kidneys . Your doctor might also call this condition: Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) Impaired fasting glucose (IFG) Impaired glucose regulation (IGR) Non-diabetic hyperglycemia', ""Prediabetes Symptoms Most people don't have any signs of prediabetes. But you might notice that: You're a lot thirstier than usual. You pee a lot. Your vision is blurry. You’re a lot more tired than usual. You have areas of darker skin in your armpit or on your neck. You have small skin growths in the same areas."", 'Prediabetes symptoms in women Some early diabetes symptoms that could affect women (and those assigned female at birth) in particular are: Yeast and urinary tract infections Longer and heavier periods Reduced interest in sex Vaginal dryness that can make sex uncomfortable Trouble getting pregnant', ""Prediabetes Causes You get prediabetes because you have insulin resistance. That's when your body makes insulin (a hormone that helps regulate the levels of sugar in your bloodstream) but doesn't use it correctly. This causes your blood sugar levels to be higher than they should be. Insulin resistance causes Doctors aren't sure exactly why people develop insulin resistance. But things that can contribute to it include: Your genes Excess body fat Long-term stress Sleep loss Lack of exercise A diet heavy in processed foods Some hormonal health conditions, such as Cushing's syndrome and hypothyroidism Some medications, such as steroid drugs used over a long period"", 'Prediabetes Risk Factors Prediabetes risk factors You’re more likely to get prediabetes if you: Are over 45 Have a waist size larger than 40 inches if you’re a man (or were assigned as male at birth) and 35 inches if you’re a woman (or were assigned female at birth) Eat a lot of red and processed meat Drink sugary beverages Don’t eat enough fruit, veggies, nuts, whole grains , or olive oil Are Black, Native American, Latino, or Pacific Islander Have excess weight or obesity , especially if you tend to carry fat around your middle ( belly fat ) Have high cholesterol , high triglycerides , low HDL or ""good"" cholesterol , and high LDL or ""bad"" cholesterol Don\'t exercise regularly Had gestational diabetes or gave birth to a baby who weighed more than 9 pounds Have polycystic ovary syndrome, a common condition that causes irregular periods and other symptoms Have a sleep problem, such as sleep apnea Work that involves changing shifts or night shifts', ""Get tested for prediabetes if those things apply to you and if you: Have had an unusual blood sugar reading. Have heart disease . Show signs of insulin resistance, which means your body makes insulin but doesn't respond to it the way it should. These include darkened areas of skin, trouble concentrating, and more fatigue or hunger than usual. Why race and ethnicity matter in prediabetes As with diabetes, prediabetes is more common in people of certain ethnic and racial groups. Native Americans and Alaska Natives have the highest rates of diabetes among populations in the U.S. An estimated 75,000 people in the Navajo Area alone are thought to have prediabetes. According to the CDC, prediabetes affects about: 38.6% of non-Hispanic Black adults 36.8% of Asian adults 35.7% of non-Hispanic white adults 34.6% of Hispanic adults (though they're more likely to have been diagnosed with diabetes than Asian or white adults) There are many reasons for the disparities, including family health history and differences in access to health care, healthy foods, and safe places to exercise."", 'Prediabetes and gender The CDC says prediabetes affects men at a slightly higher rate (41%) than women (32%). Some early studies indicated that gender-affirming hormone therapy might worsen insulin resistance and increase the risk of diabetes in transgender women. But follow-up studies showed conflicting results, so more research is needed into this.', ""Prediabetes Tests and Diagnosis Your doctor will do at least one of these tests: Fasting plasma glucose test You won’t eat for 8 hours, and then a technician will take your blood to test the sugar levels. The results indicate: Normal range if your blood sugar is less than 100 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) Prediabetes range if your blood sugar is 100-125 mg/dL Diabetes range if your blood sugar is 126 mg/dL or higher Oral glucose tolerance test First, you'll have a fasting plasma glucose test. Then, you'll drink something sugary. After 2 hours, a technician will take more blood for testing. The results indicate: Normal range if your blood sugar is less than 140 mg/dL after the second test Prediabetes range if your blood sugar is 140-199 mg/dL after the second test Diabetes range if your blood sugar is 200 mg/dL or higher after the second test"", 'Hemoglobin A1c test This blood test shows your average blood sugar levels for the past 2-3 months. Doctors give it to people who have diabetes to see if their blood sugar levels are under control. They can also use it to diagnose prediabetes or diabetes. The results indicate: Normal range if it’s 5.6% or less Prediabetes range if it’s 5.7%-6.4% Diabetes range if it’s 6.5% or above You may need to take the test again to confirm the results.', 'Children and Prediabetes Testing Doctors diagnose prediabetes based on the same blood sugar levels, no matter the person’s age. The American Diabetes Association says children aged 10 and older should be tested if they have extra weight or obesity along with: A family member with type 2 diabetes A mother who had gestational diabetes while pregnant with the child Native American, Black, Hispanic, Asian American, or Pacific Islander heritage Signs of insulin resistance or conditions linked to it, such as low birth weight, high blood pressure, or polycystic ovary syndrome If a child who has a high chance of getting prediabetes gets normal test results, the American Diabetes Association advises testing them again at least every 3 years.', ""Prediabetes Complications Without treatment, prediabetes can become type 2 diabetes. That can lead to other serious problems, including: Kidney disease Blindness High blood pressure Nerve problems (peripheral neuropathy) Loss of a limb (amputation) Even before it becomes diabetes, untreated prediabetes could cause long-term damage to your blood vessels, kidneys, and heart. It's been linked to so-called silent heart attacks, whose symptoms are so minor that you may not even notice them."", ""Prediabetes Treatment The main treatment for prediabetes is a healthy lifestyle that includes these steps: Eat a\xa0healthy diet .

Trade red meat and processed meats for nuts, whole grains, poultry, and fish . Use olive oil instead of lard or butter.', 'If making big diet changes seems tough, start with little changes such as: Eat smaller portions . Add one vegetable to your dinner. Roast or bake foods instead of deep-frying. Eat a meat-free meal each week. Some healthy eating plans that can lower your chances of diabetes include: Mediterranean Plant-based ( vegetarian or vegan ) Low-fat DASH (dietary approach to stop hypertension ) If you’re not sure how to plan your meals, ask your doctor. They can refer you to a registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN). That’s a professional who’s trained to help you find healthy ways to eat. Most importantly, they’ll want to come up with a plan you can stick to. Exercise for prediabetes When you exercise , your body uses the sugar in your blood to fuel your workout . Over time, regular physical activity can lower your overall glucose levels. You’ll also become more sensitive to the insulin in your body. That makes it easier for your muscles to tap into that glucose.', 'You should get at least 150 minutes per week of moderate exercise. Aim for 30 minutes a day, 5 days a week. You don’t have to do anything too intense. You can: Go for a brisk walk (at least 2.5 mph) Try water aerobics Take a dance class Bike (slower than 10 mph) You may want to add a couple of days of strength, or resistance, training. That’s when you use weight machines, free weights, your own body, or exercise bands to build muscle.', 'If you’re new to exercise, talk to your doctor about what’s safe for you. Prediabetes and weight loss Not everyone with prediabetes needs to lose weight . But if you’re overweight , shedding 5%-10% of your body weight can lower your chances of diabetes by more than half. You may wonder whether carrying extra weight or being obesity causes diabetes. That’s something experts are still trying to figure out.\xa0What they do know is that extra body fat , especially around your belly, sends out hormones that affect your appetite and cause inflammation . The cells that help you use insulin may get hurt in the process. Some experts think losing belly fat may help you get better control of your blood sugar.', 'Prediabetes and sleep Studies show sleep loss can make it harder to control your blood sugar and appetite. That may be why your chances of obesity and type 2 diabetes go up if you sleep less than 5-6 hours a night. Your chances are also higher if the quality of your sleep is bad. If you have ongoing sleep problems, skip your afternoon caffeine . You’ll also want to avoid alcohol close to bedtime. Both can disrupt your slumber. If that doesn’t help, talk to your doctor. They can help treat your insomnia . Quit smoking Studies show people who smoke have a higher chance of prediabetes than nonsmokers. High levels of nicotine make it harder for your body to use insulin. Cigarette smoking also damages your cells in a way that experts think leads to diabetes. It’s important to talk to your doctor about how to quit.', ""Prediabetes Prevention The same healthy lifestyle habits that treat prediabetes can help prevent it . Other things that can help: Don’t have more than one alcoholic drink a day. Get regular checkups so your doctor can keep tabs on your blood sugar. Take any blood sugar medications just as your doctor prescribes. Unfortunately, prediabetes isn't always preventable. Some people whose genes put them at high risk for the condition may develop it even if they follow a healthy lifestyle. That's one reason it's important to keep up with your health care appointments."", 'Takeaways When you have prediabetes, your blood sugar levels are higher than they should be but not high enough to be considered diabetes. People with prediabetes are at higher risk for type 2 diabetes and the other health problems that can come along with it. You may be able to reverse it by making healthy lifestyle changes and, in some cases, by taking medicine to control your blood sugar.', ""Prediabetes FAQs How often should I check my blood sugar for prediabetes? If you're healthy, your doctor will probably test your blood sugar about every 3 years. If you already have prediabetes, they'll probably do it at least once a year. Because prediabetes doesn't usually cause symptoms, regular checkups are important, especially if you have a family history of diabetes or other risk factors. Can prediabetes put my vision at risk? Research shows that it's possible for those with prediabetes to get diabetic retinopathy, a condition that can lead to serious eye damage and sometimes blindness. If you have prediabetes, your doctor may recommend eye exams to check for retinopathy. Tell your doctor if you notice any changes in your vision.""]"
20,What Is Impetigo?,"[""What Is Impetigo? Impetigo is a common bacterial skin infection that spreads easily. It causes itchy sores or blisters to form on exposed skin, commonly around the nose or mouth. Impetigo is seen most often in babies and young kids, but you can get it at any age. The condition happens more often in the summer. Antibiotic treatment can help get rid of it. If your child gets red sores, especially around the nose and mouth, they could have impetigo. It's a skin infection caused by a bacteria, and it spreads easily. It's most common in babies and young children, but adults can get it too. (Photo credit: Zay Nyi Nyi/Dreamstime)"", 'Types of Impetigo Impetigo looks different based on the type you get and the color of your skin. But there are three main types, including: Non-bullous impetigo. This is the most common type. It causes tiny blisters to form around the nose and mouth that itch but usually aren’t that painful. These blisters eventually break open and ooze pus and fluid, leaving behind crusty yellow or golden scabs on your skin. This dry crust becomes a mark on the skin that fades over time without leaving a scar. Fever and swollen glands can develop in more serious cases. Bullous impetigo. You’ll get large fluid-filled blisters with this kind. They appear from the neck to the waist, but can also show on the arms and legs. The blisters spread quickly and burst after several days, leaving a crust that goes away without scarring. The area around the blisters may cause pain and itchiness. High temperatures and swollen glands are more common with this type of impetigo. Ecthyma. If impetigo goes untreated, it can develop into this form. Ecthyma is more serious because it goes deeper into the skin. It causes sores that are painful and filled with liquid or pus that lead to ulcers. Crust and redness develop around the sore. With this form, scars can develop, because the sores are set in the skin. For all of the types of impetigo, you should avoid touching or scratching the affected areas. The infection can spread to other parts of your body or to other people.', 'Impetigo Symptoms You’re most likely to get an impetigo infection around your nose and mouth or somewhere else on your face, but impetigo sores can appear anywhere on your skin on the body. Children tend to get them on their face. Sometimes they show up in the middle of your body (between your belly and neck) or on your arms or legs.', 'Depending on your skin tone, impetigo may look different, but symptoms may include: Impetigo rash. The infected areas range from dime to quarter size. They start as tiny clusters of blisters that break open and reveal moist, red, raw skin that may look like other kinds of rashes at first. But after a few days, you’ll get a grainy, golden crust that gradually spreads at the edges. Impetigo diaper rash happens when babies or young kids get an infection in moist spots under or around their diaper area. An impetigo rash may look red on lighter skin tones. The sores may be harder to notice right away on brown or darker skin, but they might be purple or\xa0grayish in color. Impetigo blisters. Before you develop a crusty yellow or golden scab, you may get itchy sores that hurt and burst and leak fluid or pus for a few days. The blisters caused by bullous impetigo tend to be larger and stay longer than the kind from non-bullous impetigo.', ""Impetigo Causes The most common cause of impetigo is bacteria called Staphylococcus aureus . Another bacteria source is group A streptococcus. You get impetigo when your immune system doesn’t fight off an infection from certain bacteria. These bacteria lurk everywhere. The most common way for your child to get impetigo is when they have contact with someone who has the infection, such as from playing contact sports like wrestling. It's especially easy to pick it up if your kid has an open wound or a fresh scratch."", ""Impetigo Risk Factors In addition to being able to get impetigo from your skin's contact with bacteria, there are certain things that increase the chances you’ll get an infection, including: Younger age. It shows up most often in kids ages 2 to 5. Experts think that’s because a child’s immune system hasn’t fully developed yet. Living in a certain climate. Impetigo is more common when it’s warm and humid outside. Open wounds. Germs can get inside your skin easier when it’s already broken. Other skin problems. People\xa0who have skin problems , fungal infections, or other skin conditions – like scabies, atopic dermatitis, eczema , body lice , or insect bites , – may have a harder time guarding against impetigo. Crowded spaces. Germs spread easier in places where people are in close contact with one another, such as schools or day care centers. If you share clothes, bedding, towels, or other objects with someone with the infection, you can catch impetigo."", ""Health conditions or medical treatment that weaken your immune system can also raise your risk of impetigo, including: Cancer treatment (chemotherapy) Diabetes Liver damage HIV or AIDS infection Kidney problems Drug use through a vein in your arm Treatment with dialysis IV (intravenous) drug use If you’re already at a higher risk of impetigo, you may be more likely to get an infection if you don’t wash your hands, body, or face very often. Children are also at risk of re-infection, as they may scratch and open their scabbing. If impetigo goes untreated, there's a greater risk of complications."", 'Impetigo Complications Impetigo rarely causes serious or long-lasting health issues, but complications do happen. These problems are more likely to pop up if your impetigo is severe and goes untreated, but most impetigo complications clear up with antibiotics. Impetigo complications may include: Cellulitis. This is when the infection goes deeper into your skin. The area may get red, warm, swollen, or painful. You may also get other signs of infection, including fever, chills, or generally feeling unwell. Untreated cellulitis can be fatal.', ""Guttate psoriasis. This is a non-infectious skin condition that can show up after a bacterial infection. You may get red, scaly patches on your arms, chest, legs, or scalp. It may go away without treatment in a few weeks, but tell your doctor about it. Creams may help. Scarring. Impetigo blisters and rashes typically don't damage your skin permanently. Scars are more likely to develop from ecthyma or intense scratching, so try not to touch your sores even if they’re really itchy. Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. Rarely, impetigo can infect the tiny blood vessels in your kidneys. This can be fatal. Get medical help right away if you notice symptoms such as dark or bloody urine; swelling of your belly, face, eyes, feet, or ankles; or if you pee a lot less. Septicemia.

Lab tests usually aren't needed. Some bacteria are resistant to certain antibiotics. You’re more likely to need extra lab work if your infection doesn’t get better with the first treatment you try. The doctor may take a sample of liquid from one of the sores to see which antibiotic might work the best. If you get impetigo a lot, the doctor may swab the inside of your nose and send the sample to a lab. They’re checking to see if you have bacteria in your nostrils causing repeat infections."", 'Impetigo Treatment These infections usually aren’t serious and may go away on their own within a few weeks, but doctors usually recommend antibiotic treatment for impetigo. There’s no guaranteed way to get rid of impetigo overnight, but antibiotics can help your skin heal faster (usually within 7 to 10 days) and lessen the chances you’ll spread the bacteria to someone else. Antibiotics to treat impetigo include: Impetigo cream. If you have only\xa0a few sores, your doctor may suggest you put over-the-counter or prescription antibiotic ointment or cream directly on your skin. They’ll let you know exactly how to use this topical treatment and for how long. To use antibiotic cream or ointment for impetigo, here are some things your doctor might suggest: Wash the affected area with soap and water to clear away crusted skin. Apply the antibiotic cream three or four times a day for 5 to 7 days. Wash your hands before and after you touch your skin. Cover the infected area loosely with a bandage, if possible.', 'If your symptoms don’t start to improve within a few days, tell your doctor. They may need to switch you to a different kind of antibiotic or another type of medicine. Impetigo antibiotics by mouth. You may need to take antibiotic pills or liquid for 7 to 10 days if your impetigo is serious or covers a big area. Your doctor may switch you to oral antibiotics if skin cream or ointments don’t help. Use impetigo antibiotics for as many days as your doctor tells you to, even if your skin gets better before you run out of medicine. Your infection is more likely to come back if you stop treatment early.', 'When to See a Doctor Check in with your doctor or dermatologist if you suspect impetigo. They can take a look at your skin to figure out what’s going on and find the best way to treat your blisters and sores. Tell the doctor if you or your child gets a fever along with skin problems. And let them know if the infection gets worse or if impetigo is not healing with antibiotics within a week of starting treatment. If you keep getting impetigo rashes or bullous impetigo, your doctor may run some tests to see why your skin can’t fight off the bacteria.', 'Impetigo Prevention You may not be able to avoid exposure to the bacteria that cause impetigo, but you can lessen the chances of spreading the infection to other people or other parts of your body. How to stop impetigo from spreading. Talk to your doctor about how to care for your skin, and use antibiotics or other impetigo treatment exactly as prescribed. You should also: Clean your sores with soap and water. Wash your hands often. Keep the sores covered with a bandage until they heal, if possible. Wash or disinfect toys touched by someone with impetigo. Use hot water to wash sheets, towels, clothing, or bedding used by someone with impetigo. Follow up with your doctor if your sores don’t get better with treatment. Until your infection clears up or your doctor gives you the OK, here are some things to remember: Don’t touch or scratch your sores (or let other people touch your infected skin).

21,How to Take Care of Your Wound After Surgery,"[""When you're back home after your operation, make sure the cut made by your surgeon doesn't get infected. Get familiar with some simple rules for taking care of your healing wound."", ""When do I take off the bandage? Your doctor will give you exact instructions on when and how to change it. Most wounds don't need one after a few days, but if you keep the area covered, it may help protect the cut from injury and it may heal faster. If you do keep a bandage on, change it every day. Wash your hands well with soap and water before and after."", ""How do I keep my wound clean? You can clean the skin around the cut with a soft cloth or gauze pad. First, soak the cloth or gauze in soapy water or in a mixture of sterile water and salt. Then, gently wipe or dab the skin around the wound. Don't use skin cleansers, antibacterial soaps, alcohol, iodine, or peroxide. They can damage the skin in the wound and delay healing. Also, don't put on any lotion, cream, or herbal product unless you've checked with your doctor first. Your doctor will tell you how to wash out your wound. They may say to fill a syringe with salt water or mild soapy water. This will help rinse away any pus that's draining out. Last, pat it dry with clean gauze or a clean cloth."", ""Do I need to keep the wound dry? Don't let it get wet for the first 24 hours after your surgery. So skip a bath or shower on the first day, though a sponge bath is usually OK. You might be able to shower by the second day, but it depends on the type of operation you had, so check with your doctor. Once you have the go-ahead to get your whole body wet, it's better to shower than to take a bath. That's because soaking your wound can soften it and may cause it to open up again. Ask if you need to put on a waterproof dressing. Don't put soap or any other bath products directly onto your wound while it's still healing. After you shower, gently pat the area dry with a clean towel."", ""Should I limit my activities? It's best to avoid movement that affects the area surrounding your wound. That way, you'll lower your risk of pulling the cut apart. Your doctor might tell you to stay away from lifting and some exercises and sports for about a month after surgery. If your cut opens up, call your doctor."", ""What should I do if my wound bleeds? Replace the bloody bandage with a new one. If you apply pressure directly to the cut for a few minutes, it will usually put an end to the bleeding. Call your doctor if it doesn't stop right away."", ""When will I get my stitches removed? If you have the dissolving type of stitches, you won't need to get them pulled out. They disappear on their own in 7 to 10 days. Your doctor can remove other kinds of stitches or staples in 5 to 21 days, depending on the surgery you had."", ""Should I keep my wound out of the sun? Sunburn can darken a healing scar and make it more noticeable. For the first 6 months after your operation, try to keep it out of sunlight.

22,What Causes Urinary Incontinence in Men?,"['If you have a hard time controlling when urine comes out of your body, it’s called urinary incontinence. It means your body has lost some control over your bladder . It can be frustrating and embarrassing, but figuring out what’s causing your pee to leak can help you find ways to treat and cope with the problem.', 'How Urine Leaks Normally, urine moves from your kidneys to your bladder through tubes called ureters. Your bladder stores your urine until a signal tells your brain that your bladder is full. Then urine leaves your body through a tube in your penis called the urethra. Urinary incontinence happens either because the signal to your brain gets scrambled or doesn’t happen, or because of a problem somewhere in your urinary tract. You may leak urine because: Your bladder squeezes too hard or at the wrong time The muscles around your urethra don’t work the way they should Your bladder doesn’t empty when it needs to, and gets too full Something is blocking your urethra Your urinary tract didn’t form correctly There are several reasons these things might be happening. There might be a medical condition behind it, or you may have had surgery recently that affects your bladder control.', 'Conditions That Cause Urinary Incontinence There are several health and lifestyle issues that can make you start to leak urine. They can include: Problems with your prostate . It’s common for prostate issues to cause urinary incontinence. Your prostate may be larger due to a non-cancerous condition called benign prostatic hyperplasia ( BPH ). Your prostate may also be bigger than usual because of cancer . An enlarged prostate can block your urethra. When your urethra is blocked, your bladder has to work harder to squeeze pee out. This makes its walls thicker and weaker. That makes it hard for your bladder to empty all the urine in it. You can also struggle with urinary incontinence with prostate cancer or after having certain treatments for it -- such as radiation treatment or surgery to remove your prostate. The surgery may cause problems with the nerves that control your bladder.', 'Certain diseases. Multiple sclerosis is a disease that can damage the nerves that tell the bladder when to empty and can also lead to bladder spasms . Some other conditions that can damage your nerves and keep your bladder from sending or receiving the signals it needs to work correctly are: Diabetes Stroke Alzheimer’s disease Parkinson’s disease', 'Surgery. Major bowel surgery, lower back surgery , and prostate surgery can all cause problems with your bladder. This is usually because some of the nerves in your urinary tract have been damaged during surgery. Old age. Just like other muscles in your body, your bladder loses some of its tone and strength as you age and this can cause leaks. Obesity or lack of exercise . When you don’t get enough activity, you may start carrying extra weight. When you add pounds to your body, your bladder feels more pressure. This can make you go to the bathroom more often, because you have a harder time holding your urine for a long time. Chronic coughing . If sickness, allergies, or other problems keep you in coughing fits, it can put stress on your bladder and pelvic floor muscles. If they’re weak, they may struggle to keep pee inside. Urinary tract infection . Bacteria can sometimes infect part of your urinary tract. The infection can irritate your bladder and cause incontinence .', 'Constipation . When your stool is hard or backed up, it can press on the nerves to your urinary system. This can cause leaks. Also good to know: drinking alcohol or taking certain medications like diuretics , antidepressants , sedatives, narcotics, or over-the-counter cold and diet medicines can make urinary incontinence worse. So, though they don’t cause the problem, they can worsen your symptoms.', 'When to See Your Doctor It’s time to get things checked out if: You have to go to the bathroom a lot more than usual, and often can’t hold in your urine until you get to the toilet You leak when you sneeze , cough, or even stand up You leak at random times, even if you didn’t cough or sneeze You feel like your bladder still has urine in it, even after you go Your stream of urine is weak You have to strain when you urinate It hurts to urinate You feel pressure in your lower abdomen']"
23,What Are Chronic Myeloproliferative Disorders?,"['Chronic myeloproliferative disorders (MPD) are rare blood cancers that have many different symptoms, yet no clear cause. Because of that, they can be tricky to diagnose. Years of care and treatment are common.', 'What Are They? Your blood contains red blood cells , white blood cells , and platelets. Each of these has a crucial job to do. Your red blood cells carry oxygen throughout your body. White blood cells protect your body from germs. Platelets control your bleeding. All of these parts of blood are made in your bone marrow, the soft tissue inside your bones. If you have MPD, your bone marrow makes too many deformed red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets. These pile up in your blood. There are six different types of MPD. The kind you have depends on which blood cells your body is making in excess. The six types are: Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML): Too many immature white blood cells are being made in your bone marrow. Polycythemia vera : You have an increased number of red blood cells. Often, there’s an excess of platelets and white blood cells, too. People with this have too many immature white and red blood cells. The web of fibers inside the bone marrow becomes thick, like scar tissue. This causes fewer and fewer red blood cells to be made. Primary myelofibrosis (chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis): People with this have too many immature white and red blood cells. The web of fibers inside the bone marrow becomes thick, like scar tissue. This causes fewer and fewer red blood cells to be made. Essential thrombocythemia: If you have this kind of MPD, you have too many platelets. Chronic neutrophilic leukemia: This disorder causes you to have a surplus of neutrophils -- a certain type of white blood cell -- in your bloodstream. Chronic eosinophilia leukemia: Eosinophils are another type of white blood cell. Your body produces them when you’ve been exposed to an allergen or parasite . People with this type of MPD have a high number of them in their blood. Any of these disorders can also lead to acute leukemia. This means that your bone marrow is making deformed white blood cells.', 'What Are the Causes? Doctors are still trying to answer this question. So far, what’s known is that if you have MPD, you have a gene mutation (change) on your bone marrow cells. This keeps your body from being able to make the right amount and kind of blood cells. You aren’t born with this mutation. It happens when you’re an adult. Some theories are that having a virus or being around toxic chemicals or radiation can cause this to happen. Only in very rare cases do MPDs run in families.', 'What Are the Symptoms? Signs that you have one of these disorders include: Fatigue Itchy skin Night sweats Bone pain Fever Weight loss Major complications of these disorders include: Excessive bleeding, which can happen with a minor cut, bruising or when capillaries break under the skin Blood clots (thrombosis) The disease changing into leukemia', 'How Are You Diagnosed? In the early stages of MPD, many people don’t have any symptoms. This makes it a challenge to diagnose. Any signs that do show up are often thought to be other, more common health problems. It is often found by chance when you have routine blood work.', 'You may need to see a doctor who specializes in MPD to be diagnosed. Blood tests will be ordered to get more details about your health. To confirm the diagnosis, a bone marrow biopsy is often done. To do this, a hollow needle will be put into your hip bone or breastbone. Then a sample of blood, bone marrow, or bone will be removed and sent to a lab. There, it can be checked under a microscope to look for cancer cells.', 'What’s the Treatment? These disorders are difficult to cure. Your doctor will typically focus on trying to get your blood cells back to normal levels and reducing the risk for major complications. The treatment depends on which myeloproliferative disorder you have. Some of the most common treatments are: Chemotherapy : Powerful medications are used to kill extra blood cells in your body. You may get this through an IV, or you could be given a pill that you take by mouth .', 'Radiation therapy: High-powered X-rays or other types of radiation can lower the number of blood cells you have and may relieve your symptoms. Phlebotomy : A unit of blood can be removed from you in order to decrease red blood cell counts. Gene therapy: New medications may be able to block or repair the mutated gene that causes MPD. Hormone therapy : Certain hormones can extend the life of your normal blood cells or push your bone marrow to make more. Hormone therapy may also lessen some side effects of MPD. Stem cell transplant: If you have a severe case of MPD, you might be able to have a stem cell transplant. During this procedure, healthy bone marrow, often from a bone marrow donor, is transferred to you. This is the only treatment that has the potential to cure MPD, but it’s not for everyone. Surgery: If your spleen is swollen, it may be removed during a surgery called a splenectomy . Clinical trials : These studies test new cancer treatments to see if they work as well or better than what’s already being used. In some cases, they may be your best choice. You may be among the first to try a new cancer medication or treatment, while helping with a crucial part of cancer research. Watchful waiting: If your MPD is very mild and you have no symptoms, your doctor may also suggest you wait to start any treatment. Some people are fine for several years with only a daily aspirin to prevent blood clots and regular doctor visits.']"
24,Gaucher Disease,"[""What Is Gaucher Disease? Gaucher disease is a rare condition passed down through your family. (Credit: iStock/Getty Images) Gaucher\xa0disease is a rare condition that can cause a variety of symptoms, from weakening of your bones to easy bruising. There's no cure. But depending on which type you have, treatment can help you manage some of the symptoms. Gaucher\xa0causes problems with the way your body gets rid of a certain kind of fat. With all types of this disease, an enzyme you need to break fat down doesn't work right. Fat builds up, especially in your liver, spleen, and bone marrow, and causes problems. There are three main types of Gaucher\xa0disease. Type 1, also known as non-neuronopathic Gaucher, is the most common. If you have it, your symptoms may be mild, moderate, or serious. Some people don't have any at all. There are many treatments for type 1. Type 2 and type 3 are more serious. Both affect the central nervous system. Babies with type 2 usually don't live past age 2. Type 3 also causes damage to the brain and spinal cord, but symptoms show up later in childhood. Your blood might not clot well, or you might get anemia . It can also cause bone mineral loss that leads to pain and easily broken bones."", ""It's passed along in families -- about 1 in 450 people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent (from Eastern and Central Europe) have the condition. It's the most common genetic disease that affects Jewish people. Whether you have the disease or are the parent of a child who has it, it's important to get support from family, friends, and perhaps a support group."", 'Causes of Gaucher Disease Gaucher\xa0disease isn\'t something you ""catch,"" like a cold or the flu. It\'s an inherited condition that\'s caused by a problem with the GBA gene and passed down through your family. You get the disease when both of your parents pass along a damaged GBA gene to you. You can pass a faulty gene on to your children even if you don\'t have Gaucher disease.', ""Symptoms of Gaucher Disease Symptoms vary a lot from person to person and depend in part on what type of Gaucher\xa0disease you've got."", ""Type 1. Symptoms of type 1 can appear at any time in your life, but they usually show up by the teen years. Sometimes the disease is so mild you won't notice any problems."", 'Some symptoms you might have are: Easy bruising, caused by low levels of blood platelets Nosebleeds Tiredness , caused by anemia (low levels of red blood cells) Enlarged spleen or liver, which makes your belly look swollen Bone problems like pain, breaks, or arthritis Lung disease Type 2. This very serious type affects infants, usually when they\'re 3 to 6 months old. Symptoms include: Slow back-and-forth eye movement Not gaining weight or growing as expected, called ""failure to thrive"" A high-pitched sound when breathing Seizures Brain damage , especially to the brain stem Enlarged liver or spleen Inability to swallow Pneumonia Throat muscle spasms Collodion skin, which looks like a thin, shiny coating Slow heart rate Infections Lung problems Bluish skin Perinatal lethal Gaucher\xa0disease . An infant with this form of type 2 usually lives only a few days. The symptoms include: Too much fluid in the baby\'s body before or soon after they\'re born Dry, scaly skin (called ichthyosis) and other skin problems Enlarged liver and spleen Serious brain and spinal cord problems Swollen stomach Unusual facial features', 'Type 3. Like type 2, it starts in childhood, but usually at a later age. The timing varies, but it usually shows up by the teen years. Type 3 brings the same blood and bone problems that type 1 does and also causes symptoms like: Trouble moving eyes side to side or up and down Lung disease that gets worse A slow breakdown in mental ability Problems controlling arms and legs Muscle spasms or shocks Your child may feel very ill and might need help to eat or get extra nutrition. As type 3 symptoms get worse, they may need help to dress, bathe, or get around the house. With the right treatments, people with type 3 can live into their 20s or 30s. There are technically three varieties of type 3 Gaucher: 3a, 3b, and 3c. But their symptoms often overlap. Type 3b may cause liver or spleen problems earlier. Type 3c, also called cardiovascular Gaucher disease, mostly affects your heart. Cardiovascular Gaucher\xa0disease (type 3c). This rare type causes symptoms like: Hardening of the heart valves and blood vessels Bone disease Enlarged spleen Eye problems', ""Gaucher Disease Diagnosis When you go to your doctor, they might ask: When did you notice your symptoms? What's your family's ethnic background? Have past generations of your family had similar medical problems? Did any children in your extended family pass away before age 2? If your doctor thinks it's Gaucher\xa0disease, they can confirm that with a blood or saliva test. They'll also do tests regularly to track the condition. You may have an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan to see if your liver or spleen is swollen. You might also get a bone density test to check for any loss of bone. When Gaucher\xa0disease runs in your family, blood or saliva tests can help you find out if you could pass the disease to your child."", ""Questions for Your Doctor If you just found out that you or your child has Gaucher\xa0disease, it's natural to have lots of questions and concerns about what to expect. Some things you may want to ask your doctor include: Will the symptoms change over time? If so, how? Which treatments are best? Do these treatments have side effects? What can I do about them? Is there a clinical trial that could help? Are there new symptoms I should watch for? How often do I need to see you? Are there other specialists I should see? Does having this disease mean I have a higher chance of getting other diseases? Should I add my name to a Gaucher\xa0disease registry? If I have more children, what are the chances they'll have Gaucher\xa0disease?"", 'Gaucher Disease Treatment How your doctor treats Gaucher\xa0disease depends on several things. Some treatments can only be used by adults. Others are designed for a specific type of Gaucher. If your symptoms are mild, you may not need any treatment.', ""Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is one choice for people who have type 1 and some with type 3. It helps ease anemia , build bone strength to ease pain and avoid breaks, and shrinks an enlarged spleen or liver. ERT doesn't work as well if you have type 3 disease that gives you brain or nervous system problems like seizures. That's because the drug can't get from your blood into your brain."", ""Enzyme replacement therapy medications include: Imiglucerase ( Cerezyme ) Taliglucerase alfa ( Elelyso ) Velaglucerase alfa ( VPRIV ) These are IV drugs. The medicine drips into your vein through a small tube. You'll get this treatment every 2 weeks at the doctor's office in a session that takes 1 to 2 hours. Other medications for type 1 are eliglustat ( Cerdelga ) and miglustat ( Zavesca ). You take them as pills. They curb the process in your body that leads to fat buildup when you have an enzyme shortage. Eliglustat is a newer drug you take twice a day. It may not work well for people whose bodies break down the drug too quickly. Miglustat is for adults with mild to moderate type 1 Gaucher who weren't helped by ERT. You swallow a capsule three times a day."", ""There's no treatment that can stop type 3 from damaging the brain, but researchers are always looking for new ways to fight the disease. Other treatments that can help symptoms are: Blood transfusions for anemia Medications to strengthen your bones, prevent the buildup of fat, and ease pain Joint replacement surgery to help you move better Surgery to remove a swollen spleen Stem cell transplant to reverse type 1 symptoms. This procedure is complicated and can cause both short-term and long-term problems, so it's rarely used. Pain treatments. Kids and adults with Gaucher may take drugs like acetaminophen or ibuprofen for mild pain or opioids for stronger pain. Antidepressants, anti-anxiety drugs, and muscle relaxers may also help with pain. Vitamin D, calcium, or other supplements may help ease Gaucher symptoms too. Your doctor may recommend them if they think you're not getting enough in your diet."", ""What to Expect Because the disease is different for each person, you'll need to work with your doctor to make sure you're getting the right care. Treatment can help you feel better and might help you live longer. You might consider joining a clinical trial . Scientists use them to study new methods to treat Gaucher\xa0disease. These trials test new drugs to see if they're safe and if they work. They often are a way for people to try new medicine that isn't available to everyone. Your doctor can tell you if one of these trials might be a good fit."", ""If your child has Gaucher, they might not grow as quickly as other kids. They might be late in reaching puberty. Depending on your symptoms, they may need to avoid contact sports or limit your movement. Some people have very bad pain and fatigue. It may take extra effort to be active. Little things can make a big difference, though. For example, wheelchairs or crutches can help when you're having trouble walking. Naps are also useful. If you have serious symptoms, you may need help every day and might not be able to live alone. Whether you have the disease or are caring for someone who has it, this is a tough condition to manage. When you get the support of others who face the same challenges, it can help you feel less isolated. Sharing information and tips can help make your daily life easier. Think about getting professional counseling. It might also help you manage your feelings and frustrations about living with Gaucher\xa0disease."", 'Getting Support You can get information on resources and support groups from the National Gaucher Foundation. The organization has a mentor program that lets you connect with others who have the disease to share experiences and ideas for living with your condition.']"
25,What Are the Symptoms and Causes of Infantile Spasms?,"[""The main symptoms of infantile spasms, also called West syndrome, are seizures and spasms. They don’t last very long -- only a few seconds. They happen in clusters. That means one follows right after another. Seizures can be mild or forceful. Your baby may have more than one type. In a mild seizure, they might look like they're nodding their head. A more violent seizure might make them stiffen up, fling their arms out, and bring their knees up toward their body. Or their arms and legs might go straight out as they throw their head back. Some seizures only affect one side of their body. They might cry right before or right after they have a seizure. Your baby may also seem to twitch or jerk a muscle. You might hear the doctor call this myoclonus. There are two types: Positive myoclonus: They twitch because their muscles suddenly tense up. Negative myoclonus: Their muscles suddenly relax. Myoclonus is involuntary. That means it isn’t something your baby does on purpose. They can’t control when it happens. It’s like the sudden twitch or jerk you sometimes feel as you fall asleep."", 'Symptoms You Can See West syndrome can affect your baby’s autonomic nervous system, the nerves in their body that control things that happen automatically, like their heartbeat and how wide their pupils are. During a seizure, your baby may: Turn pale or turn red Sweat Have big pupils Have watery eyes Breathe faster or slower Have a faster or slower heartbeat', 'Changes in Development As your baby grows, they reach milestones. They roll over, recognizes your voice, or puts things into their mouth. If your baby has West syndrome, it may take them longer to reach these points. Doctors call this delayed development. They might also forget how to do things they already learned how to do. For example, it may seem like your baby forgot how to sit up. If they were chugging along and meeting milestones, they may seem to stop or slow down. Your doctor may call this developmental regression.', ""Symptoms in the Brain Even though they're tiny, there’s a lot of electrical activity going in your baby’s brain. If it’s abnormal, they might have seizures. Your baby’s doctor may use electroencephalography -- EEG for short -- to measure their brain activity while they're awake and asleep. They’ll put sticky tabs called electrodes on their head, and a machine will record the data they pick up. Babies with infantile spasms often have an abnormal pattern of electrical activity in their brains. It's called hypsarrhythmia. The doctor might also want to do scans of their brain. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scans create pictures that will let them see if there are any parts of it that haven’t formed the right way. These pictures can also show lesions, or places where injury or infection may have damaged their brain."", 'Other Signs You Can’t See A condition called tuberous sclerosis is a common cause of West syndrome. It can cause noncancerous tumors that often look like colorless bumps on your baby’s skin. The doctor may use a special lamp to check for them. Blood and urine tests can help the doctor figure out if your baby has an infection that’s causing West syndrome. The doctor might also want to do a lumbar puncture (you’ll often hear this called a spinal tap) and take some of the fluid out of their spine to check for meningitis . They can also use that fluid to see if a genetic problem is to blame for their West syndrome.', 'What Causes West Syndrome? Anything that damages the brain can cause infantile spasms. Some of the causes happen before a baby is born, and some happen after birth. The most common cause is an inherited condition called tuberous sclerosis complex. It makes noncancerous tumors grow in different body parts, like your baby’s brain, skin, kidneys, or other organs. If your baby has them, you might notice colorless bumps on their skin.', 'Genetic conditions like Down syndrome can cause these spasms, too. Or it could come from a noninherited problem with your baby’s genes. Other causes of West syndrome include: Brain injury Problems with the way the brain formed Changes in brain structure Lack of oxygen to the brain Brain infections Lesions on the brain Bleeding inside the skull Inflammation in the brain (also called encephalitis ) Metabolism disorders Vitamin B deficiency Sometimes, doctors can’t find a cause for West syndrome. But there’s no evidence that it could be related to vaccinations or your baby’s sex.']"
26,Could Your Child Have Sleep Apnea?,"['When her son was in preschool, Cynthia Chin-Lee remembers teachers saying he would fall asleep during playtime. At age 10, \xa0Joshua was impossible to rouse in the mornings, saying, ""I need to sleep 10 more minutes. Leave me alone."" Joshua seemed tired, had bags under his eyes , and wasn\'t doing well in school, explains Chin-Lee, 53, a manager at a software company in Palo Alto, Calif. Chin-Lee\'s husband had a theory: Maybe their son had sleep apnea , a condition with which her husband had recently been diagnosed.', ""Risk Factors for Children's Sleep Apnea Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a sleep-related breathing disorder affecting more than 18 million adults and 2% to 3% of children of all ages, even newborns, according to the National Sleep Foundation. It seems to run in families, and kids who have enlarged tonsils and/or adenoids (lymph nodes in the throat behind the nose) have a higher risk of developing OSA. Other factors include being obese, having a small jaw or midface, or a larger-than-usual tongue , being exposed to tobacco smoke, and having less muscle tone (such as in children with Down syndrome, cerebral palsy , and/or neuromuscular disorders), explains Dennis Rosen, MD, associate medical director of the Center for Pediatric Sleep Disorders at Boston Children's Hospital."", 'Treating Children\'s Sleep Apnea Sleep apnea , derived from the Greek word for ""without breath,"" is a serious condition. Breathing temporarily pauses during sleep for more than 10 seconds in adults and longer than two breath cycles in children, and this can happen up to 70 times an hour. Oxygen levels in the blood plummet, and the body responds as if choking. Sometimes young children outgrow OSA as their throats get larger and airways stiffen, says Rosen. Those with large tonsils and adenoids may need surgery (adenotonsillectomy), which typically cures 80% to 90% of children, says Rosen. Joshua was diagnosed with OSA and needs additional treatment since tonsil surgery was unsuccessful. His parents are consulting another sleep specialist. ""I\'m relieved I have a diagnosis,"" says Chin-Lee.

27,What Are Motor Neuron Diseases?,"['When you take a walk, talk to a friend, or chew a piece of food, motor neurons are behind these movements. Just like other parts of your body, they can become damaged. You may have heard of ALS, commonly known as Lou Gehrig’s disease. It’s one kind of motor neuron disease, and there are several other lesser-known types.', ""What Are Motor Neurons? They are a type of nerve cell, and their job is to send messages around your body so you can move. You have two main kinds: Upper motor neurons are in your brain. They send messages from there to your spinal cord. Lower motor neurons are in your spinal cord. They transmit the messages sent from your brain to your muscles. As nerve cells die when you have a motor neuron disease, electrical messages can't get from your brain to your muscles. Over time, your muscles waste away. You may hear a doctor or nurse call this “atrophy.” When this happens, you lose control over movements. It gets harder to walk, talk, swallow, and breathe. Each kind of motor neuron disease affects different types of nerve cells or has a different cause. ALS is the most common of these diseases in adults. Here's a look at some of the types of motor neuron diseases."", 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) ALS affects both your upper and lower motor neurons. With ALS, you gradually lose control over the muscles that help you walk, talk, chew, swallow, and breathe. Over time, they weaken and waste away. You may also have stiffness and twitches in your muscles. Most of the time, ALS is what doctors call “sporadic.” This means anyone can get it. Only about 5% to 10% of cases in the United States run in families. ALS usually starts between the ages of 40 and 60.\xa0 Most people with the disease live for 3 to 5 years after their symptoms start, yet some people can live for 10 years or longer.', ""Primary Lateral Sclerosis (PLS) PLS is similar to ALS, but it affects only upper motor neurons. It causes weakness and stiffness in the arms and legs, a slowed walk, and poor coordination and balance. Speech also becomes slow and slurred. Like ALS, it usually starts in people 40 to 60 years old. The muscles get stiffer and weaker over time. But unlike ALS, people don't die from it."", 'Progressive Bulbar Palsy (PBP) This is a form of ALS. Many people with this condition will eventually develop ALS. PBP damages motor neurons in the brain stem, which is at the base of your brain. The stem has motor neurons that help you chew, swallow, and speak. With PBP, you might slur your words and have trouble chewing and swallowing. It also makes it hard to control emotions. You may laugh or cry without meaning to.', 'Pseudobulbar Palsy This is similar to progressive bulbar palsy. It affects motor neurons that control the ability to talk, chew, and swallow. Pseudobulbar palsy causes people to laugh or cry with no control.', 'Progressive Muscular Atrophy This form is much less common than ALS or PBP. It can be inherited or sporadic. Progressive muscular atrophy mainly affects your lower motor neurons. Weakness usually starts in your hands and then spreads to other parts of the body. Your muscles get weak and may cramp. This disease can turn into ALS.', ""Spinal Muscular Atrophy This is an inherited condition that affects lower motor neurons. A defect in a gene called SMN1 causes spinal muscular atrophy. This gene makes a protein that protects your motor neurons. Without it, they die. This causes weakness in the upper legs and arms, and in the trunk. SMA comes in different types that are based on when symptoms first appear: Type 1 (also called Werdnig-Hoffmann disease). It starts around age 6 months. Children with this type can't sit on their own or hold up their head. They have weak muscle tone, poor reflexes, and trouble swallowing and breathing. Type 2. It starts between 6 and 12 months. Kids with this form can sit, but they can't stand or walk alone. They may also have trouble breathing. Type 3 (also called Kugelberg-Welander disease). It starts between ages 2 and 17. It affects how a child can walk, run, stand up, and climb stairs. Kids with this type may also have a curved spine or shortened muscles or tendons around their joints. Type 4. It usually starts after age 30 . People with this type may have muscle weakness, shaking, twitching, or breathing problems. It mainly affects muscles in the upper arms and legs."", ""Kennedy's Disease It’s also inherited, and it affects only males. Females can be carriers but don’t get ill from it. A woman with the Kennedy’s disease gene has a 50% chance of passing it on to a son. Males with Kennedy's disease have shaking hands, muscle cramps and twitches, and weakness in their face, arms, and legs. They may have trouble swallowing and speaking. Men can have enlarged breasts and a low sperm count."", 'Living With a Motor Neuron Disease The outlook is different for each type of motor neuron disease. Some are milder and progress more slowly than others. Although there is no cure for motor neuron diseases, medicines and therapy can ease symptoms and improve your quality of life.']"
28,Understanding Rheumatic Fever,"[""What Is Rheumatic Fever? Rheumatic fever is a serious illness that can be life-threatening if left untreated. It happens when strep throat , caused by a bacteria called group A streptococcus, isn't treated properly. Symptoms usually start a few weeks after having strep throat and can include fever, muscle aches, swollen and painful joints, and sometimes a red rash. Sometimes, though, the infection may have been too mild for you to spot. The joints that are most commonly affected are the knees, ankles, elbows, and wrists. The pain can move from one joint to another. But the greatest danger from the disease is the damage it can do to the heart. More than half of the time, it damages the heart valves, making the heart work harder to pump blood. Over time, this damage can lead to a serious condition called rheumatic heart disease, which can eventually cause heart failure. Rheumatic fever can also cause a temporary nervous system disorder called Sydenham's chorea, previously known as St. Vitus' dance. This disorder causes rapid, jerky movements of the body, usually on one side. It can make it hard to focus or write for people with mild cases, while more severe cases can cause uncontrollable twitching in the arms, legs, or face, along with muscle weakness and emotional outbursts."", 'Thanks to antibiotics , rheumatic fever is now rare in developed countries. However, there has been a recent increase in cases in the U.S., especially among children in poor urban areas. The illness tends to happen more often in cool, damp weather during winter and early spring and is most common in the northern states of the U.S. Scarlet fever vs. rheumatic fever Scarlet fever is a highly contagious and typically mild bacterial disease that causes fever, sore throat, and a rash. The illness is connected to rheumatic fever in a couple of ways. Both stem from the group A streptococcus bacteria. One cause of rheumatic fever is untreated scarlet fever. While you can spread scarlet fever, rheumatic fever is not contagious.', ""Rheumatic Fever Causes Rheumatic fever happens when your body reacts to certain group A streptococcus bacteria. Instead of just fighting off the bacteria, your body's antibodies mistakenly attack your own tissues. This starts with the joints and can then affect the heart and nearby tissues. A very small number of people who have strep throat, less than 0.3%, end up getting rheumatic fever. Experts believe there are other factors involved too, like having a weak immune system. You can also get rheumatic fever if you don't treat a scarlet fever infection."", ""How often does strep throat cause rheumatic fever? About 0.3%-3% of people with a strep throat infection develop rheumatic fever, even without treatment. Is rheumatic fever contagious? No. Since it's an immune response and not an infection, you can't catch this illness from another person. But if you have the group A strep or scarlet fever infection, you can pass it on to others."", ""Rheumatic Fever Symptoms Swollen, tender, red, and extremely painful joints -- especially the knees, ankles, elbows, or wrists Fever A red, raised, lattice-like rash, usually on the chest, back, and abdomen Nodules, or small bumps, over the swollen joints Chest pain, fast heartbeat, or shortness of breath (caused by heart involvement) Jerky movements of arms, legs, or facial muscles that you can't control (called chorea) These symptoms can show up 1-5 weeks after a strep throat or scarlet fever infection where these infections were not treated properly. But sometimes, people with rheumatic fever do not recall having a sore throat."", 'Monitor a sore throat Pay attention to sore throats, especially in children. If your child has a severe sore throat without other cold symptoms , accompanied by a fever higher than 100.4\xa0F, or a milder sore throat that continues for more than 2 or 3 days, see a doctor. It may be strep throat, which should be treated with antibiotics .', 'When to Call Your Doctor Call your doctor about rheumatic fever if you have: Symptoms of rheumatic fever, especially a recent sore throat. A sore throat without other cold symptoms, plus a fever higher than 101 F and swollen glands in your neck. Sudden and unexplained joint pain after recovering from strep throat.', ""Rheumatic Fever Risk Factors Rheumatic fever can affect anyone who's had strep throat, scarlet fever, or impetigo. But some people are more likely to get the illness, including: Kids aged 5-15 years People in large groups such as schools, day-care centers, and military training facilities People who've had rheumatic fever in the past and get strep throat, scarlet fever, or impetigo again"", 'Rheumatic Fever Diagnosis To figure out if you have the streptococcus bacteria, your doctor will do a throat culture. This uncomfortable but safe procedure involves swabbing a sample of throat mucus. Your doctor will send it to the lab for analysis, which usually takes 24 hours. Some doctors use a rapid strep test that can give results in about 5 minutes, but it isn\'t as accurate as the culture. Your doctor will also give you a complete exam, which includes listening to your heart for any signs of trouble, such as a heart ""murmur"" (indicating potential valve issues). They will also look for other telltale symptoms, such as arthritis in more than one joint and small nodules that often appear on the joints, especially the elbows. Other tests to diagnose rheumatic fever include: A blood test that checks for antibodies related to a recent group A strep infection Electrocardiogram or EKG to find out how well your heart is working Echocardiography or echo, which shows your heart muscle in action', ""Rheumatic Fever Treatment Your doctor will prescribe standard treatments that can lower your chances of heart disease and other health issues related to rheumatic fever. You'll probably use these treatments for a long time. Alternative therapies can also help by working alongside regular treatments to ease symptoms and help stop the illness from coming back. You'll need plenty of rest, and your doctor may have you take penicillin or other antibiotics to kill the bacteria that caused the fever. To stop it from coming back, you may need to take antibiotics for a long time. And, if you have a fever, swelling, arthritic joint pain , or other symptoms, your doctor can prescribe aspirin or other medicines that ease swelling, such as ibuprofen or naproxen . They may also give you corticosteroids. If you have rheumatic heart disease, you'll need to take antibiotics at certain times, like before getting dental work or surgery, to stop your heart valve from swelling up again. In severe cases, surgery can fix the damage to your heart valves and stop heart failure from happening."", 'Rheumatic Fever Complications Weeks or even months after having rheumatic fever, you may still have joint and tissue swelling. This swelling could cause long-term health problems in some people. Another health issue, rheumatic heart disease, usually crops up years after your original illness, but heart valve damage can happen even when you still have symptoms. Other types of heart damage from rheumatic fever include: Valve stenosis, or a narrowing of the heart valve, which limits blood flow through the valve Valve regurgitation, which is when blood flows backward across a heart valve due to an improperly closing valve flap Heart muscle damage caused by swelling from rheumatic fever, which affects how well your heart pumps Irregular heartbeat, known as atrial fibrillation (AFib), which is caused by damage to the heart valves and other parts of your heart', ""Takeaways Rheumatic fever is a rare but serious bacterial illness that can result from untreated strep throat or scarlet fever. You'll usually get symptoms 2-4 weeks after a strep infection. Though rare in developed countries, the illness has resurfaced in the U.S. Other health problems from the disease, such as heart damage, can show up years after you were first sick. Treatments include antibiotics and medicine to lower swelling, while people with severe cases may need surgery to repair heart damage.""]"
29,Mononucleosis,"['What Is Mononucleosis? Mononucleosis is an infectious illness that’s usually caused by the Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ). It’s also called mono or “the kissing disease.” You can get the virus through kissing as well as things like sharing drinks or silverware. It’s contagious, but you’re less likely to catch mono than other common illnesses like a cold . Infectious mononucleosis. Swollen tonsils that appear red and with white lesions that may be oozing pus are a hallmark of infectious mononucleosis. It is considered highly contagious and is usually caused by the Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV). Mono spreads through saliva and therefore is sometimes called “kissing disease.” Mono isn’t usually a serious illness, but you can have complications that make it more dangerous. The symptoms of mono can range from mild to severe. You may not be able to take part in your normal daily activities for several weeks.', 'Mononucleosis Causes Many people are exposed to EBV as kids. But that doesn’t always mean you’ll get mono. You can carry the virus in your body for your entire life without ever having symptoms of mono. EBV is part of the herpes virus family. Most people are exposed to it at some point in their lives. In the U.S., about 85% to 90% of adults carry the virus by the time they’re 40.', 'How Do You Get Mono? EBV spreads through bodily fluids, usually saliva , which is why you can get it through kissing . You can also get it if you share food, drinks, or silverware with a person who has it or, rarely, if an infected person coughs or sneezes near you. If someone who has mono uses an object like a fork or spoon, the virus is probably still contagious as long as the object is still moist. EBV can be spread through blood and semen . It’s unusual, but you can get mono from medical procedures such as blood transfusions and organ transplants , or through sexual contact.', 'Mononucleosis Symptoms Mono can cause different symptoms in different people. If you get EBV, you may start to have symptoms of mono within about 4 to 7 weeks. Common symptoms include: Fever Fatigue Sore throat Swollen lymph nodes Sore muscles Loss of appetite Some people have no symptoms or ones that are so mild, they don’t notice them. Most people who get mono feel better in about 2 to 4 weeks. Sometimes, fatigue can last several weeks after that. In some cases, it can take 6 months or longer for the symptoms to go away.', 'Mononucleosis Diagnosis Your doctor can usually diagnose mono based on your symptoms. They might also check for swelling in your tonsils , lymph nodes , and liver or spleen . They can confirm a mono diagnosis with blood tests including: Complete blood count ( CBC ). Your doctor will look at your white blood cells, including whether any of them are unusual or whether you have more than usual. Antibody tests . Your doctor will look for proteins that your immune system creates in response to EBV.', 'Mononucleosis Complications Complications from mono can be serious. They might include: Swollen tonsils. They might narrow your airway, making it harder to swallow or breathe through your mouth . Enlarged spleen . If it becomes severe, your spleen can burst. This causes a sudden sharp pain on the left side of your upper belly. If you have pain like this, it’s an emergency. Get medical care right away. You may need surgery. Liver problems . You might have hepatitis or jaundice . Blood problems. Your body might destroy too many of your red blood cells ( hemolytic anemia ). Or your blood might not have enough platelets ( thrombocytopenia ). Heart problems. Your heart muscle might become inflamed ( myocarditis ), or you might have an uneven heartbeat. Nervous system problems. This can include seizures , brain inflammation ( encephalitis ), or inflammation of the tissues covering your brain ( meningitis ). You’re more likely to have serious complications from mono if your immune system is weakened because of an illness like HIV or AIDS , or because you take certain medications .', 'Mononucleosis Treatment No medications treat mono. Antibiotics and antivirals don’t work on EBV. Things that may help you feel better include: Lots of rest Lots of fluids Over-the-counter pain relievers, like acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, for fever and pain Corticosteroid medication for swelling in your throat', 'Mononucleosis Prevention There’s no vaccine to prevent mono. EBV can stay in your saliva for months after you’re infected, so even if you don’t have symptoms or feel sick, you may be able to spread it. To lower your chances of getting mono, wash your hands often and try not to share things like drinks, silverware, or toothbrushes with other people.']"
30,Inherited Lipodystrophy,"['What Is Inherited Lipodystrophy? Lipodystrophy is a problem with the way your body uses and stores fat. It\'s called ""inherited"" because you\'re born with it. It comes from the genes you got from one or both of your parents. It makes you lose the fat under your skin, so it can change the way you look. And it can also cause other changes in your body. Scientists have learned a great deal about how this disease works. You can\'t cure it, but with your doctor\'s help, the right treatment, a low-fat diet, and plenty of exercise, it\'s something you can live with. Because fat tissue makes the hormone leptin, people with inherited lipodystrophy often don\'t have enough of this chemical. Leptin tells your body you\'ve eaten enough and to make insulin. The condition can also make fat build up in places it shouldn\'t, like the blood, heart, kidneys, liver, and pancreas. This condition causes other problems, too, including diabetes, high cholesterol and triglycerides, and fatty liver disease. Inherited lipodystrophy is actually a group of related illnesses. The most common are: Congenital generalized lipodystrophy (CGL), also called Berardinelli-Seip syndrome Familial partial lipodystrophy (FPL)', ""Causes Researchers have found several genes that cause inherited lipodystrophy. That's why there are different subtypes. Sometimes, just one bad gene from one parent can cause it; sometimes, you must get a gene from each parent. It’s also possible to have a bad gene but not get the disease."", 'Symptoms The two main kinds of inherited lipodystrophy have several subtypes. Each of those has its own specific symptoms. Their severity varies, too. CGL . Babies look very muscular because they have almost no body fat. Most have a large belly button or a hernia, or bulging, around it. They grow fast and are very hungry. Their skin may be dark, thick, and velvety in places, especially at the neck, armpits, and where their legs meet the trunk of their body. Infants usually develop an enlarged liver. Young kids have problems controlling their blood sugar and triglyceride levels. Some children will have trouble thinking and learning.', 'Adults with CGL have large hands and feet and a strong, square jawbone because their hormone balance is off and they keep growing. They could have larger than usual sex organs (clitoris, or penis and testicles).', 'A woman might have irregular periods or no periods. They could have polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). They\'ll probably have extra hair on their upper lip and chin. FPL . The most common form shows up around puberty. Children lose body fat from their arms, legs, and trunk while they gain fat in their face, chin, and neck. They\'ll get dark, velvety skin in folds and creases. They could have insulin resistance and an enlarged liver, too. It\'s easier to recognize FPL in women, since men tend to look muscular even without the disease. About one-quarter of women get more body hair. They can also have problems with their periods and may get PCOS. These women are more likely to have serious complications including: Diabetes High triglyceride and low HDL (the ""good"" cholesterol) levels Heart disease', 'Getting a Diagnosis Your doctor might ask you these questions: What symptoms have you noticed? When did you first see them? Are changes in how your child looks only in certain areas, or all over? Have you had their blood sugar, cholesterol, and triglyceride levels checked? Have they had bad belly aches or oily poop? What other health problems do they have? Are their parents related by blood? Does anyone else in the family have problems with body fat?', ""Since lipodystrophy is passed on by genes, your family history is very important. After talking to you and doing a full exam, the doctor may want to do some tests to learn more about what type of lipodystrophy your child has. Blood tests check: Blood sugar Kidney health Fats Liver enzymes Uric acid Checking your child's blood for leptin won't diagnose lipodystrophy, but it can help your doctor decide how to treat it. Urine tests check for kidney problems. X-rays use radiation in low doses to make images of structures inside their body. These can show bone problems that some people with lipodystrophy have."", 'For a skin biopsy , the doctor will take a small piece of skin and check the cells under a microscope. Genetic testing may find the specific problem genes to pinpoint what type of lipodystrophy they have. Your doctor may also look for a pattern of fat loss with: Skinfold thickness measurements, checking how much skin they can pinch between their fingers at specific spots on the body A special X-ray that measures bone mineral density A special whole-body MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) that uses powerful magnets and radio waves to make pictures showing tissues with fat', 'Questions for Your Doctor What subtype of lipodystrophy is this? Do we need any more tests? How many people with this disease have you treated? What\'s the best way for us to manage this condition? What other symptoms should I watch for? How often should we see you? Do we need to see any other doctors? Is there anything I can do that will help my child look and feel ""normal""? Can we be part of a lipodystrophy research study? Is it important to let other family members know they have this disease?', ""Treatment Since you can't replace the missing body fat, your aim will be to avoid complications of the disease. A healthy lifestyle plays a big role. Everyone with lipodystrophy should eat a low-fat diet. But children still need enough calories and good nutrition so they grow properly. Exercise, especially if you have FPL, will help you stay healthy, too. Physical activity lowers blood sugar and can keep fat from building up where it shouldn’t."", ""People with CGL may be able to get shots of metreleptin (Myalept) to replace the missing leptin and help prevent other diseases. Statins and omega-3 fatty acids, found in some fish, can help control high cholesterol or triglycerides, too. If your child has diabetes, they'll need to take insulin or other drugs to control their blood sugar. Women shouldn't use birth control pills or hormone replacement therapy for menopause because they can make levels of fats worse."", ""Your doctor may prescribe a lotion or cream to lighten and soften dark skin patches. Over-the-counter bleaches and skin scrubs probably won't work and could irritate the skin. As your child with CGL gets older, they may be able to get plastic surgery for their face with skin grafts from their thighs, belly, or scalp. Doctors can also use implants and injections of fillers to help reshape facial features. People with FPL who have extra fat deposits can have liposuction to get rid of some areas, but fat may build up again. Talk to your doctor about what approach for their appearance makes sense and when."", 'Taking Care of Your Child Because this condition affects how someone looks, care and compassion are as important as medicine. Focus on keeping your child healthy and giving them a meaningful, rewarding life. Set the tone for others. Be positive and open-minded. People may not know how to react or what to say to keep from prying or offending or embarrassing you. When someone asks about them, be matter-of-fact about their condition. Do what you can to boost self-esteem. Try to focus your praise on achievements, rather than appearance. Encourage friendships. But kids will be kids, so prepare them for unkind looks and words. Help them practice how they can respond with role-play and humor. Think about getting professional counseling. Someone with training can help your child and your family sort out their feelings as they deal with the challenges of this disease.', ""What to Expect How long and how well someone with inherited lipodystrophy lives depends on how well they can manage the complications. Heart, blood vessel, liver, and kidney problems are common, and sometimes they're life-threatening. Diabetes is often hard to control. Some people have bone, immune system, or hormone-related troubles."", ""Women with CGL usually can't have children, but men can. Someone with FPL has a 50/50 chance of passing the faulty gene to their child. Work closely with your doctor to help prevent the most serious complications for your child's subtype. Researchers are studying this disease, and they may find more treatment options."", 'Getting Support Living with a condition like this can feel very isolating. It really helps to reach out. Lipodystrophy United has information about the disease as well as an online community for people with lipodystrophy and their families. You can also add your information to a free, confidential registry to help researchers find new treatments.']"
31,Insomnia,"['What Is Insomnia? Insomnia is a sleep disorder in which you have trouble falling and/or staying asleep. The condition can be short-term (acute) or can last a long time (chronic). It may also come and go. Acute insomnia lasts from 1 night to a few weeks. Insomnia is chronic when it happens at least 3 nights a week for 3 months or more.', ""Types of Insomnia There are two types of insomnia : primary and secondary. Primary insomnia: This means your sleep problems aren’t linked to any other health condition or problem. Secondary insomnia: This means you have trouble sleeping because of a health condition (like asthma , depression , arthritis , cancer , or heartburn ); pain ; medication ; or substance use (like alcohol ). You might also hear about: Sleep-onset insomnia: This means you have trouble getting to sleep. Sleep-maintenance insomnia: This happens when you have trouble staying asleep through the night or wake up too early. Mixed insomnia: With this type of insomnia, you have trouble both falling asleep and staying asleep through the night. Paradoxical insomnia: When you have paradoxical insomnia, you underestimate the time you're asleep. It feels like you sleep a lot less than you really do."", ""Insomnia Causes Primary causes of\xa0insomnia\xa0include: Stress related to big life events, like a job loss or change, the death of a loved one, divorce, or moving Things around you like noise, light, or temperature Changes to your sleep schedule like jet lag , a new shift at work, or bad habits you picked up when you had other sleep problems Your genes. Research has found that a tendency for insomnia may run in families. Secondary causes of\xa0insomnia\xa0include: Mental health issues like depression and anxiety Medications for colds , allergies , depression, high blood pressure , and asthma . Pain or discomfort at night Caffeine , tobacco , or alcohol use, as well as use of illicit drugs. Hyperthyroidism and other endocrine problems Other sleep disorders, like sleep apnea or restless legs syndrome Pregnancy Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia ADHD PMS and menopause Why can't you sleep?"", 'Insomnia Risk Factors Insomnia affects women more than men and older people more than younger ones. Young and middle-age African Americans also have a higher risk. Other risk factors include: Long-term illness Mental health issues Working night shifts or shifts that rotate', 'Insomnia Symptoms Symptoms of insomnia include: Sleepiness during the day Fatigue Grumpiness Problems with concentration or memory', 'Insomnia Diagnosis Your doctor will do a physical exam and ask about your medical history and sleep history. They might tell you to keep a sleep diary for a week or two, keeping track of your sleep patterns and how you feel during the day. They may talk to your bed partner about how much and how well you’re sleeping. You might also have special tests at a sleep center.', 'Insomnia Treatment Acute insomnia may not need treatment. If it’s hard for you to do everyday activities because you’re tired , your doctor may prescribe sleeping pills for a short time. Medicines that work quickly but briefly can help you avoid problems like drowsiness the next day. Don’t use over-the-counter sleeping pills for insomnia. They might have side effects, and they tend to work less well over time. For chronic insomnia, you’ll need treatment for the conditions or health problems that are keeping you awake. Your doctor might also suggest behavioral therapy . This can help you change the things you do that make insomnia worse and learn what you can do to promote sleep.', 'Insomnia Complications Our bodies and brains need sleep so they can repair themselves. It’s also crucial for learning and keeping memories. If insomnia is keeping you awake, you could have: A higher risk of health problems like high blood pressure, obesity , and depression A higher risk of falling, if you’re an older woman Trouble focusing Anxiety Grumpiness Slow reaction time that can lead to a car crash', ""Insomnia Prevention Good sleep habits, also called sleep hygiene, can help you beat insomnia. Here are some tips: Go to sleep at the same time each night, and get up at the same time each morning. Try not to take naps during the day, because they may make you less sleepy at night. Don’t use phones or e-books before bed. Their light can make it harder to fall asleep. Avoid caffeine , nicotine, and alcohol late in the day. Caffeine and nicotine are stimulants and can keep you from falling asleep. Alcohol can make you wake up in the middle of the night and hurt your sleep quality. Get regular exercise . Try not to work out close to bedtime, because it may make it hard to fall asleep. Experts suggest exercising at least 3 to 4 hours before bed. Don't eat a heavy meal late in the day. But a light snack before bedtime may help you sleep. Make your bedroom comfortable: dark, quiet, and not too warm or too cold. If light is a problem, use a sleeping mask. To cover up sounds, try earplugs, a fan, or a white noise machine. Follow a routine to relax before bed. Read a book, listen to music , or take a bath. Don’t use your bed for anything other than sleep and sex . If you can't fall asleep and aren’t drowsy, get up and do something calming, like reading until you feel sleepy. If you tend to lie awake and worry about things, make a to-do list before you go to bed. This may help you put your concerns aside for the night.""]"
32,Anemia,"[""What Is Anemia? Anemia is defined as a low number of red blood cells . In a routine blood test, anemia is reported as a low hemoglobin or hematocrit. Hemoglobin is the main protein in your red blood cells. It carries oxygen and delivers it throughout your body. If you have anemia, your hemoglobin level will be low, too. If it is low enough, your tissues or organs may not get enough oxygen. Symptoms of anemia – like fatigue or shortness of breath\xa0– happen because your organs aren't getting what they need to work the way they should. Anemia is the most common blood condition in the U.S. It affects almost 6% of the population. Women, young children, and people with long-term diseases are more likely to have anemia. Important things to remember are: Certain forms of anemia are passed down through your genes, and infants may have it from birth. Women are at risk of iron-deficiency anemia because of blood loss from their periods and higher blood supply demands during pregnancy . Older adults have a greater risk of anemia because\xa0they are more likely to have kidney disease or other chronic medical conditions."", 'How serious is anemia? There are many types of anemia. All have different causes and treatments. Some forms – like the mild anemia that happens during pregnancy – aren’t a major concern. But some types of anemia may reflect a serious medical condition. Can anemia be cured? Yes, anemia can be easily cured. It is usually a short-term issue that can be treated with a change in diet or by taking supplements. It is uncommon to need other interventions to treat anemia, but it is possible.', 'Anemia Symptoms The signs of anemia can be so mild\xa0that you might not even notice them. At a certain point, as your blood cells decrease, symptoms often develop. Depending on the cause of the anemia, symptoms may include: Dizziness, lightheadness, or feeling like you are about to pass out A fast or unusual heartbeat A headache Pain, including in your bones, chest, belly, and joints Problems with growth, for children and teens Shortness of breath Skin that’s pale or yellow Cold hands and feet Tiredness or weakness', 'Severe anemia symptoms If anemia gets worse, symptoms may include: Brittle nails Mouth ulcers Loss of sexual interest For women, increased menstrual bleeding An inflamed or sore tongue While at rest or with little activity, shortness of breath Getting lightheaded when you stand up Pale skin color Pica syndrome, or the desire to eat non-food things such as ice Blue color to the whites of the eyes Symptoms of dying from anemia Dying from anemia is very rare. Some genetic conditions that could contribute to this include sickle cell and some hemolytic anemias being passed down. After a major injury, severe bleeding can lead to short-term, life-threatening anemia. And cancers and other diseases may also be a potential cause of anemia. This demonstrates the difference between a normal red blood cell level and the red blood cell level of someone with anemia.  Photo credit: iStock / Getty Images', 'Anemia Types and Causes There are more than 400 types of anemia, and they’re divided into three groups: Anemia caused by blood loss Anemia caused by decreased or faulty red blood cell production Anemia caused by destruction of red blood cells', ""Anemia caused by blood loss You can lose red blood cells through bleeding. This can happen slowly over a long period of time, and you might not notice. Causes can include: Gastrointestinal conditions such as ulcers , hemorrhoids , gastritis ( inflammation of your stomach ), and cancer Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) such as aspirin or ibuprofen , which can cause ulcers and gastritis A woman’s period, especially if you have a heavy menstruation (or heavy period). This can be linked to fibroids. Post-trauma or post-surgery Blood loss at delivery and the immediate postpartum period Anemia caused by decreased or faulty red blood cell production With this type of anemia, your body may not create enough blood cells, or they may not work the way they should. This can happen because there’s something wrong with your red blood cells or because you don’t have enough minerals and vitamins for your red blood cells to form normally. Conditions linked to these causes of anemia include: Bone marrow and stem cell problems Iron-deficiency anemia, as the name suggests, is when the body doesn't produce enough iron. Your blood will lack healthy red blood cells, which carry oxygen to the body's tissue. Without the right amount of iron, your body can't make enough of what red blood cells need to carry oxygen. This will leave you feeling tired and out of breath. Sickle cell anemia . About 1 out of every 100 Latinos and 1 out of every 12 African-Americans have the sickle cell trait, meaning those populations are much more greatly affected by sickle cell anemia than others. Stress can lead to health problems due to carrying the sickle cell trait. Vitamin-deficiency anemia,\xa0specifically B12 or folate, occurs when a lack of the vitamin causes the body to produce red blood cells that are too large and can't work properly."", ""Bone marrow and stem cell problems may keep your body from producing enough red blood cells. Some of the stem cells in the marrow that’s in the center of your bones will develop into red blood cells. If there aren’t enough stem cells, if they don’t work right, or if they’re replaced by other cells such as cancer cells, you might get anemia. Anemia caused by bone marrow or stem cell problems includes: Aplastic anemia happens when you don’t have enough stem cells or have none at all. You might get aplastic anemia because of your genes or because your bone marrow was injured by medications , radiation, chemotherapy , or infection. Other conditions that commonly affect the bone marrow include\xa0multiple myeloma and leukemia. Sometimes, there’s no clear cause of aplastic anemia. Lead poisoning . Lead is toxic to your bone marrow, causing you to have fewer red blood cells. Lead poisoning can happen when adults come into contact with lead at work, for example, or if children eat chips of lead paint . You can also get it if your food comes into contact with some types of pottery that aren’t glazed right. Thalassemia happens with a problem with hemoglobin formation (four chains aren't correctly formed). You make really small red blood cells, though you can make enough of them to be asymptomatic, or it can be severe. It’s passed down in your genes and usually affects people of Mediterranean, African, Middle Eastern, and Southeast Asian descent. This condition can range from mild to life-threatening; the most severe form is called Cooley's anemia. Iron-deficiency anemia happens because you don’t have enough of the mineral iron in your body. Your bone marrow needs iron to make hemoglobin, the part of the red blood cell that takes oxygen to your organs. Iron-deficiency anemia can be caused by: A diet without enough iron, especially in infants, children, teens, vegans, and vegetarians Certain drugs, foods, and caffeinated drinks Digestive conditions such as Crohn's disease , or if you’ve had part of your stomach or small intestine removed Donating blood often Endurance training Pregnancy and breastfeeding using up iron in your body Your period A\xa0common cause is chronic slow bleed, usually from your digestive system."", 'Sickle cell anemia is a disorder that, in the U.S., affects mainly African Americans and Hispanic Americans. Your red blood cells, which are usually round, become crescent-shaped because of a problem in your genes. Anemia results when the red blood cells break down quickly, so oxygen doesn’t get to your organs. The crescent-shaped red blood cells can also get stuck in tiny blood vessels and cause pain . Vitamin-deficiency anemia can happen when you aren’t getting enough vitamin B12 and folate. You need these two vitamins to make red blood cells. This kind of anemia can be caused by: Dietary deficiency: If you eat little or no meat, you might not get enough vitamin B12. If you overcook vegetables or don’t eat enough of them, you might not get enough folate. Megaloblastic anemia: When you don’t get enough vitamin B12, folate, or both Pernicious anemia: When your body doesn’t absorb enough vitamin B12 Other causes of vitamin deficiency include medications, alcohol abuse , and intestinal diseases such as tropical sprue.', ""Anemia linked to other chronic conditions usually occurs in the setting of long-standing inflammation. Inflammatory proteins slow the bone marrow's production of young red blood cells in a variety of ways.\xa0Conditions that cause this type of anemia include: Advanced kidney disease Hypothyroidism Old age Long-term diseases, such as cancer, infection, lupus , diabetes , and rheumatoid arthritis Anemia caused by destruction of red blood cells When red blood cells are fragile and can’t handle the stress of traveling through your body, they may burst, causing what’s called hemolytic anemia . You might have this condition at birth, or it could come later. Sometimes, the causes of hemolytic anemia are unclear, but they can include: An attack by your immune system , as with lupus . This can happen to anyone, even a baby still in the womb or a newborn. That’s called hemolytic disease of the newborn . Conditions that can be passed down through your genes, such as sickle cell anemia, thalassemia, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) An enlarged spleen . This can, in rare cases, trap red blood cells and destroy them too early. Something that puts strain on your body, such as infections, drugs, snake or spider venom, or certain foods Toxins from advanced liver or kidney disease Vascular grafts, prosthetic heart valves, tumors, severe burns , being around certain chemicals, severe hypertension , and clotting disorders"", 'Anemia Diagnosis A complete blood count ( CBC ) test will\xa0measure your red blood cells, hemoglobin, and other parts of your blood. Your doctor will ask about your family history and your medical history after the CBC. They’ll probably do some tests, including: Blood smear or differential to count your white blood cells, check the shape of your red blood cells, and look for unusual cells Reticulocyte count to check for immature red blood cells', 'Anemia Treatment Your treatment will depend on your type of anemia. If you have aplastic anemia, you might need medication, blood transfusions (in which you get blood from another person), or a bone marrow transplant (in which you get a donor’s stem cells). If you have hemolytic anemia, you might need medication that will hold back your immune system. Your primary care doctor may refer you to a\xa0doctor who specializes in vascular problems. If it’s caused by blood loss, you might have surgery to find and fix the bleeding.\xa0If you have iron-deficiency anemia, you’ll probably need to take iron supplements and change your diet. Sickle cell anemia treatment includes painkillers, folic acid supplements, intermittent antibiotics , or oxygen therapy. A drug called hydroxyurea ( Droxia , Hydrea , Siklos ) is often prescribed to decrease sickle cell pain crises (complicated mechanism). The medication called voxelotor ( Oxbryta ) can help your red blood cells keep their proper shape. Crizanlizumab-tmca ( Adakveo ) can keep blood cells from sticking together and blocking vessels. L-glutamine oral powder ( Endari ) can cut down on your trips to the hospital for pain and also guard against a condition called acute chest syndrome. If you have a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, you will be prescribed supplements.. Thalassemia doesn’t usually need treatment, but if your case is severe, you might have blood transfusions, a bone marrow transplant, or surgery.', ""Anemia diet To treat anemia, eat an iron-rich diet. If you don't eat enough iron, your body can become iron-deficient. Some foods that have high amounts of iron include: Meats Eggs Leafy green veggies Iron-fortified foods like cereals Beans Seafood Peas Nuts and dried fruit Lentils"", ""Anemia home remedies Eating a diet with iron-rich foods is one way to treat your anemia at home. Anemia supplements. You can also take supplements, which will increase the amount of iron and hemoglobin in your body. Ferrous sulfate comes in liquid and tablet forms. Usually, the serving size is 325 milligrams. Talk to your doctor about taking an iron supplement for anemia and see how they recommend taking it. But typically, you'll want to take it on an empty stomach. Don't combine your supplement with milk, caffeine, or calcium supplements. It may help to increase absorption to take your supplement with vitamin C such as a glass of orange juice. Anemia complications"", ""Anemia can lead to severe tiredness, making it very hard to get through your day. It can also lead to an arrhythmia, or irregular heartbeat. Because there isn't as much oxygen in the blood, the heart must pump more, which could lead to heart failure. Anemia can even be fatal, especially if you lose a lot of blood too quickly. Anemia and Pregnancy When you get pregnant, your body goes through many changes. Your body produces 20% to 30% more blood, which means you need more iron and vitamins. A lot of people don't have enough iron for their second and third trimesters, which could lead to anemia. While mild anemia is normal during pregnancy, severe anemia could put your baby at risk for anemia as well. If you're severely anemic during your first two trimesters, you're at a higher risk of having a preterm delivery or a baby with a low birth weight. People who are pregnant and anemic are also at a higher risk of blood loss during labor and may have a harder time fighting infections."", ""During pregnancy, you need 27 milligrams of iron each day. You can take prenatal vitamins that contain iron to help prevent or treat an iron deficiency during pregnancy. Your doctor might also give you a different iron supplement. You can also eat more iron-rich foods to help with your iron deficiency. If you do these things and still have anemia, your doctor might suggest testing to find other potential causes. If your anemia is due to iron deficiency, they'll have you take more iron supplements. But if you had a history of gastric bypass, small bowel surgery, or you aren't able to take an iron supplement, your doctor will give you iron through an IV (intravenous) needle.""]"
33,Sideroblastic Anemia,"['If you have anemia , chances are there’s not enough iron inside your blood cells.\xa0That lack of iron -- the most common form of anemia -- means you’re also not producing enough hemoglobin, the protein in your red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout your body. As a result, you don’t feel as energetic as you should. You might become tired , dizzy, or have a tough time falling asleep. However, if your doctor diagnoses you with sideroblastic anemia, also known as SA, you have too much iron in your blood cells. SA forces bone marrow to produce abnormal red blood cells . Those cells contain too much iron, so they can’t effectively make hemoglobin. The symptoms of SA are similar to other types of anemia. You might feel tired , irritable, and find it difficult to breathe . Other symptoms of SA include: Pale skin color Rapid heart rate , or tachycardia Headaches Heart palpitations Weakness and fatigue Chest pain', 'Types of SA There are two main types of sideroblastic anemia: inherited and acquired.', 'Inherited SA is a rare genetic condition. In other words, you get it from one of your parents. The most common form of inherited SA is known as X-linked sideroblastic anemia. It’s caused by a mutation, or change, in a gene that disrupts normal hemoglobin production. Your body tries to make up for the shortage of hemoglobin by absorbing more iron from food. In the most severe cases, inherited SA can cause organ damage, especially to the liver . Inherited SA is uncommon and is usually diagnosed before age\xa030. Acquired forms of sideroblastic anemia are more common and are often reversible. Although doctors don’t know the exact cause of acquired SA in most people, you can get the disease by using certain prescription drugs (mainly for tuberculosis ) and by drinking alcohol . It’s also caused by extended contact with certain toxic chemicals, or from other illnesses such as immune disorders , tumors, or metabolic diseases. About 10% of people with acquired SA develop leukemia . People with SA (both inherited and acquired) might also develop hemochromatosis , a common iron-overload disease.', 'Diagnosing SA Diagnosing sideroblastic anemia can be tricky because its symptoms are similar to other types of anemia. Plus, SA progresses slowly and you might not know you have it. You need to listen to your body. If you have any of the symptoms of SA, talk to your doctor. Blood tests and other procedures will tell your doctor whether you have SA or not. Your doctor may also order MRI and genetic testing.', 'Treating SA There are several treatment options for SA, but it depends on whether you’re diagnosed with acquired or inherited SA. Your doctor might have you eat more foods or take supplements rich in vitamin B6 ( pyridoxine ).\xa0Studies show that vitamin B6 may help with both acquired and inherited SA. You can also take medication to get rid of some of the extra iron in your body. Your doctor might consider an infusion of deferoxamine ( Desferal ) under your skin (subcutaneously) or injected into a muscle (intramuscular). Deferasirox ( Exjade ) is a pill that also seems to work, but can cause kidney problems. Your doctor can also order a blood transfusion , especially if you don’t respond to vitamin B6 therapy . However, there are drawbacks. A transfusion could make your iron levels\xa0worse and lead to liver damage. A bone marrow transplant is the treatment of last resort.']"
34,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,"['What Is Abnormal Uterine Bleeding? Abnormal uterine bleeding is when you bleed outside of your normal monthly period. You might hear it called anovulatory bleeding. Your flow could also be heavier or last longer than what’s typical. When it comes to menstrual cycles, there’s a wide range of “normal.” But your period shouldn’t be a problem for you month after month. If it’s so heavy or unpredictable that it keeps you from doing some activities or makes you miss work or school, you may have a medical condition that should be treated.', 'Abnormal Uterine Bleeding Symptoms The signs of abnormal uterine bleeding include: Heavy period Bleeding between your periods, after sex, or during menopause Long periods (more than 7 days) Irregular periods Doctors check these things when diagnosing abnormal uterine bleeding : How often you get your period. It should be fairly regular. The length of each cycle shouldn’t change by more than a week. If it’s shorter than 3 weeks or longer than 5, that could be a sign of a problem. How long it lasts. A typical period lasts 4 or 5 days. If yours is often less than 2 days or longer than a week, that could mean something’s wrong. How heavy it is. Most women only lose about 2 tablespoons of blood each period. More than 5 tablespoons is thought to be unusually heavy, but that’s hard to judge. Let your doctor know if you need more than one tampon or pad in an hour. Abnormally heavy menstrual bleeding is called menorrhagia . Whether you have spotting between periods. Whether you have bleeding after sex.', 'If you could be pregnant or you’re past menopause and have any kind of bleeding, call your doctor. Some spotting is common early in pregnancy, but bleeding can be a sign of a serious condition called an ectopic pregnancy . That’s when a fertilized egg implants somewhere outside your uterus, most commonly in a fallopian tube. It could also mean you’re having a miscarriage . After menopause, women who take hormone replacement therapy may still have periods. But any bleeding should be checked out.', 'Abnormal Uterine Bleeding Causes There are a few possible causes of abnormal uterine bleeding: Hormone changes. Problems with your hormones are the most common reason for abnormal uterine bleeding. When one of your ovaries releases an egg (called ovulation ), certain hormones tell your body to build up and then shed the lining of your uterus (called the endometrium ). With teenagers and women getting close to menopause, the endometrium can build up too much. That can lead to an irregular or heavy period or spotting between periods.', 'These things can throw off your hormones, too: Birth control pills and other medicines like warfarin and hormone therapy Fast weight loss or gain Emotional or physical stress An intrauterine device (IUD) Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) Problems with your uterus. Another possible reason for abnormal bleeding is a physical problem with your uterus. Millions of women have fibroids -- noncancerous tumors that grow in the muscles of the wall of the uterus. A polyp is another kind of growth that can form in the lining of your uterus. A condition called adenomyosis is where the cells similar to the ones that grow in the lining of the uterus start to grow in the muscle part of the uterus. Endometriosis can also cause abnormal bleeding. This is when tissue like the kind that lines the inside of your uterus grows outside of your uterus. Other health conditions. These are much less common, but abnormal uterine bleeding also can result from: Cancer of the cervix , endometrium, or uterus Illnesses that affect your kidneys , liver , thyroid , or adrenal glands Infection of your cervix or endometrium Sexually transmitted diseases', 'Abnormal Uterine Bleeding Diagnosis It can help to take detailed notes over a few cycles so you can give the doctor specific information about your symptoms. They’ll also ask about your overall health and give you a physical exam . You’ll probably get a pregnancy test , and you may also have: Blood work. Heavy bleeding can leave your body short of iron. A blood test can see if that’s a problem for you. It can also show if your hormones are out of balance or if you have a blood disorder or chronic disease. Ultrasound . This uses sound waves to make images of the inside of your uterus so your doctor can look for fibroids or polyps. Hysteroscopy. The doctor will look inside your uterus with a tiny lighted scope that they put in through your cervix. Biopsy . The doctor may take out a small piece of tissue and check it under a microscope for abnormal cells. Magnetic resonance imaging . This test uses radio waves and powerful magnets to make detailed pictures of your uterus. It isn’t used that often, but it can help spot adenomyosis.', 'Abnormal Uterine Bleeding Treatment Your treatment\xa0will depend on the cause of the abnormal uterine bleeding. If a chronic illness or a blood disorder is at the root of your symptoms, treating that can help. Treatment also can depend on whether you plan to have children. It might not be safe to get pregnant after some treatments, while others can make it impossible. If you’re close to menopause, the doctor may want to take a wait-and-see approach because your symptoms may get better on their own. Drugs are usually the first thing your doctor will try. They include: Hormones. Birth control pills and other hormone treatments may be able to give you regular menstrual cycles and lighter periods. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa) and GnRHA antagonists. These control heavy bleeding by stopping your body from making certain hormones. They may shrink fibroids for a while. They’re usually used along with other treatments. NSAIDS . If you take anti-inflammatories like ibuprofen or naproxen a few days before your period starts, they may help lighten the bleeding. Tranexamic acid . This is a pill that helps your blood clot and can control heavy uterine bleeding. IUD. For some women, an IUD that releases a hormone called progestin can stop heavy bleeding. Many women who use one don’t get a period at all. They may not be right for you if you have fibroids in the cavity of your uterus rather than the wall. Sometimes you might need surgery to stop the bleeding: Endometrial ablation. This uses heat, cold, electricity, or a laser to destroy the lining of your uterus. It may end your periods entirely. You probably won’t be able to get pregnant after having it done, but it can be dangerous if you do. You’ll need to use birth control until menopause. Myomectomy or uterine artery embolization. If you have fibroids, the doctor may take them out or cut off the vessels that supply them with blood. Hysterectomy . This is when the doctor removes your uterus. You may need a hysterectomy if your fibroids are very large or you have endometrial or uterine cancer . Otherwise, it’s a last resort when other treatments haven’t worked.', 'Abnormal Uterine Bleeding Complications Complications that may happen with abnormal uterine bleeding include: Trouble getting pregnant Anemia or blood loss']"
35,Avascular Necrosis (AVN or Osteonecrosis),"['What Is Avascular Necrosis? Avascular necrosis (AVN) is the death of bone tissue due to a loss of blood supply.\xa0 You might also hear it called osteonecrosis, aseptic necrosis, or ischemic bone necrosis. If it isn’t treated, AVN can cause the bone to collapse. AVN most often affects your hip. Other possible\xa0sites are the shoulder , knees , and ankles .', 'Symptoms of Avascular Necrosis In its earliest stages, AVN may have no symptoms, but as the disease progresses it typically becomes very painful. At first, it might only hurt when you put pressure on the affected bone. Then, pain may become constant. If the bone and surrounding joint collapse, you may have severe pain that makes you unable to use your joint. The time between the first symptoms and bone collapse can range from several months to more than a year.', 'Causes and Risk Factors for Avascular Necrosis Things that can make avascular necrosis more likely include: Alcohol. Several drinks a day can cause fat deposits to form in your blood, which lower the blood supply to your bones. Bisphosphonates. These medications that boost bone density could lead to osteonecrosis of the jaw. This could be more likely if you’re taking them for multiple myeloma or metastatic breast cancer. Medical treatments. Radiation therapy for cancer can weaken bones. Other conditions linked to AVN include organ transplants, like kidney transplants. Steroid drugs. Long-term use of these inflammation -fighting drugs, either by mouth or in a vein, leads to 35% of all cases of nontraumatic AVN. Doctors don’t know why, but longtime use of medications like prednisone can lead to AVN. They think the meds can raise fat levels in your blood, which lowers blood flow. Trauma. Breaking or dislocating a hip can damage nearby blood vessels and cut the blood supply to your bones. AVN may affect 20% or more of people who dislocate a hip. Blood clots , inflammation , and damage to your arteries . All of these can block blood flow to your bones. Other conditions associated with nontraumatic AVN include: Decompression sickness, which causes gas bubbles in your blood Diabetes Gaucher disease ,\xa0in which a fatty substance collects in the organs HIV Long-term use of drugs called bisphosphonates to treat cancers like multiple myeloma or breast cancer, which can lead to AVN of the jaw. Pancreatitis , inflammation of the pancreas Radiation therapy or chemotherapy Autoimmune diseases such as lup www.webmd.com/lupus/arthritis-lupus us Sickle cell disease', 'Who Gets Avascular Necrosis? As many as 20,000 people develop AVN each year. Most are between ages 20 and 50. For healthy people, the risk of AVN is small. Most cases are the result of an underlying health problem or injury.', 'Avascular Necrosis Diagnosis Your doctor will start with a physical exam. They’ll press on your joints to check for tender spots. They’ll move your joints through a series of positions to check your range of motion. You might get one of these imaging tests to look for what’s causing your pain: Bone scan. The doctor injects radioactive material into your vein. It travels to spots where bones are injured or healing and shows up on the image. MRI and CT scan. These give your doctor detailed images showing early changes in bone that might be a sign of AVN. X-rays. They’ll be normal for early stages of AVN but can show bone changes that appear later on.', 'Avascular Necrosis Treatment Treatment goals for AVN are to improve the joint, stop the bone damage, and ease pain. The best treatment will depend on a number of things, like: Your age Stage of the disease Location and amount of bone damage Cause of AVN If you catch avascular necrosis early, treatment may involve taking medications to relieve pain or limiting the use of the affected area. If your hip, knee , or ankle is affected, you may need crutches to take\xa0weight\xa0off the damaged joint. Your doctor may also recommend range-of-motion exercises to help keep the joint mobile. Medications. If the doctor knows what’s causing your avascular necrosis, treatment will include efforts to manage it. This can include: Blood thinners. You’ll get these if your AVN is caused by blood clots. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). These will help with pain. Cholesterol drugs. They cut the amount of cholesterol and fat in your blood, which can help prevent the blockages that lead to AVN. Surgery. While these nonsurgical treatments may slow down the avascular necrosis, most people with the condition eventually need surgery. Surgical options include: Bone grafts . Removing healthy bone from one part of the body and using it to replace the damaged bone Osteotomy . Cutting the bone and changing its alignment to relieve stress on the bone or joint Total joint replacement . Removing the damaged joint and replacing it with a synthetic joint Core decompression . Removing part of the inside of the bone to relieve pressure and allow new blood vessels to form Vascularized bone graft. Using your own tissue to rebuild diseased or damaged hip joints. The surgeon first removes the bone with the poor blood supply from the hip, then replaces it with the blood-vessel-rich bone from another site, such as the fibula, the smaller bone in your lower leg. Electrical stimulation. An electrical current could jump-start new bone growth. Your doctor might use it during surgery or give you a special gadget for it.', 'Caring for Avascular Necrosis at Home You can do these things to help: Rest. Stay off the joint. This can help slow damage. You might need to hold back on physical activity or use crutches for several months. Exercise. A physical therapist can show you the right moves to get range of motion back in your joint.', ""Prevention To lower your risk of AVN: Cut back on alcohol. Heavy drinking is a leading risk factor for AVN. Keep your cholesterol in check. Small bits of fat are the most common thing blocking blood supply to you bones. Use steroids carefully. Your doctor should keep tabs on you while you’re taking these medications. Let them know if you’ve used them in the past. Taking them over and over again can worsen bone damage. Don't smoke. It boosts your AVN risk."", 'Prognosis for Avascular Necrosis More than half the people with this condition need surgery within 3 years of diagnosis. If a bone collapse in one of your joints, you’re more likely to have it happen in another.', 'Your outlook depends on several things: Disease stage at the time you were diagnosed If you have an underlying condition You’re less likely to do well if: You’re over 50. You’re at stage III or higher when you’re diagnosed. More than a third of the bone’s weight-bearing area is dead. The damage goes past the end of the bone. You have a long history of cortisone treatments.']"
36,Pancreatic Cancer,"['Pancreatic cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancerous) cells form in the tissues of the pancreas . The pancreas is a gland located behind the stomach and in front of the spine. The pancreas produces digestive juices and hormones that regulate blood sugar. Cells called exocrine pancreas cells produce the digestive juices, while cells called endocrine pancreas cells produce the hormones. The majority of pancreatic cancers start in the exocrine cells.', 'Pancreatic Cancer Symptoms Symptoms of pancreatic cancer include: Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes ) Pain in the upper or middle abdomen and back Unexplained weight loss Loss of appetite Fatigue Depression', 'Pancreatic Cancer Risk Factors The factors which could put you at risk for developing pancreatic cancer include: Smoking Chronic pancreatitis ( inflammation of the pancreas) Inherited conditions (including hereditary pancreatitis ) Familial pancreatic cancer syndromes Long-standing diabetes Obesity', 'How Is Pancreatic Cancer Diagnosed? After taking down your health history and performing a physical exam , the doctor may order several tests to determine the cause of your problem or extent of the condition, including: CT scan (computed tomography) MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) Laparoscopy (surgical procedure to look at organs) Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC; procedure used to X-ray liver and bile ducts) Biopsy (removal of tissue to view it under a microscope)', 'Pancreatic Cancer Treatment There are various treatments for pancreatic cancer , including surgery, chemotherapy , and radiation therapy . Chemotherapy uses drugs to treat cancer , while radiation therapy uses X-rays or other kinds of radiation to kill cancer cells. Surgery can be used to remove a tumor or to treat symptoms of pancreatic cancer .', 'What Is the Outlook for Pancreatic Cancer? The American Cancer Society reports that only about 23% of patients with cancer of the exocrine pancreas are still living one year after diagnosis. About 8.2% are still alive\xa0five years after being diagnosed.']"
37,Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura,"['Background Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), also known as primary immune thrombocytopenic purpura and autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura, is defined as isolated thrombocytopenia with normal bone marrow and in the absence of other causes of thrombocytopenia. ITP has two distinct clinical syndromes, manifesting as an acute condition in children and a chronic condition in adults.', 'Pathophysiology ITP is primarily a disease of increased peripheral platelet destruction, with most patients having antibodies to specific platelet membrane glycoproteins. Relative marrow failure may contribute to this condition, since studies show that most patients have either normal or diminished platelet production. Acute ITP often follows an acute infection and has a spontaneous resolution within 2 months. Chronic ITP persists longer than 6 months without a specific cause.', 'Epidemiology Frequency United States Incidence rates are as follows: The incidence of ITP in adults is approximately 66 cases per 1,000,000 per year. An average estimate of the incidence in children is 50 cases per 1,000,000 per year. New cases of chronic refractory ITP comprise approximately 10 cases per 1,000,000 per year.', 'International According to studies in Denmark and England, childhood ITP occurs in approximately 10-40 cases per 1,000,000 per year. A prospective, population-based study in Norway indicated an incidence of 53 per 1,000,000 in children younger than 15 years.\xa0A study in Kuwait reported a higher incidence of 125 cases per 1,000,000 per year. Mortality/Morbidity Hemorrhage represents the most serious complication; intracranial hemorrhage is the most significant. The mortality rate from hemorrhage is approximately 1% in children and 5% in adults. In patients with severe thrombocytopenia, predicted 5-year mortality rates from bleeding are significantly raised in patients older than age 60 and those under age 40 --\xa047.8% versus 2.2%, respectively. Older age and previous history of hemorrhage increase the risk of severe bleeding in adult ITP. Spontaneous remission occurs in more than 80% of cases in children. However, it is uncommon in adults. Age See the list below: Peak prevalence occurs in adults ages\xa020-50. Peak prevalence occurs in children ages\xa02-4. Approximately 40% of all patients are younger than age 10.', 'Sex- and Age-related Demographics In chronic ITP (adults), the female-to-male ratio is 2.6:1. More than 72% of patients older than age 10 are female. In acute ITP (children), distribution is equal between males (52%) and females (48%). In adults, the peak prevalence is from ages 20 to 50.\xa0In children, peak prevalence is from ages 2 to 4.\xa0Approximately 40% of all patients are younger than age 10.
