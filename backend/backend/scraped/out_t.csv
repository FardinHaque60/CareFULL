0,Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT): What Is It?,"['What Is Supraventricular Tachycardia? Supraventricular tachycardia is when your heart beats faster than normal when you\'re at rest. Photo credit: (Natthawut Thongchomphoonuch/Dreamstime) Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is a type of arrhythmia, or an irregular heartbeat, where your heart beats erratically or fast. Also called paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, SVT affects the upper chambers of your heart. The name is from Latin. Supraventricular means ""above the ventricles,"" which are the lower two sections of your heart. Tachycardia, pronounced (tack-eh-CARD-ee-uh), is what doctors call a fast heartbeat. Bouts of SVT can last from a few seconds to a few hours, and your heart can beat as fast as 220 times a minute. During an episode, you might have a drop in blood pressure and feel dizzy or lightheaded. Other times, the only thing you feel is your rapid heartbeat. SVT usually doesn\'t cause serious health problems, but you should see your doctor if you have symptoms. SVT vs. VTACH People sometimes confuse SVT with a similar condition called ventricular tachycardia (VTACH). VTACH is also a type of an irregular heartbeat. But it starts in your heart\'s ventricles, which are the lower two chambers, instead of your heart\'s atria, the upper two chambers.', ""VTACH is more common in older people with underlying heart issues. Usually, SVT isn't as serious as VTACH. Who does SVT affect? SVT usually affects younger people. It often starts when you're in your teens or early 20s. But young children, middle-aged people, or older people can also have SVT. SVT is more common in women or those assigned female at birth, especially during pregnancy."", ""How Does Your Heart Beat? Your heart is a muscular organ that pumps about 2,000 gallons of blood a day to send oxygen-rich blood to your body. It has four pumping chambers to do the job: the left and right atria at the top and the left and right ventricles on the bottom. Your heart also has something of a natural pacemaker . It's called the sinoatrial node or SA node. It's at the top of your heart and sends electrical signals that keep it beating the right way. The electrical signal from the SA node makes the muscles of the upper two chambers squeeze, pumping blood into the lower two chambers. Then the signal moves down and causes the muscles of the lower two chambers to squeeze. That sends blood to your body."", 'The heart beats like this in a familiar ""lub-dub"" pattern some 50-99 times a minute if you\'re at rest. The heartbeat normally raises and drops in speed based on signals that get sent to the SA node. During a bout of SVT, these signals don\'t happen normally. The electrical signals in the upper chambers fire off early, causing them to squeeze too soon. That interrupts the main electrical signal coming from the SA node. This makes the heart beat very quickly and irregularly.', ""Types of SVT There are a few types of SVT : Atrioventricular (AV) nodal reentrant tachycardia: This is the most common form, especially among young women. If you have it, there's an extra pathway in your heart near the AV node . This pathway, known as a reentrant circuit, causes an electrical signal to circle around and around instead of moving down to your heart's lower chambers. This triggers the sudden, rapid heartbeat. AV reciprocating tachycardia: This happens when you have an abnormal pathway linking your heart's upper and lower chambers causing the signal to move around and around in a big loop. This type of SVT is more common in younger people. It also affects people with an inherited condition called Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome ."", 'Atrial tachycardia: This happens when a\xa0short circuit in your heart\'s right or left atrium triggers a faulty electrical signal. It usually affects people who have heart disease. Sinus tachycardia: This is when your heart beats quickly but at a normal rhythm. A fast heartbeat is normal with exercise or stress but shouldn\'t happen when you\'re resting. Causes of this type of SVT include certain medications, illegal drugs, fever, pain, and some medical conditions. If a faster heartbeat doesn\'t go away when the stressful situation ends or you stop exercising, talk with your doctor. Sinus tachycardia usually isn\'t dangerous, but your doctor can rule out more serious heart-related issues. Paroxysmal SVT: "" Paroxysmal "" means that something happens in occasional bursts. This type of SVT usually affects young people who do engage in intense exercise. Other tachycardia There are several other types of tachycardia, including : Sinus nodal reentrant tachycardia Junctional ectopic tachycardia Nonparoxysmal junctional tachycardia Premature atrial contractions Accessory pathway tachycardias such as Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome Multifocal atrial tachycardia Atrial fibrillation Atrial flutter', 'SVT Causes SVT is usually caused by things you can\'t control, such as a medical condition or previous surgery. Sometimes, an episode is triggered by stress, exercise, or lack of sleep, though it usually happens without any obvious reason. Medical conditions Health conditions that can cause your heart to race include: Lung disease Thyroid disease Heart failure or other heart disease Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome Certain medications Some medications for asthma, allergies, and colds can affect your heartbeat. Talk with your doctor if you\'re concerned that your medications might be causing SVT episodes. Congenital issues "" Congenital "" means something that you\'re born with. Some people are born with an extra electrical pathway or abnormal electrical circuits in their heart that can cause arrhythmias like SVT. Heart surgery If you\'ve had heart surgery, scar tissue can change how electrical signals pass through your heart. Other things that can trigger SVT Your heart is more likely to race when you: Are under a lot of stress Have anxiety Drink a lot of caffeine and alcohol Smoke or use tobacco Abuse drugs like cocaine or methamphetamine, also called crystal meth Are pregnant', ""SVT Risk Factors You're at a high risk of some types of SVT if you're middle-aged or older and when you're pregnant. Several health conditions raise your risk, including: Heart disease (coronary artery disease, heart failure, disease of the heart muscle or valve) Lung disease Thyroid disease Diabetes Sleep apnea Smoking and using illicit drugs are also risk factors for SVT."", ""SVT Symptoms During SVT, you might have a rapid heartbeat or heart palpitations (feeling like your heart is pounding or fluttering). When your heart beats too fast, it doesn't have time to fully refill with blood between beats. That means it can't send enough blood to your body. This can cause: Chest pain Dizziness Fatigue Shortness of breath Fainting Sweating Weakness A pounding feeling in the neck Rarely, SVT can cause unconsciousness or cardiac arrest. And sometimes, SVT doesn't cause any symptoms. It might be harder to notice symptoms in young children. In infants, look for sweating, pale skin, fast pulse , vomiting, and poor feeding. If you feel like your heart is fluttering and you have any of these symptoms, call your doctor to be tested for SVT."", ""SVT Diagnosis and Tests If you have symptoms, your doctor will ask you detailed questions. They'll want to know how old you were when you first noticed a problem. They'll also ask when and how your symptoms began. That includes whether you were exercising when you noticed things such as a rapid pulse, dizziness , or a hard time breathing. Other things they'll ask you about: Whether your symptoms came on suddenly or slowly What they feel like and how long they last If you have a fast heartbeat after caffeine or stress If you or anyone in your family has had heart problems or procedures During your exam, your doctor will listen to your heart and lungs with a stethoscope. They might also: Feel your thyroid gland on your neck Get your temperature and measure your blood pressure Take a small blood sample with a thin needle Electrocardiogram (EKG) test If your doctor suspects you have SVT, they want you to have an EKG . This test records your heart's rhythm over time, so if it's not beating as it should, it can tell your doctor what the problem is."", ""To set up the test, a nurse or technician will attach six sticky patches that stick to you skin called electrodes on your chest and others on your arms and legs. If you have a hairy chest, an aide may need to shave small areas so they stay on. Each patch is attached to a wire that leads to a machine. During the short test, you'll be asked to lie still and breathe normally. Home monitoring You might have symptoms just once in a while, so a single EKG in the doctor's office may not reveal an abnormal heart rate. In these cases, you might need to wear a device for longer so doctors can record your heart while you're having symptoms. You may be sent home with one of the following: A Holter monitor is a small, battery-powered EKG that records your heart's activity for 24-48 hours. The device is about the size of a small camera and has little electrodes that are placed on your chest. You can do most of your daily activities, but you shouldn't bathe or shower with it on. An event monitor is also a portable EKG but might be more practical when you have symptoms less than once a day. You can wear it for longer than a Holter. You just press a button on the device when you're having symptoms. The monitor records details only while you feel a fast heartbeat. Your doctor may ask you to wear it for days or weeks."", 'Further tests If you\'re diagnosed based on the results of an EKG, you may need more tests to figure out what type of SVT you have and what\'s causing it. Often, this can include what\'s called an ""electrophysiology study"" so that doctors can learn how the different sections of your heart are sending electrical signals to each other. For this test, you\'re sedated at a hospital or clinic and soft, flexible wires are passed through your veins into your heart. You\'ll need someone to drive you to and from your appointment. Talk to your doctor about how to prepare. Doctors might also recommend more testing, such as an echocardiogram, an implanted loop recorder, or a stress test. An echocardiogram uses sound waves to create a video of your heartbeat. A doctor implants a loop recorder below the skin of your chest to listen for unusual heart rhythms. During a stress test, you run on a treadmill or take medicine to make your heart speed up. While this happens, the doctor monitors your heartbeat.', ""SVT Treatment Usually, SVT doesn't require any treatment. If it bothers you, your doctor can choose from among several different treatments. They include: Carotid sinus massage A carotid sinus massage is when your doctor rubs your neck along your carotid artery, which causes your heart to slow down. Only experienced professionals should do this. Never try it on your own. Vagal maneuvers Sometimes, certain actions can relieve SVT. Try coughing, holding your breath, putting an ice pack on your face, or pushing as if you're about to poop. These can calm the vagus nerve , which runs from the lower part of your brain through your neck to your stomach and controls your heart rate. Your doctor can show you how to do these maneuvers safely. Medications Some medications can help keep your heartbeat under control. If you regularly have episodes of SVT, your doctor might prescribe: Adenosine (Adenocard) Atropine (AtroPen) Beta-blockers Calcium channel blockers Digoxin (Digitek) Potassium channel blockers Follow your doctor's directions for taking each medication, and talk with them about potential side effects."", ""Cardioversion In an emergency, a doctor can place a set of paddles or patches on your chest to deliver an electric shock to your heart. This helps your heartbeat return to normal. Catheter ablation For this treatment, doctors thread tiny tubes (called catheters ) through a vein to your heart. These release a pulse of heat or cold that destroys the abnormal electrical pathway that causes SVT. Pacemaker In rare cases, a surgeon can put a tiny device called a pacemaker in your chest. When your heart isn't beating normally, this device delivers a small shock to help it return to its regular rhythm."", ""Lifestyle and Home Remedies When you have SVT, it's important to take care of your heart. Make sure to visit your doctor regularly. They can prescribe medications and recommend healthy habits to help manage blood pressure , cholesterol, and other issues that affect your heart. Some healthy lifestyle habits include: Stick to a heart-healthy diet . Include plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Drink enough water . Dehydration can trigger SVT. Exercise . Try walking, swimming, gardening, or other forms of physical activity. Talk with your doctor about finding a routine that's right for you. Don't smoke . Don't be afraid to ask for help with quitting. Find your healthy weight . Talk with your doctor about how to maintain a weight that's right for you. Avoid alcohol . If you drink, do it in moderation: 1-2 drinks a day for most people, depending on your weight and age. Limit coffee or tea . Moderate amounts are usually harmless, but avoid drinking too much. Don't do illegal drugs . Cocaine, methamphetamines, and other drugs can trigger an irregular heartbeat. Talk with your doctor about getting help. Manage stress . Try coping strategies like yoga, meditation, or mindfulness. Get enough sleep . This helps some people to avoid SVT. Foods to avoid with SVT Some foods and beverages can trigger SVT episodes and raise your risk of other heart issues. Along with caffeine and alcohol, consider avoiding those that contain a lot of: Salt Saturated fat Sugar Carbohydrates"", ""SVT Complications SVT is usually not life-threatening. But in rare cases, it can make you faint or even cause a cardiac arrest. Eventually, too many bouts of SVT can weaken your heart. That's especially true if you also have other health conditions. Some SVT treatments, including medications and ablation, can cause side effects. Talk with your doctor about managing these complications."", 'SVT Prevention The best way to avoid SVT is to adopt a heart-healthy lifestyle. If you already have SVT, try to identify what triggers your irregular heartbeat. Keep a diary of your episodes. Write down your heart rate, symptoms, and activities that might have caused the SVT (such as drinking coffee or smoking a cigarette). Over time, this will help you identify patterns and take steps to avoid these triggers. If your doctor has prescribed medication for SVT, take it exactly as directed.', 'When Should I See the Doctor? If this is your first time having an irregular heartbeat or the episode lasts more than a few seconds, call your doctor.', ""When should I go to the ER for SVT? Get medical help immediately if you have sudden chest pain and are short of breath or if you've been diagnosed with SVT and your heart has been racing for 30 minutes or more."", ""SVT Takeaways SVT is when you have a fast or an erratic heartbeat. It can be caused by faulty electrical signals in your heart or by stress exercise, and other triggers. SVT isn't life-threatening, and most people don't need treatment. If you do, you can control it with medication and lifestyle changes."", ""SVT FAQs Is SVT life-threatening? SVT is rarely life-threatening. But untreated episodes can weaken your heart and could cause heart failure, especially if you already have other medical or heart problems. When should I be concerned about SVT? Call 911 if your rapid heartbeat doesn't return to normal after a few minutes. Also call 911 if you have chest pain, trouble breathing, or you feel dizzy or weak.""]"
1,Tai Chi and Qi Gong,"['How It Works The ancient Chinese practices of tai chi and qi gong (pronounced CHEE-gung) combine slow, deliberate movements, meditation , and breathing exercises. The routines were not designed to burn calories or raise your heart rate . Instead, both tai chi and qi gong are martial arts that can help your circulation, balance, and alignment. They can also help restore your energy, called chi or qi (pronounced ""chee""). The low-impact moving meditations include standing and balancing. Although qi gong and tai chi are excellent fitness activities for beginners and people with health conditions, elite athletes also benefit from doing the slow movements, because everyone needs better balance and muscle control. The postures flow together without pause, making qi gong and tai chi look like slow, graceful dances that keep your body in constant motion. You can take a class or do the exercises outdoors, on your own, or with a group.', 'Intensity Level: Low The moving meditation is a very low-impact exercise that puts minimal stress on joints and muscles.', ""Areas It Targets Core: Yes. You won't be doing moves like crunches, but you'll be using your core muscles as you flow from move to move. Arms: Yes. Your arms are part of the movements in these gentle martial arts. Legs: Yes. You do the movements standing up, so tai chi and qi gong do use your leg muscles, but not in an intense way. Glutes: Yes. The exercises don’t include positions that specifically target the glutes, but those muscles will be working as you move. Back: Yes. Tai chi and qi gong use your whole body, including the muscles in your back."", ""Type Flexibility: Yes. The movements help improve flexibility. Aerobic: No. These are moving meditations, not cardio workouts . Strength: Yes. When you do qi gong and tai chi, you're building strength in a subtle way. Your body weight is all you need. It's not about powering through muscular poses, but about engaging your whole body. Sport: No. It is not a sport. Low-Impact: Yes. The gentle movements put minimal stress on the muscles and joints."", 'What Else You Should Know Cost: Yes. The costs are minimal. To learn the movements, it’s best to sign up for a class or follow a DVD. Good for Beginners: Both qi gong and tai chi are excellent practices for beginners. Outdoors: Yes. Classes can be held indoors or outdoors. At Home: Yes. The moving meditations can be done at home. Equipment: None is required.', ""What Melinda Ratini, MD, Says: Qi gong and tai chi are relaxing ways to improve your flexibility and balance. Both are great ways to stay active and vital. The gentle, flowing movements are easy on the joints. But check with your doctor first if you have any conditions such as diabetes or circulation problems, or if you take any medications that can make you dizzy when you change positions. Most people will also need to do some aerobic exercise, like walking, as well as additional strength building. Check with your doctor to see what type of well-rounded program is right for you. These aren't heart -pumping workouts. But even seasoned athletes have much to gain from a meditative, deliberate approach to movement. Is It Good for Me if I Have a Health Condition? One of the best features of tai chi and qi gong is that they can be adapted to fit just about any fitness level. The gentle flowing low-impact movements are easy on your joints if you have arthritis . You can even do them seated or in a wheelchair if needed. But if you have medical issues or an injury or have recently had surgery, check with your doctor before increasing your activity. When you are pregnant , you can gain many benefits from meditative movements like tai chi and qi gong. They can increase your flexibility and improve your balance. Both activities are low-impact, so they are not going to put your joints at risk. If you have high blood pressure , some studies have shown that tai chi can help lower your blood pressure . Other research points to a drop in cholesterol levels as well. That helps lower your chances of heart disease . It may even increase your fitness level. Check with your doctor first if you have heart disease or if you take blood pressure medicine. Some blood pressure medicines can make you feel dizzy when you bend over or do certain other moves. Tai chi and qi gong can also be great ways to gently get you back into moving around if you have diabetes and have been inactive. Depending on your fitness level, your doctor will likely also suggest some cardio and more moderate activity to help manage your diabetes.""]"
2,Arthritis and Takayasu's Arteritis,"['What Is Arteritis? Arteritis is a general term that refers to the inflammation of arteries -- blood vessels that carry blood away from the heart and to the rest of the body. A closely related condition called vasculitis is inflammation of blood vessels in general -- including veins and arteries.', ""What Is Takayasu's Arteritis? Takayasu's arteritis is an uncommon condition in which inflammation damages large and medium-sized arteries. The arteries most commonly affected are the branches of the aorta (the main blood vessel that leaves the heart), including the blood vessels that supply blood to the arms and travel through the neck to provide blood to the brain . The aorta itself is also often affected. Less commonly, arteries that provide blood to the heart, intestines , kidneys , and legs may be involved. Inflammation of large blood vessels may cause segments of the vessels to weaken and stretch, resulting in an aneurysm (bulging blood vessel). Vessels also can become narrowed or even completely blocked (called an occlusion). Takayasu's arteritis was named for Dr. Mikoto Takayasu, the doctor who first described the disorder in 1908."", ""What Are the Symptoms of Takayasu's Arteritis? Approximately half of all people with Takayasu's arteritis will have a sense of generalized illness. This may include low grade fevers , swollen glands , anemia , dizziness , night sweats , muscle aches, and/or arthritis. The changes that occur in Takayasu's arteritis are often gradual, allowing alternate (collateral) routes of blood flow to develop. These alternate routes are typically smaller blood vessels. The collateral vessels may not be able to carry as much blood as the normal vessels. In general, however, the blood flow that occurs beyond an area of narrowing is almost always adequate to allow tissues to survive. In rare cases, if collateral blood vessels are not available in sufficient quantity, the tissue that is normally supplied with blood and oxygen by those vessels will die. Narrowing of blood vessels to the arms or legs may cause fatigue , pain, or aching due to reduced blood supply -- especially during activities such as shampooing the hair , exercising, or walking. It is much less common for decreased blood flow to cause a stroke or a heart attack . In some people, decreased blood flow to the intestines may lead to abdominal pain , especially after meals."", ""Decreased blood flow to the kidneys may cause high blood pressure , but rarely causes kidney failure. Some people with Takayasu's arteritis may not have any symptoms. Their diagnosis may be discovered when their doctor attempts to take their blood pressure and has trouble getting a reading in one or both arms. Similarly, a doctor may notice that the strength of pulses in the wrists, neck, or groin may not be equal, or the pulse on one side may be absent."", ""What Causes Takayasu's Arteritis? The exact cause of Takayasu's arteritis is unknown."", ""Who Gets Takayasu's Arteritis? Takayasu's arteritis most often affects young Asian women, but it also can affect children and adults of all ages and ethnic backgrounds. At diagnosis, Takayasu's arteritis patients often are between the ages of 15 and 35. Every year in the U.S., two to three people are diagnosed with Takayasu's arteritis for every one million Americans."", 'How Is Takayasu\'s Arteritis Diagnosed? The diagnosis of Takayasu\'s arteritis is based on a combination of factors, including: A complete medical history and careful physical exam to exclude other illnesses that may have similar symptoms Imaging studies (such as MRI, X-rays, and angiograms), which show location and severity of vessel damage Presence of a bruit. Significant narrowing of blood vessels may result in turbulent blood flow through the narrowed area that creates an unusual sound called a ""bruit."" Note: With most other forms of vasculitis, a biopsy (tissue sample) of the affected area confirms the presence of blood vessel inflammation. A biopsy is most appropriate when easily accessible areas, such as the skin , are affected. However, when large blood vessels are affected, a biopsy is often not practical because of the risks associated with surgery.', 'How Is Takayasu\'s Arteritis Treated? Corticosteroids -- often called simply ""steroids"" -- are the most common treatment for Takayasu\'s arteritis. Steroids work within hours after the first dose is given. While this drug often is dramatically effective, it may be only partially effective for some people. Once it is apparent that the disease is under control, doctors slowly reduce the dosage of prednisone (a steroid) to sustain improvement, thereby trying to minimize treatment side effects. In some people, it is possible to gradually discontinue medication without a relapse.', ""As the dosage of prednisone is gradually reduced, about half of all patients will have recurrent symptoms or progression of illness. This has led researchers to explore additional treatments to produce remission. Among medications that have been tried, with varying degrees of success, are immunosuppressive drugs such as methotrexate . When these drugs are added to prednisone to treat Takayasu's arteritis, 50% of patients who had previously relapsed will achieve remission and be able to gradually discontinue prednisone. Overall, about 25% of patients will have a disease that is not entirely controlled without continued use of these treatments. This emphasizes the need for continuing research to identify better and less toxic treatments for Takayasu's arteritis and other forms of vasculitis ."", 'Many patients with Takayasu\'s arteritis have high blood pressure. Careful control of blood pressure is very important. Inadequate treatment of high blood pressure may result in stroke , heart disease, or kidney failure. In some cases, it is desirable to stretch narrow vessel openings with a balloon (a technique known as "" angioplasty "") or to do a bypass operation to restore normal flow to the kidney. This may result in normal blood pressure without the need to use blood pressure drugs . Some patients may have serious disabilities because of narrowed blood vessels that supply other sites, such as the arms or legs. Bypass operations may correct these abnormalities. Aneurysms also can be surgically repaired.', ""What Is the Outlook For People With Takayasu's Arteritis? In the U.S. and Japan, Takayasu's arteritis is fatal in only about 3% of patients who have had the disease for an average of five years. This encouraging statistic is the product of recognizing the disease and treating it appropriately. Reports from other parts of the world have been less optimistic, possibly because it is not as readily recognized and treated."", ""Will People With Takayasu's Arteritis Be Able to Live Normal Lives? Approximately 25% of patients with Takayasu's arteritis seen at The Cleveland Clinic have an entirely normal lifestyle. Another 25% have had to make some adjustments in their activities. About half have had to modify their jobs and a small number of that group became occupationally disabled. Takayasu's arteritis is clearly a treatable disease and most patients improve. However, it is apparent that many patients have to deal with consequences of this illness that may be partially or, less often, completely disabling. Close follow-up is required as drugs used to treat the disease have side effects that should be regularly monitored by a doctor.""]"
3,Talking to Your Kids About Sex,"[""Sex is an important part of being human. It involves more than the physical act of intercourse with another person. It affects how we feel about ourselves as males and females and impacts important choices we make as men and women. What you think about sex may seem clear and straightforward. But when it comes to laying the groundwork to help your kids develop a healthy understanding of sex, having that conversation can feel overwhelming. When your child is in middle school (if not earlier), you’re bound to start getting questions, which they’re probably also discussing with their friends. And since they're going to be gathering information, it’s best that it's accurate and that it comes from you."", 'Why Should I Talk to My Kids About Sex? The question should be, why shouldn’t you? Talking with your child about sex is important to help him or her develop healthy attitudes toward sex and to learn responsible sexual behavior. Openly discussing sex with your child will enable you to provide accurate information. What they learn elsewhere might not be true and might not reflect the personal and moral values and principles you want your children to follow. You need your preteen or teen to understand the possible consequences of being sexually active -- including pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases, and all of the emotional trappings that come with being part of a sexual relationship .', ""If I Talk to My Kids About Sex, Won't That Just Make Them Want to Do It? It's important for children to understand sexual feelings and relationships before they become sexually active. Studies show that teens who have discussed sex with their parents are more likely to wait longer to begin having sex and more likely to use contraception when they do."", 'What Do I Say? Focus on the facts about sex. Consider using the following list of topics as a guide: Explanation of anatomy and reproduction in males and females Sexual intercourse and pregnancy Fertility and birth control Other forms of sexual behavior, including oral sex, masturbation , and petting Sexual orientation , including heterosexuality, homosexuality, and bisexuality The physical and emotional aspects of sex, including the differences between males and females Self-image and peer pressure Sexually transmitted diseases Rape and date rape, including putting oneself in a high-risk situation such as being intoxicated (drunk or high), accepting rides or going to private places with strangers or acquaintances, and not traveling in groups or double dating with friends How choice of clothing and the way you present yourself, including body language, sends messages to others about your interest in sexual behavior', ""How Open Should I Be When We Talk? Some parents are uncomfortable talking to their kids about sex. It may help to practice what you are going to say before you sit down with your son or daughter. Be sure to pay attention and listen to what your child says and asks. It may be helpful to have both parents present for support. Some kids may be embarrassed to talk about sex or to admit they don't know something. So they may not ask direct questions. Look for opportunities to bring up sexuality issues with your children. Opportunities may come from a scene on TV or in a movie, a book or an article, or the appearance of visible changes in your son or daughter, such as the growth of breasts or facial hair .

4,Tardive Dyskinesia,"[""Tardive dyskinesia is a side effect of antipsychotic medications . These drugs are used to treat schizophrenia and other mental health disorders. TD causes stiff, jerky movements of your face and body that you can't control. You might blink your eyes , stick out your tongue , or wave your arms without meaning to do so. Not everyone who takes an antipsychotic drug will get it. But if TD happens, it’s sometimes permanent. So if you have movements you can't control, let your doctor know right away. To ease your symptoms, your doctor may: Lower the dose Add another medication to counteract the movements Switch you to a different drug"", ""Symptoms Tardive dyskinesia causes stiff, jerky movements that you can't control. They include: Orofacial dyskinesia or oro-bucco-lingual dyskinesia : Uncontrolled movements in your face -- namely your lips, jaw, or tongue . You might: Stick out your tongue without trying Blink your eyes fast Chew Smack or pucker your lips Puff out your cheeks Frown Grunt Dyskinesia of the limbs: It can also affect your arms, legs, fingers, and toes. That can cause you to: Wiggle your fingers Tap your feet Flap your arms Thrust out your pelvis Sway from side to side These movements can be fast or slow. You may find it hard to work and stay active."", ""Causes and Risk Factors Antipsychotic meds treat schizophrenia , bipolar disorder , and other brain conditions. Doctors also call them neuroleptic drugs. They block a brain chemical called dopamine. It helps cells talk to each other and makes the muscles move smoothly. When you have too little of it, your movements can become jerky and out of control. You can get TD if you take an antipsychotic drug. Usually you have to be on it for 3 months or more. But there have been rare cases of it after a single dose of an antipsychotic medicine. Older versions of these drugs are more likely to cause this problem than newer ones. Some studies find a similar risk from both types, though. Antipsychotic medications that can cause tardive dyskinesia include antipsychotics like: Haloperidol (Haldol) Fluphenazine Risperidone (Risperdal) Olanzapine (Zyprexa) Your chances of getting TD go up the longer you take an antipsychotic medicine. Some drugs that treat nausea , reflux, and other stomach problems can also cause TD if you take them for more than 3 months. These include: Metoclopramide ( Reglan ) Prochlorperazine ( Compazine ) You're more likely to get it if you: Are a woman who has gone through menopause Are over age 55 Abuse alcohol or drugs Are African American or Asian American"", ""Diagnosis TD can be hard to diagnose. Symptoms might not appear until months or years after you start taking antipsychotic medicine. Or you might first notice the movements after you've already stopped taking the drug. The timing can make it hard to know whether the medicine caused your symptoms. Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS): If you take medicine for mental health conditions, your doctor should check you at least once a year to make sure you don't have TD. They can give you a physical exam called the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale, which will help them rate any abnormal movements. They can also do tests to find out whether you have another disorder that causes abnormal movements, like: Cerebral palsy Huntington's disease Parkinson's disease Stroke Tourette's syndrome To rule out these conditions, you may get: Blood tests Imaging scans of the brain, such as a CT or MRI scan"", 'Treatment and Prevention The goal is to prevent TD. When your doctor prescribes a new drug to treat a mental health disorder, ask about its side effects. The benefits of the drug should outweigh the risks.', ""If you have movement problems, tell your doctor but don't stop taking the drug on your own. Your doctor can take you off the medicine that caused the movements, or lower the dose. You might need to switch to a newer antipsychotic drug that may be less likely to cause TD. There are two FDA-approved medicines to treat tardive dyskinesia: Deutetrabenazine ( Austedo ) Valbenazine ( Ingrezza ) Both of these medicines work in similar ways to regulate the amount of dopamine flow in brain areas that control certain kinds of movements. Both can sometimes cause drowsiness. Austedo also has been shown to sometimes cause depression when used in patients with Huntington's disease.

Muscular dystrophy (MD) is a group of inherited diseases in which the muscles that control movement (called voluntary muscles) progressively weaken. In some forms of this disease, the heart and other organs are also affected. There are nine major forms of muscular dystrophy: Myotonic Duchenne Becker Limb-girdle Facioscapulohumeral Congenital Oculopharyngeal Distal Emery-Dreifuss Muscular dystrophy can appear in infancy up to middle age or later, and its form and severity are determined in part by the age at which it occurs. Some types of muscular dystrophy typicallyaffect only males; some people with MD enjoy a normal life span with mild symptoms that progress very slowly; others experience swift and severe muscle weakness and wasting, dying in their late teens to early 20s. The various types of MD affect more than 50,000 Americans. Through advances in medical care, children with muscular dystrophy are living longer than ever before.', ""Muscular Dystrophy Symptoms by Type Myotonic (also called MMD or Steinert's disease). The most common form of muscular dystrophy in adults, myotonic muscular dystrophy affects both men and women, and it usually appears any time from early childhood to adulthood. In rare cases, it appears in newborns (congenital MMD). The name refers to a symptom, myotonia -- prolonged spasm or stiffening of muscles after use. This symptom is usually worse in cold temperatures. The disease causes muscle weakness and also affects the central nervous system , heart , gastrointestinal tract, eyes , and hormone-producing glands. In most cases, daily living isn't restricted for many years. Those with myotonic MD have a decreased life expectancy. Duchenne. The most common form of muscular dystrophy in children, Duchenne muscular dystrophy typically affects only males. It appears between the ages of 2 and 6. The muscles decrease in size and grow weaker over time yet may appear larger. Disease progression varies, but many people with Duchenne (1 in 3,500 boys) need a wheelchair by the age of 12. In most cases, the arms, legs, and spine become progressively deformed, and there may be some cognitive impairment. Severe breathing and heart problems mark the later stages of the disease. Those with Duchenne MD usually die in their late teens or early 20s. Becker. This form is similar to Duchenne muscular dystrophy, but the disease is much milder: symptoms appear later and progress more slowly. It usually appears between the ages of 2 and 16 but can appear as late as age 25. Like Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Becker muscular dystrophy typically affects only males (1 in 30,000) and causes heart problems. Disease severity varies. Those with Becker can usually walk into their 30s and live further into adulthood. Limb-girdle. This appears in the teens to early adulthood and affects males and females. In its most common form, Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy causes progressive weakness that begins in the hips and moves to the shoulders, arms, and legs and the heart may be affected. Within 20 years, walking becomes difficult or impossible. Sufferers typically live to middle age to late adulthood. Facioscapulohumeral. Facioscapulohumeral refers to the muscles that move the face, shoulder blade, and upper arm bone . This form of muscular dystrophy appears in the teens to early adulthood and affects males and females. It progresses slowly, with short periods of rapid muscle deterioration and weakness. Severity ranges from very mild to completely disabling. Walking, chewing, swallowing, and speaking problems can occur. About 50% of those with facioscapulohumeral MD can walk throughout their lives, and most live a normal life span. It may also bee associated with seizures, mental health problems, and can involve the heart Congenital. Congenital means present at birth. Congenital muscular dystrophies progress slowly and affect males and females. The two forms that have been identified -- Fukuyama and congenital muscular dystrophy with myosin deficiency -- cause muscle weakness at birth or in the first few months of life, along with severe and early contractures (shortening or shrinking of muscles that causes joint problems). Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy causes abnormalities in the brain and often seizures . Oculopharyngeal. Oculopharyngeal means eye and throat. This form of muscular dystrophy appears in men and women in their 40s, 50s, and 60s. It progresses slowly, causing weakness in the eye and face muscles, which may lead to difficulty swallowing. Weakness in pelvic and shoulder muscles may occur later. Choking and recurrent pneumonia may occur. Distal. This group of rare diseases affects adult men and women. It causes weakness and wasting of the distal muscles (those farthest from the center) of the forearms, hands, lower legs, and feet . It is generally less severe, progresses more slowly, and affects fewer muscles than other forms of muscular dystrophy. Emery-Dreifuss. This rare form of muscular dystrophy appears from childhood to the early teens and affects mainly males. In very rare cases, females can be affected. For that to happen, both of a girls X chromosomes (the one they get from their mother and the one from their father) would have to have the defective gene. It causes muscle weakness and wasting in the shoulders, upper arms, and lower legs. Life-threatening heart problems are common and can also affect carriers -- those who have the genetic information for the disease but do not develop the full-blown version (including mothers and sisters of those with Emery-Dreifuss MD). Muscle shortening (contractures) occurs early in the disease. Weakness can spread to chest and pelvic muscles. The disease progresses slowly and causes less severe muscle weakness than some other forms of muscular dystrophy."", ""Muscular Dystrophy Causes and Risk Factors Muscular dystrophy is caused by defects in certain genes, with type determined by the abnormal gene. In 1986, researchers discovered the gene that, when defective or flawed, causes Duchenne muscular dystrophy. In 1987, the muscle protein associated with this gene was named dystrophin. Duchenne muscular dystrophy occurs when that gene fails to make dystrophin. Becker muscular dystrophy occurs when a different mutation in the same gene results in some dystrophin, but it's either not enough or it's poor in quality. Scientists have discovered and continue to search for the genetic defects that cause other forms of muscular dystrophy."", ""Most of the muscular dystrophies are a form of inherited disease called X-linked disorders or genetic diseases that mothers can transmit to their sons even though the mothers themselves are unaffected by the disease. Men carry one X chromosome and one Y chromosome. Females carry two X chromosomes. Thus, in order for a girl to become affected by muscular dystrophy, both their X chromosomes would have to carry the defective gene -- an extremely rare occurrence, since their mother would have to be a carrier (one defective X chromosome) and their father would have to have muscular dystrophy (since men carry just one X chromosome, the other is a Y chromosome). A female who carries the defective X chromosome can pass the disease to their son (whose other chromosome is a Y, from the father). A few muscular dystrophies aren't inherited at all and occur because of a new gene abnormality or mutation."", 'Muscular Dystrophy Diagnosis To start, your doctor will examine your child and ask questions about medical and family health history. Muscular dystrophy is diagnosed using several different tests. These may include:', 'Muscle biopsy . A small piece of muscle tissue is removed and examined to confirm the diagnosis or rule out another muscle disease. Genetic ( DNA ) testing. Genes passed down through families can cause some forms of muscular dystrophy. A blood test can determine if you or your child has the gene. Neurological tests. Various tests are done to check nervous system function, reflexes, and coordination. One example is a nerve conduction study, also called a nerve function test, or electromyography (EMG).', 'Enzyme tests. These are blood tests that check for proteins, or enzymes, linked to muscle weakness. People with muscular dystrophy have high levels of the enzyme creatine kinase. It’s made when muscles are damaged. They also have higher levels of serum aldolase, which is made when your body breaks down sugar into energy. Heart monitoring. An electrocardiogram may be done to check for an abnormal heartbeat . Some types of muscular dystrophy cause irregular heartbeats. MRI or ultrasound . These imaging tests give the doctor a look at muscle quality and can reveal if fat is replacing muscle tissue.', 'Muscular Dystrophy Treatment There is no cure for muscular dystrophy, but treatments can help manage symptoms and improve quality of life. Medications Prescription drugs are available to control muscular dystrophy symptoms or slow their progression. Medications for muscular dystrophy include: Steroids . Corticosteroids, such as prednisone and deflazacort (Emflaza), are the standard of care for muscular dystrophy. They help improve muscle strength and breathing and decrease weakness. Side effects include high blood pressure and weight gain . People who use steroids for a long time are at risk for brittle bones. Medicines targeting gene mutations. Eteplirsen (Exondys 51) and golodirsen (Vyondys 53) increase the level of the gene dystrophin. They’re approved to specifically treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Anticonvulsants. Often used to treat epilepsy , these antiseizure drugs may also help reduce muscle spasms . Immunosuppressants. These powerful medicines are often used to treat lupus and other autoimmune diseases . When given to people with muscular dystrophy, they may help prevent some muscle cell damage. Antibiotics. The doctor may prescribe an antibiotic to treat a lung infection, which is common in people with muscular dystrophy.', 'Physical therapy Physical therapy helps keep joints and muscles flexible. It’s an important part of a muscular dystrophy treatment plan. The goal of physical therapy is to improve strength in the large muscle groups and prevent scoliosis and contractures. Physical therapy for muscular dystrophy may involve: Range of motion exercises Stretching Low-impact workouts, such as swimming or water exercise (aquatic therapy)', 'Respiratory care Muscle weakness can affect the lungs, making breathing difficult. A respiratory therapist can teach you and your child how to properly use a mask, nose device, or mouthpiece. Mobility and positioning aids Braces, walkers, or wheelchairs help provide mobility and independence to people with muscular dystrophy. Standing with a walker, even for just a little bit each day, boosts blood flow and helps build better bones. Speech therapy Muscle weakness in the face and throat can make speaking difficult. Learning how to properly pace breathing and talking can be helpful. A speech therapist can also show you how to use speech communication devices.', 'Surgery Surgery may be recommended to manage or correct complications of muscular dystrophy. For example, cataract surgery may be done to replace a cloudy eye lens. Or a person with muscular dystrophy may need spinal fusion surgery to treat scoliosis, or heart surgery to implant a pacemaker .', 'Muscular Dystrophy Complications The complications of muscular dystrophy depend on the type. Some types are mild, while others are serious and get worse very fast. Worsening muscle weakness can affect the ability to walk, breathe, swallow, and speak. Complications of muscular dystrophy can include: Breathing problems . Progressive weakness in the breathing muscles (diaphragm) makes it hard to take a breath. That raises the risk for lung infections such as pneumonia. Curving of the spine (scoliosis). Weakness in the muscles supporting the backbone causes the spine to become curved. Most people with Duchenne muscular dystrophy need scoliosis surgery. Heart problems. Some types of muscular dystrophy cause abnormal and dangerous changes in the heartbeat. You need a pacemaker to regulate it. Muscular dystrophy can also cause the heart muscle to become weak ( cardiomyopathy ). That leads to heart failure .', 'Swallowing difficulty. Weakness affects the muscles in the esophagus , and causes problems with chewing and swallowing. This can lead to choking. Some people with muscular dystrophy will need a feeding tube . Shortening of the tendons or muscles around the joints (contractures). Bracing and tendon release surgery can help prevent some contractures. Vision problems. Some types of muscular dystrophy cause clouding of the eye lens ( cataracts ). Need for a wheelchair. Weakness in the large muscles of the legs makes it difficult to walk, stand, kneel, or climb. Some people with muscular dystrophy eventually need to use a wheelchair.']"
6,"Chalazion: Causes, Symptoms, and Treatment","['What Is a Chalazion? A chalazion is a small swelling or lump on your eyelid caused by a blocked gland. They’re called chalazia if you have more than one. A chalazion is one of the most common types of eyelid lumps. Chalazia are most likely to happen on your upper eyelid. However, you can get them on both eyes at once. Chalazia often go away and come back. Chalazion vs. stye It can be hard to tell a chalazion from a stye, another kind of eyelid bump that’s caused by an infection. Styes happen along the edge of your eyelid, sometimes in the base of an eyelash, but chalazia are usually toward the middle of the lid. A stye is more likely to be painful. It also tends to have a yellowish spot at the center that may burst after a few days. A stye can become a chalazion if the infection goes away and leaves some material stuck in the gland. Most chalazia go away on their own, but see a doctor if you have one that lingers for more than a month. (Photo credit: Ipb/Dreamstime)', 'Chalazion Symptoms A chalazion starts with a small area that may be red, swollen, sore, or painful when touched. After a few days, the pain usually goes away, and a bump or lump remains. You may also have: Watery eyes Mild eye irritation Blurry vision How long does a chalazion last? A chalazion usually doesn’t stay for long. With some care at home, your chalazion will likely be gone within a week. Even if you don’t do anything, it should still go away in about 4-6 weeks. But if you’re worried your chalazion isn’t going away or it’s bothering you, talk with your doctor.', 'Chalazion Causes You have glands throughout your body. They make things that are essential for your cells, tissues, and organs to work properly. The meibomian glands in your upper and lower eyelids make oil that mixes with your tears to moisten and protect your eyes. If the oil gets too thick or if the glands are blocked because of inflammation, you may get a chalazion. Sometimes chalazia are related to or caused by other health conditions. These include: Rosacea Eyelid inflammation (blepharitis) Seborrheic dermatitis Tuberculosis Viral infections Rarely, an infection can cause a chalazion.', 'Chalazion Risk Factors Chalazia happen more often in adults than children. They might be more likely if you have: Eyelid inflammation (blepharitis) A skin condition such as seborrheic dermatitis or acne rosacea Another health condition such as diabetes Had a chalazion before', 'Chalazion Diagnosis There are no special tests for chalazia. Your doctor will probably ask about your symptoms, past eye problems , and your health history in general. If you get chalazia more than once, your doctor may recommend that you see an eye specialist such as an ophthalmologist or optometrist. They’ll want to check for other eye problems by performing an external eye exam and an eyelid exam to check the oil glands at the base of your eyelashes. Treating eye conditions such as blepharitis and meibomian gland dysfunction can keep chalazia from coming back. Will a hardened chalazion go away? The short answer is yes. It’s normal for your chalazion to feel hard. They happen when oil gets blocked and hardens. Most of the time, they’ll go away on their own. You can also take steps to soften the hardened oil and help the bump go away faster. In rare cases, you may need your doctor to remove it.', 'Chalazion Treatment Chalazia often go away in days or weeks without treatment. But certain things might speed up the process. Medical treatment See your doctor if you think you have a chalazion. They may want to check it and tell you how to take care of it to help it heal. They can also suggest certain eye drops or creams to use. If other treatments don’t work, your doctor can prescribe medicines or steroid injections to help clear up the problem. In severe cases, they might need to numb the area and cut it open to drain it. Home remedies One remedy is to apply warm, moist heat to the chalazion with a clean washcloth. Your doctor or nurse can give you instructions about how often to do it and for how long. It might also help clean your eyelids with a mild soap, such as baby shampoo or over-the-counter eyelid scrubs.', 'Gently massage the area to help open the gland. But never try to squeeze or pop a chalazion. That might make the problem worse.', 'Chalazion removal If your chalazion doesn’t go away or it gets bigger, you might want to think about surgery to remove it. Most people won’t need surgery. But if you’ve had your chalazion for more than a couple of months or if it’s growing in size, check with your doctor to see if you should have it removed. Chalazion surgery Chalazion surgery doesn’t take long. Your doctor can likely do it in the office in about 15-20 minutes. First, they’ll numb your eyelid. Then they’ll make a tiny cut in your chalazion, which will allow any fluid to drain. Your doctor can also remove the hardened oil inside your eyelid. You might have some soreness, but you won’t usually need any stitches. Your doctor might put a patch on your eye. You may use an antibiotic cream or antibiotic eye drops to make sure the incision doesn’t get infected. Other than that, you can go about your normal activities right away after surgery.', 'Ask your doctor before surgery if they will remove your chalazion from under your eyelid to avoid a scar. Doctors can often remove chalazia this way. If they have to remove it from the outside, you might end up with a small scar. Chalazion drainage Chalazia usually go away on their own. But if yours doesn’t, your doctor might want to make a small incision or cut in the bump. By opening your chalazion up, any fluid inside it can drain out.', 'Chalazion Healing Stages A chalazion will start out small. You might not even notice it at first. It may look like a little, red, or swollen spot on your eyelid. After several days, or perhaps a week, you might see that it looks bigger. At this stage, it shouldn’t hurt, but it will be easy for you and others to see. A chalazion can grow quickly to about the size of a pea. Usually, they’ll stop growing on their own. Most chalazia will clear up and heal in a matter of weeks.', 'Chalazion Prevention There’s no sure way to prevent chalazia. You can lower your odds of getting them by keeping your eyelids clean: Wash your hands often, especially before touching your eyes and handling contact lenses. Wash your eyelids before you go to bed to remove makeup and other things that can clog your glands. Replace your eye makeup every 2 or 3 months. Don’t share makeup with anyone else. If you wear contact lenses, make sure to clean them well with a disinfecting lens cleaning solution. If your contacts are disposable, make sure you only wear them for the recommended amount of time. Ask your doctor if you should carefully scrub your eyelids as part of your normal routine, especially if you’ve had a chalazion more than once.', 'When to Call a Doctor If your chalazion isn’t going away as expected with steps you’re taking at home, see an eye doctor for advice. Your doctor may suggest other steps. They can tell you if you should have your chalazion drained or removed with surgery. Let your doctor know if your chalazion goes away and then comes back.', ""Chalazion Takeaways A chalazion is a small, red bump that can form when oil glands on your eyelid get clogged. Most of the time, chalazia will go away on their own. If you have a chalazion that doesn't heal within 4-6 weeks, talk to your doctor. Never try to pop it on your own."", 'Chalazion FAQs What triggers a chalazion? A chalazion is a type of cyst. It forms when an oil gland in your eyelid gets blocked. As your blocked gland fills with fluid and oil, it makes a hard lump. When should I be worried about a chalazion? It might bother you to have a bump on your eyelid. But a chalazion isn’t something you need to worry a lot about. A chalazion most often will go away on its own or with easy home care. If you have concerns or your chalazion isn’t going away after about a month, be sure to talk with your doctor. Will a chalazion burst? Your chalazion isn’t likely to burst on its own. You also should never try to squeeze or pop it. Popping a chalazion could damage your eyelid and make infection more likely. If you have a chalazion that isn’t going away on its own, ask your doctor if you should take other steps or think about surgery.']"
7,Tay-Sachs Disease,"['What Is Tay-Sachs Disease? Tay-Sachs disease is a rare, fatal disorder most commonly diagnosed in babies around 6 months of age. There’s no cure for the disease, but scientists have a good idea of what causes it, how it worsens, and how to use genetic testing to screen for it early in pregnancy . Researchers are working to make advances in gene\xa0therapy or bone marrow transplants that they hope will allow treatment of Tay-Sachs in the future', 'Tay-Sachs Disease Symptoms A baby born with Tay-Sachs grows like they should until 3 to 6 months of age. Around this time, parents might notice that their baby ’s development starts to slow and their muscles weaken. Over time, the disease causes more symptoms in babies, including: A loss of motor skills such as turning over, sitting, and crawling A very strong reaction to loud noises Trouble focusing on objects or following them with their eyes Cherry-red spots, which can be identified with an eye exam, in the eyes', 'By age 2, most children with Tay-Sachs have started getting more serious problems. They can include: Swallowing and breathing issues that keep getting worse Seizures Loss of mental function, hearing, and sight Paralysis Past age 3, there are few visible changes in children with Tay-Sachs, but their nervous system continues to get worse, often leading to death by age 5.', 'Tay-Sachs Disease Causes and Risk Factors Defects in a gene called HEXA cause Tay-Sachs. (You can think of genes as “coding” that your parents pass along to you. Genes are in your cells, and they set your body’s traits -- everything from your eye color and blood type to your sex.) Most people have two healthy versions of this HEXA gene, which gives instructions to your body to make an enzyme (a type of protein ) known as Hex-A. This enzyme prevents the buildup of a fatty substance called GM2 ganglioside in your brain and spinal cord. Some people have just one healthy copy of the gene, and they still make enough Hex-A protein\xa0to keep the brain and spinal cord healthy. But babies born with Tay-Sachs disease got a changed copy of the gene from both parents, so they don’t make any Hex-A\xa0protein. This is what makes them so sick.', 'Over time, GM2 ganglioside builds up\xa0in their nervous system and starts to cause damage. The disease is very rare. It affects only about 1 in every 112,000 live births. Anyone can be a carrier of a HEXA mutation, meaning they have just one defective copy of the HEXA gene. But the chance of inheriting the disease is higher in certain groups because of a higher rate of carriers. About 1 in every 27 Jewish people in the United States is a carrier. Non-Jewish French Canadians living near the St. Lawrence River in Canada and in the Cajun community of Louisiana also have a higher incidence of Tay-Sachs. If both parents are carriers of Tay-Sachs disease, there is a 25% chance that any child they have will get the disease.', 'Tay-Sachs Disease Diagnosis Pregnant women can have a test to find out whether their unborn babies have the problem that causes Tay-Sachs. If the tests don’t find any Hex-A protein, the baby has Tay-Sachs. If the tests find Hex-A, the baby doesn’t have the disease.', 'These tests include: Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) . Your doctor takes a\xa0 small sample of the placenta with a needle or small tube and analyzes it. They can do this between the 10th and 12th weeks of pregnancy. Amniocentesis . The doctor uses a needle to take a sample of the amniotic fluid that surrounds the baby and tests it. To diagnose Tay-Sachs in a baby after it’s born: Your doctor will ask you about your baby’s symptoms and your family history. They’ll do a blood test to check Hex-A levels. The doctor will check the baby’s eyes. A cherry-red spot in the back of the eyes is a sign of Tay-Sachs. If it’s there, you may need to take your baby to specialists, such as a pediatric neurologist and an opthalmologist, for more tests.', 'Tay-Sachs Disease Treatment Some of the specialists, treatments, and programs you might consider include: Speech-language pathologists . They can provide ways to help your baby keep the suck-swallow reflex going as well as help you figure out when it is time to consider a feeding tube for your little one. Neurologists . These specialists can help you manage your baby ’s seizures with medication . Respiratory health . Specialists such as pediatricians and pulmonologists (doctors who treat lung and breathing problems ) can recommend ways for parents to lower their child’s chance of lung infections. Chest physiotherapy (CPT) . Therapy to tap on the chest wall can help break up mucus in the lungs so your child can cough it up. Feeding tubes . Your child may have trouble swallowing or may have breathing problems that include inhaling food or liquid into their lungs while eating. You can insert a feeding tube through your child’s nose into their stomach each time. Or a doctor may put in a tube during surgery. Play and stimulation . You can help your child interact with the world through music , scents, and textures. Massages . These can relax your baby. Palliative and hospice care .\xa0These programs help manage quality of life for children with Tay-Sachs and their families.', 'Tay-Sachs Disease Prevention You can have a blood\xa0test that analyzes your genes or the levels of the Hex-A protein in your blood to tell you whether you are a Tay-Sachs carrier. If two people planning to have children find out that they’re both carriers, a genetic counselor can help them review the options for lowering the chances of having a baby with Tay-Sachs.', ""Late-Onset Tay-Sachs Disease An even rarer type of Tay-Sachs is called “late onset” or “adult onset.” It can be hard to diagnose. Like the version of the disease that affects infants, Tay-Sachs that starts later in life is caused by changes in the HEXA gene. Symptoms might start to appear anywhere from the teen years to adulthood. Early symptoms often include clumsiness, trouble balancing, and muscle weakness in the legs. People with it may also have mental health issues. This form of the disease affects each person differently. Late-onset Tay-Sachs doesn't\xa0always mean a shorter life span.""]"
8,"Tuberculosis (TB): Causes, Symptoms, Treatment","[""What Is Tuberculosis? Tuberculosis\xa0(TB) is a contagious infection that usually attacks your\xa0lungs. It can also spread to other parts of your body, like your\xa0brain\xa0and\xa0spine. A type of bacteria called Mycobacterium tuberculosis causes it. This bacteria is thought to be over 3 million years old. Knowledge of the disease dates back to ancient Greece and Rome. Tuberculosis, formerly called consumption, was the top cause of death in the U.S. at the beginning of the 20th century. While it's largely controlled in the U.S. now, it still kills more than a million people worldwide every year. People with HIV/AIDS and others with weakened immune systems are at higher risk of getting tuberculosis because their bodies have a harder time fighting the bacteria. The bacterium that causes tuberculosis, called Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Photo Credit: KATERYNA KON / SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY / Getty Images"", ""Tuberculosis Types A TB infection doesn’t always mean you’ll get sick. There are several stages and forms of the disease: Primary TB. This is the first stage of a tuberculosis infection. Your immune system may be able to fight off the germs. But sometimes it doesn't destroy all of them, and they keep multiplying. You may not have any TB symptoms at this stage, or you might have a few flu-like symptoms. Latent TB. You have the germs in your body, but your\xa0immune system\xa0keeps them from spreading. You don’t have any symptoms, and you’re not contagious. But the infection is still alive and can one day become active. If you’re at high risk for reactivation, your doctor will give you medications to prevent active TB. This usually happens if you have HIV , you had an infection in the past 2 years, your chest X-ray is unusual, or your immune system is weakened. Active TB. The germs multiply and make you sick. You can spread the disease to others. Some 90% of active cases in adults come from a latent TB infection. Active TB outside the lungs. A tuberculosis infection that spreads from your lungs to other parts of the body is known as extrapulmonary tuberculosis. Your symptoms will depend on which part of your body the infection affects. A latent or active TB infection can also be drug-resistant , meaning certain medications don’t work against the bacteria."", ""Tuberculosis Symptoms Latent TB doesn’t have symptoms.

Tuberculosis testing There are two common tests for tuberculosis : Tuberculosis skin testing. This is also known as the Mantoux tuberculin skin test. A technician injects a small amount of fluid into the skin of your lower arm. After 2-3 days, they’ll check for swelling in your arm. You might get this test more than once. Tuberculosis blood testing. These tests, also called interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs), measure the response when TB proteins are mixed with a small amount of your blood. Tuberculosis test results If your skin test results are positive, you most likely have TB bacteria. But you could also get a false positive. If you’ve gotten a tuberculosis vaccine called Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), the test could say you have TB when you really don’t. You can also get a false negative, saying that you don’t have TB when you really do, if your infection is very new. Skin and blood tests can't show whether your infection is latent or active. To figure that out, your doctor can do: A chest X-ray or CT scan to look for changes in your lungs Acid-fast bacillus (AFB) tests for TB bacteria in your sputum, the mucus that comes up when you cough"", 'Tuberculosis Treatment Is there a cure for tuberculosis? Most cases are cured with\xa0antibiotics. But it takes a long time. You have to take medications for at least 6 to 9 months. How is tuberculosis treated? Your treatment will depend on your infection. If you have latent TB , your doctor will give you medication to kill the bacteria so the infection doesn’t become active. You might get isoniazid, rifampin, or rifapentine either alone or combined. You’ll have to take the drugs for 3 months or more. If you see any signs of active TB, call your doctor right away. A combination of medicines also treats active TB . The most common are ethambutol, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and rifampin. You’ll take them for 6 to 12 months. If you have drug-resistant TB , your doctor might give you one or more different medicines. You may have to take them for much longer, up to 30 months, and they can cause more side effects. Drug-resistant TB', 'Some strains of TB are resistant to antibiotics. Bacteria become drug-resistant because of changes to their genetic makeup. That can happen randomly. But when antibiotics are overprescribed or used incorrectly, this speeds up the process. Whatever kind of infection you have, it’s important to finish taking all of your medications, even when you start feeling better. If you quit too soon, the medication might not wipe out all the TB bacteria in your body.

If you have a latent infection, take all your medication so it doesn’t become active and contagious. If you have active TB, you'll need to take care to protect others from infection during your first few weeks of treatment: Limit contact with other people. If you live with others, sleep in a separate room and isolate yourself as much as possible. Cover your mouth when you laugh, sneeze, or cough. Wear a surgical mask when you’re around other people. Keep your space ventilated. Open windows, if possible, and use a fan. Germs spread more easily in poorly ventilated places."", 'Tuberculosis vaccine Children in countries where TB is common often get the BCG vaccine. It isn’t widely used in the U.S., and it doesn’t always protect against infection. Doctors recommend it only for children living with someone who has an active TB infection with a very drug-resistant strain or who can’t take antibiotics.', 'Tuberculosis Outlook Your outlook depends on several things, including your overall health, how serious the infection is, and how well you follow your doctor’s directions on treatment.

9,Meningitis,"['What Is Meningitis? Meningitis is a rare infection that affects the delicate membranes -- called meninges -- that cover the brain and spinal cord. You or your children can catch it. Meningitis vs. encephalitis These two conditions are similar, and many symptoms overlap. While meningitis affects the covering of the brain and spinal cord, encephalitis affects the tissue of the brain itself.', 'Types of Meningitis Bacterial meningitis This is an extremely serious illness. You or your child will need to get medical help right away. It can be life-threatening or lead to brain damage unless you get quick treatment. Several kinds of bacteria can cause bacterial meningitis. The most common ones in the U.S. are: Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) Neisseria meningitidis (meningococcus) Listeria monocytogenes (in older people, pregnant women, or those with immune system problems) A bacteria called Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) was a common cause of meningitis in babies and young children until the Hib vaccine became available for infants. There are also vaccines for Neisseria meningitidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Experts recommend that all children get them, as well as all adults who are at a higher risk for the disease.', ""In many cases, bacterial meningitis starts when bacteria get into your bloodstream from your sinuses , ears , or throat. The bacteria travel through your bloodstream to your brain. The bacteria that cause meningitis can spread when people who are infected cough or sneeze . If you or your child has been around someone who has bacterial meningitis, ask your doctor what steps you should take to avoid catching it. Viral meningitis Viral meningitis is more common than the bacterial form and generally less serious, but this isn't always the case. Several viruses can trigger the disease. Among them are: Non-polio enteroviruses, including the one that causes hand, foot, and mouth disease Herpes simplex virus Varicella zoster, which also causes chickenpox and shingles Mumps virus Measles virus Arboviruses such as West Nile and Zika Epstein-Barr, which also causes mononucleosis HIV Flu viruses Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus Fungal meningitis Fungal meningitis is much less common than the bacterial or viral forms. Healthy people rarely get it. You’re more likely to get this form of meningitis if you have a problem with your immune system, such as AIDS . Among the fungi that cause it are: Cryptococcus , which is common everywhere in the world. Histoplasma, which is especially common in soil with lots of bird or bat poop. In the U.S., it's found mostly in eastern and central states. Blastomyces, which thrives in wet soil and decaying leaves. In the U.S., it's found mostly in midwestern, south-central, and southeastern states. Coccidioides, which is found in the soil in the southwestern U.S., Mexico, Central and South America, and some parts of Washington state."", ""Parasitic meningitis Parasitic meningitis is also rare. It’s caused by parasites that usually affect animals. You can get it from eating animals such as snails, slugs, snakes, fish , or poultry that are infected by parasites or their eggs, or produce that contains parasite eggs. The risk is higher with raw or undercooked foods. You can’t pass on this type of meningitis to other people. One especially rare type of this is called eosinophilic meningitis, and it's linked to three specific parasites: Angiostrongylus cantonensis , also known as rat lungworm, is found in Southeast Asia, Pacific islands, the Caribbean, and Africa. Baylisascaris procyonis is a type of roundworm that affects raccoons. It can also infect other small animals, including dogs. Gnathostoma spinigerum is a parasitic worm found mostly in Asia, South and Central America, and some parts of Africa. Amoebic meningitis Amoebic meningitis is a rare but usually fatal infection by a single-celled bug called Naegleria fowleri . This amoeba lives in soil or warm, fresh water, but not salt water. People typically get it from swimming in water where the amoeba lives, not by drinking it. Amoebic meningitis isn’t contagious."", ""Noninfectious meningitis Noninfectious meningitis is caused by diseases such as lupus or cancer , or it may happen if you’ve had a head injury , brain surgery, or take certain medications . It isn’t contagious. Chronic meningitis Chronic meningitis has similar symptoms as acute meningitis but develops over a couple of weeks. It results from infections with a fungus or the mycobacteria that cause tuberculosis . These organisms get into the tissue and fluid surrounding your brain to cause meningitis. Aseptic meningitis is a term doctors use when they can't find signs of bacteria in fluid from your brain and spine. That might mean your meningitis has another cause, such as a virus, or it might mean the bacteria making you sick is hard to grow in lab conditions."", 'Meningitis Symptoms Meningitis can cause a rash that starts small and looks like pinpricks before spreading into red or purple splotches. It can be hard to spot if your skin tone is darker – check the palms of your hands and the soles of your feet.

Signs to watch for include: Confusion Fever Headache Numbness in your face Sensitivity to light Stiff neck so that you can’t lower your chin to your chest Upset stomach or vomiting Severe headache with nausea or vomiting A hard time concentrating Seizures Sleepiness or a hard time waking up Lack of appetite Lack of thirst', 'What\'s the first sign of meningitis? In the early stages of meningitis, you might feel like you have the flu. Meningitis in babies In infants, meningitis symptoms may include: High fever Crying that’s constant and gets louder when you hold the baby Baby seems overly sleepy, sluggish, or inactive Stiff neck or body Bulge on the soft area on the top of the baby ’s head Poor ability to feed Crankiness Meningitis in children The symptoms of meningitis in children older than 2 are the same as they are in adults. Meningitis rash Meningococcal bacteria is the main cause of the signature meningitis rash. As the bacteria spread through your body, they damage blood vessels. The vessels start to leak blood, which pools into surrounding tissue and becomes visible on your skin. It may start as what\'s called a ""petechial"" rash, which looks like small, red pinpricks on your skin. You may find them in spots where clothes put pressure on the skin – the waistband, for instance.', 'A ""purpuric"" rash looks like splotches of red or purple, more like bruising. A petechial rash can progress to this stage. It can be tough to spot the rash on darker skin. Check paler areas of the body, such as the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, tummy, roof of the mouth, and insides of eyelids. If you roll a clear drinking glass over the rash, it might disappear. If it does, it\'s a ""blanching"" rash. If it doesn\'t go away, it\'s a ""non-blanching"" rash. A meningitis rash may start as blanching but almost always will progress to non-blanching. You can have meningitis without developing the rash. But the rash is a sign of serious illness, and anyone with it needs immediate medical help.', ""Risk Factors for Meningitis Anyone can get meningitis, but research shows that it's more common in these age groups: Children under 5 Teenagers and young adults aged 16-25 Adults older than 55 Meningitis is more of a danger for people with certain medical conditions, such as a damaged or missing spleen , long-term disease, or immune system disorders . Because certain germs that cause meningitis can spread easily, outbreaks are most likely to happen in places where people live close to each other. College students in dorms or military recruits in barracks can be more likely to catch the disease. So are people who travel to areas where meningitis is more common, such as parts of Africa."", ""Meningitis and Pregnancy One type of germ that causes bacterial meningitis is listeria. If you're pregnant, you're 13 times more susceptible than the general population to infection by this bacteria. It can contaminate: Hot dogs Lunch meat Paté and other meat spreads Smoked seafood Unwashed raw fruits and vegetables Unpasteurized milk Unpasteurized soft cheeses, including f eta, queso blanco, queso fresco, Brie, queso panela, Camembert, and blue-veined cheeses A listeria infection can lead to meningitis. During pregnancy, it can cause early labor or may be fatal to your baby. That's why doctors recommend avoiding foods most often affected by listeria when you're pregnant."", ""Meningitis Causes Meningitis almost always results from a bacterial or viral infection that begins somewhere else in your body, such as your ears , sinuses , or throat.

But some of the things that cause it are. Many things that cause bacterial and viral meningitis can be spread to other people."", ""Meningitis Diagnosis Your doctor will ask about your medical history and do a physical exam , including checking your neck for stiffness and looking for a skin rash that might suggest a bacterial infection. Meningitis tests If your doctor suspects meningitis, you'll need tests to confirm the diagnosis. They might include: Blood tests to find bacteria CT or MRI scans of your head to find swelling or inflammation Spinal tap, in which a health care worker uses a needle to take fluid from around your spinal cord. It can tell what’s causing your meningitis."", 'Treatment for Meningitis Your treatment will depend on the type of meningitis you have. Bacterial meningitis needs treatment with antibiotics right away. The doctor might give you a general or broad-spectrum antibiotic even before they’ve found the exact bacteria that caused your illness. Once they do, they’ll change to a drug that targets the specific bacteria they find with the spinal tap. You might also get corticosteroids to ease inflammation .', ""Viral meningitis usually goes away on its own without treatment. Your doctor might tell you to stay in bed, drink plenty of fluids, and take over-the-counter pain medicines if you have a fever or aches. If a virus such as herpes or influenza caused your illness, you might take antiviral medication. Antifungal medications can treat fungal meningitis. You might need to spend time in the hospital if you're dehydrated or have severe symptoms."", 'Complications of Meningitis Meningitis can cause severe complications in adults and children, especially if you delay treatment. Possible complications include: Seizures Brain damage or stroke Loss of hearing Memory problems Learning problems A hard time walking, or paralysis Kidney failure Shock Death', 'Prevention of Meningitis You may be able to prevent meningitis by avoiding infection with the viruses or bacteria that cause it. These infections are passed to others when you cough, sneeze , kiss, or share toothbrushes , or eating utensils. Take these steps to prevent infections: Wash your hands often. Rinse well. Also, teach your kids to wash their hands often, especially after eating, using the toilet, or when they’re in public places. Don’t share items such as toothbrushes, eating utensils, or lipstick. Don’t share food items or drinks with other people. Cover your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze. Stay healthy. Eat a healthy diet , get plenty of exercise, and rest at night.

Follow your doctor’s advice on getting immunization shots for diseases that may cause meningitis, including flu and pneumonia vaccines.', ""Meningitis Vaccines Some vaccines can help protect you from meningococcal illness, which is caused by bacteria. MenACWY vaccine, which the CDC recommends for all teens and preteens. One dose is given at the age of 11 or 12, followed by a booster at age 16. It's also recommended for adults at high risk. MenB vaccine is recommended for children 10 and older who are at increased risk MenABCWY vaccine is a combination of MenACWY and MenB. If you're planning to get the other two at the same time, you can get this vaccine instead. The pneumococcal and Hib vaccines protect against bacteria that can cause bacterial meningitis. The Bacille Calmette-Guerin vaccine protects you against tuberculosis, which can cause meningitis. But it isn't used much in the U.S."", 'Takeaways When you have meningitis, the protective layers around your brain and spinal cord (meninges) become inflamed. Most cases are caused by viruses, but other causes include bacteria, fungi, parasites, or amoeba. Common symptoms include a stiff neck, headache, fever, nausea, and vomiting.

If you have bacterial meningitis, your symptoms could get worse rapidly.', 'Meningitis FAQs Can you have meningitis without a fever? Fever is a common symptom, but not everyone with meningitis has a fever. Can a person survive meningitis? Most people survive most forms of meningitis. How well you do depends on the type you have and how quickly you receive treatment. Amoebic meningitis cases caused by Naegleria fowleri are often fatal, but these infections are also very rare. How long does meningitis last? If you have viral meningitis, your main symptoms may go away within a week. If you have bacterial or fungal meningitis, you may need more time to recover, weeks or even months. You also might have lingering effects.']"
10,What Is Treacher Collins Syndrome?,"['Treacher Collins syndrome (TCS) is a rare condition. Babies who have it are born with atypical ears , eyelids, cheek bones, and jawbones. There is no cure, but surgery can make a big difference. The condition is caused by an abnormal gene that affects how the face forms. Hearing loss is common. TCS affects about one out of every 50,000 babies born. TCS is always genetic but usually isn’t inherited. For about 60% of the children who get it, neither parent carries the gene. For them, the chances of passing it along to another child are quite low. In the other 40% of cases, the child gets it from a parent. The chances of passing it along with each pregnancy are 50%.', 'Signs and Problems The physical signs of TCS vary from child to child. Some have very mild cases that are hard to see. For others, it’s quite severe. Signs can include: Flat, sunken, or sad look to the face Too-small cheekbones Eyes that slant down Missing eyelid tissue Notch in the lower eyelid Cleft palate (an opening in the roof of the mouth ) Abnormal airway Small upper and lower jaw and chin Misshapen or missing ears Skin growth in front of the ear', 'This condition can make it hard to breathe , sleep , eat, and hear.

Some symptoms of Treacher Collins syndrome are like those of other conditions. That’s why the doctor will want to be sure. Genetic tests can show gene changes that may have caused your baby ’s TCS. The first step is to talk with a genetic counselor who will explain the test and why you may, or may not, want to have it. Your doctor can help you with this.', 'How to Treat Treacher Collins Syndrome TCS can’t be cured. And no one treatment is best for everyone who has it. That’s because each case is different. It depends on the problems your child has, or may have in the future. If your baby does have TCS, you’ll want to get their hearing checked. Deformed bones in the face can also make it hard for your child to breathe and eat. If your newborn has these problems, your doctor will have advice. Your baby might need a tube to help them breathe. Many surgeries can improve or fix the problems. Talk with your doctor about what’s best for your child and what’s the best time to take care of it. Possible operations your child might need: Nose surgery to open a blocked airway Mouth surgery for a cleft palate Repair of the eye socket Repair of the eyelid Repair of the nose Repair of the cheekbones Repair of the jawbone Surgery to reconstruct the ears', 'These require a surgeon who is a specialist in operations on the face and head. Other kinds of treatment don’t involve surgery -- hearing aids , as well as speech and language programs.

But most kids with childhood depression will suffer a very noticeable change in social activities, a loss of interest in school, poor academic performance, or a change in appearance. Children may also begin using drugs or alcohol. Or they may start smoking cigarettes, especially if they are over age\xa012. Although it's uncommon in children under age 12, some young children do attempt suicide -- and may do so impulsively when they are upset or angry. Studies show that girls are more likely to attempt suicide. But boys are more likely to actually kill themselves when they make an attempt. Children with a family history of violence, alcohol abuse, or physical or sexual abuse are at greater risk for suicide.

If your child has symptoms of depression that have lasted for at least two weeks, you should schedule a visit with their health care provider. You will want to make sure that there are no physical reasons for the symptoms. You'll also want to make sure that your child receives proper treatment. A consultation with a mental health professional that specializes in treating kids with childhood depression is also recommended. A mental health evaluation for childhood depression should include interviews with you and your child. In addition, psychological testing may be helpful for clarifying the diagnosis and making treatment recommendations. Information from teachers, friends, and classmates can be useful for showing that the symptoms of childhood depression are present during your child's various activities and are a marked change from previous behavior.

14,How to Handle a Temper Tantrum,"[""What Is a Temper Tantrum? A temper tantrum is your child's way of expressing their frustration with their limits or anger about not getting their way. During a temper tantrum, they may argue, be unwilling to do what they're told to do, and go against authority. Children younger than 4 regularly have up to nine tantrums a week. While it can be shocking to see your child become so angry, it's\xa0developmentally appropriate in toddlers. Angry outbursts are how they express the frustration they are having as a result of their rapid growth. They want to do things for themselves but don't have the skills and abilities to do so.\xa0Thankfully, your toddler's anger should start to fade as they develop the communication skills to express themselves better. Most kids will argue or be stubborn every now and then, but when anger and hostility happen often – leading to other problems with friends, at school, or at home – there may be cause for concern. While parents and caregivers can ignore tantrums in toddlers and preschoolers, it's harder to shrug them off later in life. Aggressive older children can pose a danger to others and themselves. A tantrum can happen when a young child is tired or frustrated, or during daily routines like bedtime, mealtime, or getting dressed. What's not typical is when the outburst comes out of nowhere, or is so intense that the child becomes exhausted. (Photo Credit: Alina Vasylieva/Dreamstime)"", ""What's 'Normal'?

Some of the things that can be cause for concern are: Anger or unkindness toward people, objects, or both. It's possible for a child to want to hit or kick a caregiver out of frustration once in a while. But when it happens in more than half of the child's tantrums, there could be a problem. Your child tries to injure themselves. They might try to do something\xa0like: Bite themselves Scratch\xa0themselves Bang\xa0their head against the wall Try to hurt their foot by kicking, hitting, or punching something Your child can't calm down. In other words, you have to remove them from the environment or promise them something after nearly every tantrum to settle your child down and stop the tantrum."", 'Many tantrums. From ages 1 to 4, your child can average one tantrum a day. If they happen more often, that can be cause for concern. Very long outbursts. If the tantrums usually last more than 15 minutes, that could signal another issue.', ""Causes of Temper Tantrums Some typical triggers for tantrums include: Being unable to complete a task Not having the words to express their feelings Being ill Transitions Being tired, hungry, or frustrated Wanting attention or a preferred object (toy) A child might also lash out regularly because of: ADHD Anxiety A learning disability Sensory processing issues Autism Disruptive behavior disorder, which can include a pattern of actions that interrupt daily life, could be another possible cause. This condition is more than a tantrum and can include: Fighting Cruelty Arguing Not listening to authority Two of the most common disruptive behavior disorders are oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) and conduct disorder (CD). Children with ODD may show signs of being spiteful, mean, or cruel to others. They're angry a lot and spend a lot of time arguing or not following directions. They may be more likely to have anxiety or depression as they get older."", ""Children with CD may grow up to have problems in daily life with friends or at home. Their ongoing disruptive or violent actions may include bullying , using weapons, destroying property, stealing, and lying. If you're concerned about your child's behavior, talk with your pediatrician. They may refer you to a psychiatrist or a psychologist, if needed. Early treatment can help and can focus on goals like teaching your child to deal with anger and frustration in ways that are more common."", ""Preventing Temper Tantrums Stay positive. Children need positive relationships to feel connected and learn to control their behavior . When you're dealing with an angry toddler, it can be hard to stay calm. Kids with behavior challenges can get caught in a difficult cycle. Their behavior frustrates their caregiver , who gets angry with them, which causes more anger. It can feel like you're always punishing your child. As long as they aren't being destructive, try to focus on the positive – even if it means overlooking some tantrums."", ""Make a plan. You can't prevent every tantrum, but if you think ahead, you can reduce how many your child may have. Here are some tips to help: Plan ahead. Don't run errands when your child is going to be hungry and tired. Pack snacks and toys to keep your toddler busy. Be consistent. Stick to a routine that includes consistent times for meals, naps, and bedtimes. Your child will do better if they know what to expect. They will also handle frustration better if they are getting enough rest. Offer choices. Whenever possible, let your child make decisions. Children feel more in control if they can decide what toys to play with or what outfit to wear. Identify triggers. Avoid situations that are likely to cause your child to have a meltdown. Don't give your child toys that will frustrate them. Avoid sit-down restaurants if your child can't tolerate waiting. Reward good behavior . Catch your child being good. If your child behaves at dinner, point it out and compliment them. Help your child set an appropriate behavior goal and give them a reward for reaching it. Instead of a material reward, give your child special time with a parent or let them pick the movie for movie night."", 'How to Stop Tantrums When your toddler does have a tantrum, they will need your help to calm down. You can help your child if you: Stay calm. Shouting or responding angrily to your child will just make the situation worse. Try distraction. Give your child a toy or book. Offer to help if the tantrum is about cleaning up or doing a chore. Gently hold them. If your child is hitting, kicking, or trying to run away, hold them until they calm down. Explain the rules. When your child calms down, talk about the rules with them. Ignore the behavior. When you ignore the tantrum, this tells your child that the behavior is not acceptable. While doing this, keep them in sight and away from objects that could harm them or others.', 'When to Seek Help Aside from normal developmental stages, there are medical issues that can cause anger in children.

There is no known cure for polymyalgia rheumatica and temporal arteritis, but these diseases can be treated and controlled. Corticosteroids -- often called "" steroids "" -- help rapidly relieve the symptoms of both conditions. Treatment with steroids -- usually in the form of prednisone -- is mandatory for temporal arteritis to prevent serious complications, such as blindness. Low doses of steroids are often successful in treating polymyalgia rheumatica. Higher doses are often required to treat temporal arteritis. Steroids reduce the function of inflammatory cells that cause these illnesses. Consequently, steroids minimize tissue damage. Steroids also impair the immune system -- thus increasing the risk of infection. The decision to prescribe steroids is always made on an individual basis. Your doctor will consider your age, presence of other illnesses, and medications you are taking. Your doctor also will make sure you understand the potential benefits and risks of steroids before you start taking them.', 'You will have frequent blood tests while taking steroids or other medications to monitor for possible side effects and to evaluate the effectiveness of therapy. These blood tests can usually detect problems before you are aware of any symptoms. Your doctor will frequently evaluate your heart and lung function and blood sugar level, which may increase after you start taking steroids. While being treated for polymyalgia rheumatica or temporal arteritis, it is important to keep all appointments with your doctor and the lab, and have your blood pressure checked regularly.', 'Because the medicines used to treat polymyalgia and temporal arteritis increase your chance for developing infections, report symptoms such as a cough , fever, or shortness of breath to your doctor. Long-term steroid treatment (for a few months to several years) requires additional testing and monitoring. The long-term use of steroids can cause osteoporosis ( bone loss ), which can be detected with scans similar to X-rays. Taking supplements of calcium and vitamin D , sometimes along with prescription medication is recommended to prevent osteoporosis in people taking steroids. Discuss the potential side effects caused by your treatment with your doctor.', 'Temporal arteritis may also be treated with methotrexate or a biologic drug called tocilizumab (Actemra). Tocilizumab is given as an injection under the skin to decrease the amount of steroid a person needs. This medicine may be used along with steroids. Treatments work fairly quickly and have excellent results.', 'What Is the Long-Term Outlook for Polymyalgia Rheumatica and Temporal Arteritis? With careful monitoring and appropriate treatment, most patients with polymyalgia rheumatica or temporal arteritis have a normal life span and lifestyle. Most of the time, these diseases can be successfully controlled with steroids and other drugs (including tocilizumab, a rheumatoid arthritis drug which has been touted for people who have trouble with or do not respond to steroids). The success of treatment is related to prompt diagnosis, aggressive treatment, and careful follow-up to prevent or minimize side effects from the medications.']"
16,Temporary Blindness and Short-Term Vision Loss,"['You can temporarily lose your vision, totally or partially, due to another condition. The possible causes and what you should do depend on whether you can see at all. If you have sudden total, or near-total, vision loss, it’s an emergency. You need to call 911, because you have a short window of time to get it diagnosed and treated. Don’t wait to see if it goes away. If you have partial vision loss, a migraine is the most likely reason. But there are other, less common, causes that need prompt treatment to save your sight.', 'Sudden Total or Near-Total Vision Loss It can happen if a clot creates a blockage in your retinal artery. Your doctor may call it “central retinal artery occlusion” or “branch retinal artery occlusion.” It also means you’re at risk for a stroke or heart attack . It can happen if you get a blood clot that clogs a blood vessel in the eye. It’s similar to how a clot can trigger a heart attack if plaque in your coronary arteries breaks off and forms a clot. If the same thing happened in your brain, it would be an “ischemic” (clot-triggered) stroke.', 'Clots can cause temporary blindness in one eye, usually lasting 20 to 30 minutes. It often seems like a curtain of darkness falls (doctors call this “amaurosis fugax”). Without prompt treatment, this blockage may cause permanent blindness. Your doctor may prescribe a medicine to break up the clot. Some cases need angioplasty, a procedure to reopen the blockage in the blood vessel. And it’s also a wake-up call to lower your risk of a heart attack or stroke.', 'Temporary, Partial Vision Loss As with a total vision loss, any temporary or partial vision loss needs to be checked out immediately in the emergency room. If you have partial vision loss, the causes could include: Migraines : These are, by far, the most common cause of short-term, partial vision loss. When you get a migraine, you may have “aura” that affects the vision in both of your eyes. You may see flashing lights, shimmering spots, or blind spots.', 'A retinal migraine affects only one eye. This rare condition causes partial or total blindness for a short period, usually 10 to 30 minutes. It typically comes before or during a headache.\xa0It is typically harmless to you and your vision. Retinal vasospasm: Like migraine, this condition can cause\xa0temporary vision loss. Treatment can fully restore your sight. When a blood vessel in your retina tightens, it causes a vasospasm. This cuts down on blood flow, which can bring on temporary vision loss in one eye. Various conditions can lead to a vasospasm. These include a retinal migraine, atherosclerosis, and high blood pressure . If you have a retinal vasospasm, your doctor may recommend aspirin or a type of medicine called a calcium-channel blocker to relieve it. You’ll also work with your doctor to manage whatever caused the retinal vasospasm in the first place. Closed-angle glaucoma : When your eye’s iris bulges, it can prevent fluid from draining properly. This builds up pressure in your eye. You’d have a lot of discomfort, nausea, short-term blurred vision, halos, or blindness in one eye. Your doctor will look for a slightly enlarged pupil that doesn’t react to light. Without prompt treatment, it can cause permanent blindness.', 'Medicine you take as an eyedrop or as a pill, such as prostaglandins or beta-blockers, can help ease the pressure in your eye. If that doesn’t work, you may need an operation called an iridotomy. The surgeon makes a tiny hole in your iris, which lets the fluid drain and eases the pressure. Giant cell arteritis : This condition isn’t common, but it’s an important cause of vision loss in people older than 50. This disease causes inflammation in the linings of your arteries, particularly those in your head. Symptoms include head pain, scalp tenderness, jaw pain, fever, and fatigue. Giant cell arteritis also triggers vision loss, usually in one eye. Without treatment, it can result in permanent blindness in a week or two. Your doctor will probably first give you a corticosteroid, such as prednisone. You’ll likely feel better within a few days, but you may need to keep taking the drug for 1 or 2 years. A drug called tocilizumab (Actemra) is also approved to help treat giant cell arteritis.', 'Rare Causes These are very unlikely to be the cause of temporary vision loss. Retinal vein occlusion is when a vein in the retina gets blocked, often due to a blood clot. It can lead to a buildup or leak of fluid in the eye, as well as swelling. Some people have bouts of temporary vision loss leading up to this condition. It’s more likely to happen in people who have diabetes and health problems that affect blood flow, such as high blood pressure. Your doctor may inject corticosteroids to control the inflammation. You may also need another type of drug called an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor or laser treatment to cut the fluid buildup. Epileptic seizures: For about 5% to 10% of people with epilepsy, their seizures affect their occipital lobe, the part of the brain that controls vision. As a result, this disease can prompt vision loss during and after a seizure. If you have epilepsy, your doctor will recommend treatment to help prevent this and other complications.', 'Papilledema : This is a condition where pressure in the brain causes your optic nerve to swell. This can lead to vision changes, such as double vision, blurriness, and short-term blindness. It usually lasts for a few seconds. Other symptoms include headaches and vomiting. Papilledema may be the result of a tumor, abscess, or blood clot. High blood pressure, an infection, and certain medications can also put pressure on the brain. Uhthoff phenomenon: This affects only people with multiple sclerosis (MS) -- and it’s rare even among them. MS damages nerves, and it can make them more sensitive to heat. With Uhthoff phenomenon, a rise in your body temperature worsens your symptoms. It lasts less than a day. You can lose your vision in one or both eyes. You may also feel weaker, more numb, or dizzier than usual. Triggers for the condition include exercise, a fever, a hot bath, sun exposure, and stress. Your MS treatment should help prevent this and other complications.']"

It lets you move your jaw up and down and side to side, so you can talk, chew, and yawn. Problems with your jaw and the muscles in your face that control it are known as temporomandibular disorders (TMDs). Your doctor may also call it TMJ disorder or TMJ dysfunction.

Dentists believe symptoms arise from problems with the muscles of your jaw or with the parts of the joint itself. Injury to your jaw, the joint, or the muscles of your head and neck—like from a heavy blow or whiplash—can lead to TMDs. Other causes include: Grinding or clenching your teeth, which puts a lot of pressure on the joint Movement of the soft cushion or disc between the ball and socket of the joint Arthritis in the joint Stress, which can cause you to tighten facial and jaw muscles or clench your teeth Research shows that a bad bite or braces to straighten your teeth don't cause TMDs.

To figure out what's causing yours, the dentist will ask about your health history and conduct a physical exam. They'll check your jaw joints for pain or tenderness and listen for clicks, pops, or grating sounds when you move them. They'll also make sure your jaw works like it should and doesn't lock when you open or close your mouth. Plus they'll test your bite and check for problems with your facial muscles. Your dentist may take full face X-rays so they can view your jaws, TMJs, and teeth to rule out other problems. They may need to do other tests, like MRI or CT scan. The MRI can show if the TMJ disc is in the proper position as your jaw moves. A CT scan shows the bony detail of the joint. Your doctor or dentist could also suggest TMJ arthroscopy to diagnose a TMJ disorder. This surgery involves inserting a small thin tube (cannula) and then a camera (arthroscope) near your jaw joint to get a closer look at the area and make a diagnosis. You may get referred to an oral surgeon (also called an oral and maxillofacial surgeon) for further care and treatment. This doctor specializes in surgery in and around the entire face, mouth, and jaw area.

Your doctor may suggest you try some of these remedies together. Take over-the-counter medications. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), like naproxen or ibuprofen, can relieve muscle pain and swelling. Use moist heat or cold packs. Apply an ice pack to the side of your face and temple area for about 10 minutes. Do a few simple jaw stretches (if your dentist or physical therapist OKs them). When you're done, hold a warm towel or washcloth to the side of your face for about 5 minutes. Perform this routine a few times each day."", 'Eat soft foods. Add yogurt, mashed potatoes, cottage cheese, soup, scrambled eggs, fish, cooked fruits and vegetables, beans, and grains to your menu. Cut foods into small pieces so you chew less. Skip hard, crunchy foods (like pretzels and raw carrots), chewy foods (like caramels and taffy), and thick or large bites that require you to open wide.', ""Avoid extreme jaw movements. Keep yawning and chewing (especially gum or ice) to a minimum and don't yell, sing, or do anything that forces you to open wide. Don't rest your chin on your hand. Don't hold the phone between your shoulder and ear. Practice good posture to reduce neck and facial pain. Keep your teeth slightly apart. Do this as often as you can. This will relieve pressure on your jaw. Put your tongue between your teeth to control clenching or grinding during the day. Learn relaxation techniques. This will help loosen up your jaw. Ask your dentist if you need physical therapy or massage. Consider stress reduction therapy and biofeedback . Stop chewing certain items. This includes pens, pencils, ice, and gum.

You may have the habit of using your teeth to rip tags off of clothing or open packaging."", ""TMJ Disorder Treatments Talk to your dentist about these treatments of TMDs: Medications. Your dentist can prescribe higher doses of NSAIDs if you need them for pain and swelling. They might suggest a muscle relaxer to relax your jaw if you grind or clench your teeth or an antianxiety medication to relieve stress, which may bring on TMDs. In low doses, they can also help reduce or control pain. Muscle relaxants, antianxiety drugs, and antidepressants are available by prescription only. A splint or night guard. These plastic mouthpieces fit over your upper and lower teeth so they don't touch. They lessen the effects of clenching or grinding and correct your bite by putting your teeth in a better position. What's the difference between them? You wear night guards while you sleep. You use a splint all the time. Your dentist will tell you which type you need. Dental work. Your dentist can replace missing teeth and use crowns, bridges , or braces to balance the biting surfaces of your teeth or to correct a bite problem."", 'Other Treatments If the treatments listed above don\'t help, your dentist may suggest one or more of the following: Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation. This therapy uses low-level electrical currents to provide pain relief by relaxing your jaw joint and facial muscles. It can be done at the dentist\'s office or at home. Ultrasound. Deep heat applied to the joint can relieve soreness or improve mobility. Trigger-point injections. Pain medication or anesthesia is injected into tender facial muscles called ""trigger points"" to give relief. Radio wave therapy. Radio waves stimulate the joint, which increases blood flow and eases pain. Low-level laser therapy.

Tendinosis is most often caused by repetitive, minor impact on the affected area, or from a sudden more serious injury. There are many activities that can cause t endinosis , including: Gardening Raking Carpentry Cleaning house Shoveling Painting Scrubbing Tennis Golf Skiing Throwing and pitching Incorrect posture at work or home or poor conditioning before exercise or playing sports also increases a person\'s risk. Other risk factors for t endinosis include: An abnormal or poorly placed bone or joint (such as length differences in your legs or arthritis in a joint) that stresses soft-tissue structures. Stresses from other conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis , gout , psoriatic arthritis, thyroid disorders , or unusual medication reactions. Overuse or doing too much too soon when the tendons aren\'t used to making a movement or doing the task taken on. Tendinosis is common in ""weekend warriors,"" people that play and exercise hard only on weekends. Occasionally an infection can cause t endinosis , especially infection from a cat or dog bite to the hand or a finger. Psoriatic arthritis. This is a combination of a skin disorder (psoriasis) and joint inflammation (arthritis). You most often may notice throbbing pain and stiffness over the tendons of your fingers, hands, and toes.', 'Who Gets Tendinosis? Anyone can get t endinosis , but it is more common in adults, especially those over age 40.\xa0As tendons age they tolerate less stress, are less elastic, and are easier to tear.', 'Where Does Tendinosis\xa0Occur? Tendinosis can occur in almost any area of the body where a tendon connects a bone to a muscle. The most common places are: Base of the thumb Elbow Shoulder Hip Knee Achilles tendon', 'What Are the Symptoms of Tendinosis? The symptoms of t endinosis include: Pain at the site of the tendon and surrounding area. Pain may gradually build up or be sudden and severe, especially if calcium deposits are present. Loss of motion in the shoulder, called ""adhesive capsulitis"" or frozen shoulder.', 'How Can I Avoid Tendinitis? To avoid t endinosis , try these tips when performing activities: Take it slow at first. Gradually build up your activity level. Use limited force and limited repetitions. Stop if pain occurs. Do something else. Try again later and if pain recurs, stop that activity for the day.', 'How Is Tendinosis\xa0Treated? Initial treatment of t endinosis includes: Avoiding activities that aggravate the problem Resting the injured area Icing the area the day of the injury Taking over-the-counter anti-inflammatory drugs or using topical anti-inflammatory gels If the condition does not improve in a week, see your doctor. You may need more advanced treatments, including: Corticosteroid injections. Corticosteroids (often called simply ""steroids"") are often used because they work quickly to decrease the inflammation and pain. Physical therapy . This can be very beneficial, especially for a ""frozen shoulder."" Physical therapy includes range-of-motion exercises and splinting (thumb, forearm, bands). Surgery. This is only rarely needed for severe problems not responding to other treatments.', 'How Long Will Recovery From Tendinosis\xa0Take? Tendinosis may take weeks to months to go away, depending on the severity of your injury.', 'Warning You should see your doctor if you experience any of the following: Fever (over 100 degrees Fahrenheit) Swelling, redness, and warmth General illness or multiple sites of pain Inability to move the affected area These could be signs of another problem that needs more immediate attention.']"
19,What Is Tenosynovitis?,"['Tendinitis is when something -- injury, illness, repeated motion -- inflames one of your tendons, the cords of tissue that hold muscle to bone . When it also irritates the sleeve of tissue, or sheath, around the tendon, you have tenosynovitis.', 'What Are the Symptoms? The inflamed tendon may be painful and swollen. You may notice it more when you use it, especially if a repeated motion like swinging a hammer or a tennis racquet caused it. When the tendon sheath gets swollen, fluid can build up and make your symptoms worse. You may feel swelling and in some cases see it, too. The area can get so tender that it hurts even to touch it. It might happen anywhere you have muscles and tendons, but it’s more likely in your: Shoulder Upper arm Forearm ( biceps ) Hands and fingers Knee Achilles (thick, ropey tissue that runs from calf muscle to heel) If you have these symptoms in your thumb, then you probably have a specific type called De Quervain ’s tenosynovitis. It results from an inflamed tendon at the base of your thumb. You might feel: Pain along the thumb-side of the wrist A catching or clicking when you use it Your symptoms typically worsen when you try to squeeze or grab something or turn your wrist. And you’re more likely to get it when you’re pregnant , though doctors aren’t sure why.', 'Causes and Risk Factors It isn’t always clear what causes tenosynovitis (or tendinitis), though it usually starts in middle age. Repeated motions like jumping, throwing, or running might be to blame, or it might happen if you do something sudden like lifting an unusually heavy load. New movements, especially over your head, like painting the ceiling, also could play a role. Arthritis and inflammatory diseases that wear down your joints may\xa0cause problems in surrounding tendons and tissues. This can sometimes lead to the long-term, or chronic, form of tenosynovitis. Serious cases can form cysts that tear or break tendons, change the shape of your hand , and make it hard to use. Certain medicines like fluoroquinolone antibiotics ( Cipro , Noroxin ) and statins , which treat high cholesterol , also might raise your risk for tendon damage that leads to tenosynovitis.', 'How Is Tenosynovitis Diagnosed? The doctor can usually diagnose you from your symptoms and a physical exam . They might push on affected areas or ask you to make specific motions and see if they hurt.', 'Let them know how the area feels. Does it tingle? Burn ? Does it get better when you rest? Be sure to tell them about any new increase in work or exercise patterns. If all this isn’t enough to diagnose you, the doctor might take pictures of the area with an MRI or ultrasound machine to confirm or to rule out other causes.', 'How Is Tenosynovitis Treated? Rest is usually the first treatment. The quicker you start, the better it will work. Where possible, try to stop the things that cause your symptoms. You might even need a splint or brace to keep that part of your body from moving. When it flares up, ice the inflamed area for 20 minutes at a time. Heat might be more useful for chronic tendinitis. Talk to your doctor if you’re unsure. Over-the-counter medications like nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) can also help. Your doctor might suggest larger than standard doses depending on your level of pain and swelling or if you have conditions like rheumatoid arthritis . In some cases, they might inject a corticosteroid to reduce inflammation .', 'Once swelling and pain are down, you should start to slowly and gently increase your range of motion. If your tenosynovitis is severe, your doctor or physical therapist might give you a set of exercises to help with this. You may need to do them several times a day. In rare cases, you might need surgery to repair a tendon or remove hard bits of calcium that can build up and cause tendon problems.', 'Tips to Prevent Tenosynovitis Tenosynovitis typically starts with tendinitis. Though it isn’t always clear what causes either one, there are some things you can do that might lower your risk. Take breaks. Try not to stay in the same position for too long. For example, if work keeps you still for hours on end, take breaks and move around every 30 minutes or so if you can. Don’t do the same thing over and over without a break. Whether it’s typing, throwing a baseball, or playing piano scales, mix up your movements to stay balanced and to give your body a chance to rest.', 'Learn how to lift. Take care when you lift things. Use a firm but not overly tight grip when it’s unusually heavy, and avoid lifting with just one arm or only one side of your body. Move the right way. Learn the right way to do the physical movements for all your sports and activities. Whether you lift weights, shoot free throws, or play the cello, there are proper techniques that can prevent injury. Trainers, teachers, coaches, and physical therapists can help you learn proper form. If you notice that some movement causes pain, stop and ask questions. Warm up before you exercise . About 5 to 10 minutes of light jogging or jumping jacks should be enough.', 'Living With Tenosynovitis It’s important to rest as soon as you notice symptoms. If you don’t, you could rupture a tendon or its sheath, which can be hard to repair. If your symptoms are very painful, won’t go away, or stop you from living your life normally for more than a few days, see your doctor. They might notice an underlying condition that you can treat. They’ll give you the right mix of rest, medication, and physical therapy to get you on the road to recovery.']"
20,Tennis Elbow (Lateral Epicondylitis),"[""What Is Tennis Elbow? Tennis elbow is a common injury for people ages 30-60 and causes pain in the outer part of your elbow. Most people don't need surgery to get relief. (Photo Credit: Science Photo Library/Getty Images) Tennis elbow, also known as lateral epicondylitis, is a type of tendinitis (swelling of the tendons) that causes pain in your elbow and arm. These tendons are bands of tough tissue that connect the muscles of your lower arm to the bone."", ""Causes of Tennis Elbow Despite the name, you can get tennis elbow even if you've never been near a tennis court. Any repeated arm movement can inflame your tendons. Tennis elbow is the most common reason for elbow pain. It can pop up in people of any age, but it most hits people between ages 30 and 60. Tennis elbow usually develops over time. Repeated motions, like gripping a tennis racket during a swing, can strain your muscles and leave the work up to your tendons, causing them to become inflamed and ripe for microscopic tears. Tennis elbow might result from jobs or hobbies that require repeated arm movements such as: Tennis Racquetball Squash Fencing Weightlifting Carpentry Typing Painting Raking Knitting"", ""Symptoms of Tennis Elbow The main symptom of tennis elbow is pain and tenderness in the bony knob on the outside of your elbow. This knob is where the injured tendons connect to the bone. The pain may also radiate into your upper or lower arm, and you can have tennis elbow in both arms. Although the tendon damage is in your elbow, you're likely to feel pain when doing things with your hands. Tennis elbow pain may be most intense when you: Lift something Make a fist or grip an object, such as a tennis racket Open a door or shake hands Raise your hand or straighten your wrist Talk to your doctor if you have any of these symptoms: Trouble moving your arm(s) A lump or bulge in your elbow or arm Pain that keeps you from your everyday activities Your elbow is red or swollen Tennis elbow pain usually worsens over time. Talk to your doctor if your symptoms don't improve for several months."", 'Tennis Elbow Diagnosis Your doctor will ask about your symptoms and medical history. They’ll check for pain in parts of your arm and ask you to move your arm, elbow, wrist, and fingers in certain ways to see if you have discomfort. They may also do more tests like: Electromyography will help your doctor see whether you have a problem with the nerves in your elbow. MRI can show how severe the damage is to the tendons in your elbow. It also can find arthritis in your neck or problems in your back that could cause pain in your elbow. X-rays can look at the bones in your elbow to check for arthritis.', 'Treatment for Tennis Elbow Rest is the best treatment for tennis elbow. It usually heals on its own if you can stop the constant movements that caused it. Here are other nonsurgical ways to treat tennis elbow: Ice : Experts recommend icing for 15 minutes every 3 to 4 hours to reduce pain and swelling. Mulligan mobilisation with movement and taping : This is a form of physical therapy that repositions the muscles to protect the injured tendons from further strain. Physical therapy : A professional can show you exercises to strengthen and stretch the muscles in your shoulder, upper arm, and wrists. Steroids : Shots into your elbow tendons can briefly ease some of the swelling and pain around your elbow joint. Botox : Studies show that these shots can treat chronic tennis elbow. Needle fenestration : This treatment uses a special ultrasound to repeatedly guide a needle into the injured tendon to increase blood flow and promote healing. Ultrasonic tenotomy : Also called Tenex, this procedure uses ultrasound to guide a needle into the damaged tendon. Then the needle is vibrated with ultrasonic energy so fast, it turns injured tissue to liquid so it can be removed. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) therapy : Your platelets (cells in your blood that stop bleeding) are separated from your other blood cells and then injected back into the injured tendons to encourage healing.', ""Most of the time, these treatments will do the trick. You can also take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ), such as ibuprofen , naproxen , or aspirin , for pain and swelling. If you have a severe case of tennis elbow that doesn't respond to 2-4 months of \xa0treatment, you may need surgery. You and your doctor will decide which type of surgery is best for you. Surgical options include: Open surgery . Your surgeon makes a cut above the bone on the side of your elbow, removes the damaged tendon, and reattaches the healthy part back to the bone. They might also remove a tiny piece of bone in your elbow to improve blood flow and help the area heal faster. Arthroscopic surgery . Your surgeon makes a few tiny cuts in the skin over your elbow. Then they use very small instruments and a camera to perform the procedure. With either type of surgery, the opening is closed with sutures (a row of stitches) or staples. Then it's covered with a bandage or other dressing. You should be able to go home on the same day as your surgery."", ""Recovering From Tennis Elbow How long it takes to recover from tennis elbow depends on the extent of the damage to your tendon and your treatment. But don't rush the healing process. If you start pushing yourself to use your arm too early, you could make the damage worse. You're ready to return to your former level of activity when: Gripping objects or bearing weight on your arm or elbow is no longer painful. Your injured elbow feels as strong as your other elbow. Your elbow is no longer swollen. You can flex and move your elbow without any trouble."", 'How to Prevent Tennis Elbow As much as you can, try not to overuse your elbow. Stop if you feel any elbow pain during an activity. You can also: In general : Make sure your arms are strong and flexible. Avoid repetitive arm and wrist movements. Use your shoulder and upper arms to take the strain off your elbow. Avoid bending or straightening your arm all the way.', 'At work : Avoid working with a bent wrist. Keep it straight, if possible. Talk to your manager about rotating jobs, doing different tasks, or changing your workstation setup to reduce strain. Hold tools with a looser grip to take some of the tension out of your hand. If you use a hammer, use one with padding to help absorb shock. For sports : Stretch and warm up before any sport or activity that will exercise your elbow or arm. If you have a coach, ask them to help with your form. The correct technique can help avoid injury. When playing tennis, stick with a two-handed backhand. Make sure you have fresh, dry tennis balls.

21,Back Pain: What You Need to Know,"[""There's a lot riding on your spinal column. It's your body's main structural support. It needs to keep you stable enough to stand upright but flexible enough for movement. So it's no surprise that many people have back problems from time to time. The hurt can stem from sore muscles , ligaments, and tendons, or from herniated disks, fractures , and other problems in your upper, middle, and lower back. Sometimes you feel the effects right away. But in many cases, back problems develop over time."", 'Causes We often bring on our back problems through bad habits, such as: Poor posture, like sitting incorrectly at a desk or behind the steering wheel Repeating the same motion or overdoing it Pushing, pulling, and lifting things carelessly The spine is actually a stack of 24 bones called vertebrae. A healthy spine is S-shaped when viewed from the side. It curves back at your shoulders and inward at your neck and small of your back. It houses and protects your spinal cord, the network of nerves that transmit feeling and control movement throughout your entire body.', ""One of the more common types of back pain comes from straining the bands of muscles surrounding the spine . It happens most often in the curve of the low back and the base of the neck. These areas support more weight than your upper and mid back, which are less prone to trouble. Injuries from contact sports, accidents, and falls can cause problems ranging from minor muscle strains, to herniated disks, to fractures that damage the spinal column or cord. Stabbing low back pain could be from muscle spasms, when your muscles seize up and don't relax, like a cramp. Osteoarthritis can affect your vertebrae, when the cartilage between them wears down. Bone spurs or a herniated disk can push on nerves. Pregnancy often brings on back pain , too. Hormonal changes and weight gain put new kinds of stresses on a pregnant woman's spine and legs. Sometimes your back might be sore for no clear reason. That's called nonspecific backache. It could come from weak muscles that can't handle everyday walking, bending, and stretching ."", ""Other Symptoms Back pain -- whether a dull ache or shooting -- is just one sign that something's going on with your back. You may also have feelings in your legs or arms: Radiating pain Numbness Tingling Weakness Uncontrolled peeing or pooping , or inability to pee, and muscle weakness could mean a serious problem like spinal cord compression. Call your doctor right away."", ""Diagnosis You should see a doctor: After you get hurt, like in a fall or accident When the pain gets in the way of your daily activities If it lasts longer than 6 weeks, or spreads During your exam, your doctor will test your range of motion -- unless you can't move -- and check how well your nerves are working. That may be enough to decide what to do next. You might need imaging tests, like X-rays, an MRI , or a CT scan . But they're not always useful, and there's not always a direct link between the results of these tests and how much it hurts."", ""Treatment Your specific treatment will depend on what's causing your pain and where in your back it is. Despite what you may think or have been told before, staying in bed isn't usually the answer; gentle exercise is. It will help work out the kinks, build support for your spine, and improve your flexibility. A physical therapist can work with you to design a set of exercises, give you relief from the pain, and get you moving again. Over-the-counter pain relievers, ice, and heat will work to take the edge off most back pain. Your doctor can prescribe stronger medicines, but some can make you drowsy or dependent on them if you're not careful. Complementary therapies, such as chiropractic spinal manipulation, acupuncture , and massage , can help ease pain, too. If a bone is damaged, or you have a herniated disk or pinched nerve , you may need surgery. But for ongoing back pain, doctors will try other treatments first. Counseling could help you learn to live with chronic pain better as well as deal with symptoms of depression because of it."", ""Prevention Exercise ! Strengthening the muscles around your spine and in your core will help keep you stable and balanced. Walking is great for your low back, and it's simple to do. Practice good posture. As a rule of thumb, aim to keep your ears, shoulders, and hips aligned when you sit, stand, and walk. Lift heavy things correctly, using your hips and knees for power while keeping your back straight. Try sleeping on your side, with a medium-firm mattress. Don't smoke. It restricts blood flow, so your muscles and tissues don't get a good supply of nutrients and oxygen.""]"
22,Thalassemia,"['What Is Thalassemia? Thalassemia is an inherited blood condition. If you have it, your body has fewer red blood cells and less hemoglobin than it should. Hemoglobin is important because it lets your red blood cells carry oxygen to all parts of your body. Because of this, people with this condition may have anemia , which makes you feel tired . You may hear it called things like Constant Spring, Cooley’s anemia, or hemoglobin Bart’s hydrops fetalis. These are common names for different forms of it. The two types are alpha thalassemia and beta thalassemia. The terms alpha and beta refer to the part of the hemoglobin the person is lacking. There are also terms for how serious the thalassemia is. A person with a trait or minor form may not have symptoms or only mild ones. They may not need treatment. Someone with a major form will need medical treatment.', 'Thalassemia Causes and Risk Factors Thalassemia is genetic. It happens when you inherit mutated genes from your parents that change your hemoglobin. You have it from birth. You can’t catch thalassemia the way you catch a cold or the flu. If both of your parents carry thalassemia, you might get it. If you inherit two or more copies of abnormal genes from your parents, you may get mild to severe thalassemia, depending on what type of protein is affected. It’s more common in people from Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Mediterranean countries like Greece or Turkey.', ""Thalassemia Types Thalassemia is really a group of blood problems, not just one. To make hemoglobin, you need two proteins, alpha and beta. Without enough of one or the other, your red blood cells can’t carry oxygen the way they should. Alpha thalassemia means you don't make enough of the alpha hemoglobin protein chain to make your hemoglobin. With beta thalassemia, you don't make enough of the beta. You have four genes responsible for making the alpha protein chain of hemoglobin. You get two from each parent. If you have one abnormal copy of an alpha gene, you won’t have thalassemia but you’ll carry it. If you have two abnormal copies of an alpha gene, you’ll have mild alpha thalassemia. If you have more abnormal copies, you’ll have more serious alpha thalassemia. Babies with four abnormal copies of the alpha gene are often stillborn, or don’t survive long after birth. You have two genes that are needed to make the beta protein. You get one from each of your parents. If you have one abnormal copy of the beta gene, you’ll have mild beta thalassemia. If you have two copies, you’ll have more moderate to severe beta thalassemia."", 'Thalassemia Symptoms These can include: Slow growth in children Wide or brittle bones Enlarged spleen (an organ in your abdomen that filters blood and fights disease) Fatigue Weakness Pale or yellow skin Dark urine Poor appetite Heart problems In some people, symptoms show up at birth. In others, it can take a couple of years to see anything. Some people who have thalassemia will show no signs at all.', 'Thalassemia Diagnosis If you think you may have thalassemia, or if your parents have it, you should see a doctor. They will examine you and will ask questions. Children with moderate to severe thalassemia usually have signs by age 2. If a doctor suspects thalassemia, you’ll take blood tests. One is a CBC (complete blood count) test. The other is a hemoglobin electrophoresis test. If you are pregnant or trying to have a baby , you can have tests to learn if your baby will have the condition. Genetic testing can show if you or your partner carries any of the genes that cause thalassemia. Chorionic villus sampling tests a tiny piece of the placenta to see if a baby has the genes that cause thalassemia. Doctors usually do this test around the 11th week of pregnancy. Amniocentesis tests the fluid around an unborn baby . Doctors usually do this test around the 16th week of pregnancy. If you do have thalassemia, you should see a blood expert known as a hematologist. You may also need other special doctors on your team, like those who treat the heart or liver .', 'Thalassemia Treatment and Home Care If you have thalassemia, follow these habits to stay well: Eat a healthy diet to keep your bones strong and give you energy. If you get a fever or feel ill, see your doctor. Stay away from sick people and wash your hands often. Stay up to date with vaccines. Ask your doctor about supplements like calcium and vitamin D . Don’t take iron pills. With a mild case, you may feel tired and not need treatment. But if it’s more serious, your organs may not get the oxygen they need. Treatment might include: Blood transfusions. A transfusion is a way to get donated blood or parts of blood that your body needs, like hemoglobin. How often you need transfusions can vary. Some people have one every few weeks. Your transfusion schedule may change as you get older. Chelation therapy. Blood transfusions are important for people with thalassemia. But they can cause too much iron in the blood. That can lead to problems with the heart, liver, and blood sugar . If you get transfusions, you and your doctor will talk about whether you need medicine that can help remove extra iron from your body. Stem cell or bone marrow transplant . An infusion of stem cells from a matched donor can sometimes cure thalassemia. Supplements. In some cases, your doctor might recommend that you take extra folic acid or other supplements. Surgery. Some people with thalassemia may need their spleen removed.', 'Sometimes, blood transfusions cause reactions like a high fever, nausea , diarrhea , chills , and low blood pressure . If you have any of these, see your doctor. Donated blood in the U.S. is very safe. But there’s a remote chance that you could get an infection from a blood transfusion . Work closely with your doctor, and keep up with your treatments.', 'Thalassemia Complications If a person’s anemia becomes severe, it can cause permanent organ damage and even death. Some people with moderate to severe thalassemia have other health problems. These may include: Iron overload. Too much iron can damage your heart, liver, and endocrine system . Bone changes. Your bones may become thin and brittle. And the bones in your face can look out of shape or distorted. Slowed growth. You may be shorter than others because your bones don’t grow normally. Puberty may be delayed. Enlarged spleen. Your spleen filters old or damaged blood cells. If you have thalassemia, your spleen might have to work too hard. Sometimes a doctor may need to remove it. If a doctor has to remove your spleen, you will be at higher risk for infection. Heart problems. Thalassemia increases your risk for congestive heart failure and abnormal heart rhythms. These problems don’t happen to everyone who has thalassemia.', 'Thalassemia Prevention You can’t prevent thalassemia, since it’s in your genes. If you have it and you want to have children, you might want to talk with a genetics counselor. This is an expert in health issues that are passed down through families. The counselor will explain your chance of having a child with thalassemia. If you and/or your partner carry thalassemia and your future children will be at risk, it’s possible to make sure they won’t have it with in vitro fertilization (IVF). A doctor will test the embryos before choosing which to implant.', 'Thalassemia Outlook Your outlook will depend on how severe your thalassemia is. Some people will have only mild symptoms. For others, it’s more severe. Severe thalassemia can lead to heart failure and an early death. But many people with thalassemia live as long as people without thalassemia. New treatments mean that people with thalassemia are now living longer with fewer symptoms. You may also want to look into joining a support group, so you can connect with other people who have the condition.']"

24,Thoracic Outlet Syndrome,"['What Is Thoracic Outlet Syndrome? Thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) is when you have pain, swelling, or other symptoms from compression in your thoracic outlet -- the opening between your lower neck and upper chest. It can cause numbness and tingling in your arms or pain in your shoulders, especially when you raise your arms. The thoracic outlet is the narrow space between your collarbone and top rib. Muscles run through it from your neck to your shoulder , along with the nerves and blood vessels that go down your arm. When something presses on them, you can have pain and other symptoms.', 'Thoracic Outlet Syndrome Types There are 3 types of thoracic outlet syndrome: Neurogenic: Affects nerves leading from the spinal cord to the neck to the arm. Most thoracic outlet syndrome cases involve nerves. Venous: Affects veins Arterial: Affects arteries About 95% of thoracic outlet syndrome cases involve nerves. It’s rare but more serious when it affects a vein or an artery. The condition is more common in women. It’s also often seen in athletes and workers who make repeated arm motions. But it can affect anyone.', 'Thoracic Outlet Syndrome Symptoms You’re most likely to feel them in your arms and hands. They include: Pain in the neck, shoulder, or arm Numbness and tingling Swelling Weakness Discoloration -- blue, red, or pale Cold hands Atrophy (when the tissue or muscle in your arm starts to waste away) Weak pulse in your affected arm Painful lump near your collarbone Shrinking of the muscle in the fleshy base of your thumb (also called Gilliatt-Sumner hand)', 'Thoracic Outlet Syndrome Causes and Risk Factors There are several causes: Injuries: Whiplash , a broken collarbone, or other injury can leave scar tissue and inflammation . Poor posture: When your shoulders slump, your collarbones can move out of place and press on your nerves. Weak shoulder muscles can cause bad posture. Repetitive stress: It can affect people who move their arms in a certain way over and over again. Physical defects: Some people are born with an extra rib or a thoracic outlet that’s smaller than normal. Obesity : Extra weight can put stress on the muscles that support your collarbones. Pregnancy: TOS can happen as your joints begin to get looser. Sleep disorders Tumors, especially in your upper chest or under your arm Stress or depression', 'TOS is found more often in women than in men and primarily in young people, mostly ages 20-40. Athletes who move their arms in the same way a lot, like swimmers or baseball pitchers, also can be more likely to have it.', 'Thoracic Outlet Syndrome Diagnosis Your doctor will start by asking questions to get a detailed history of your symptoms and then do a physical exam . Neurogenic: This type isn’t always easy to spot. Things can compress the nerves that serve your arms and hands in different places for a variety of reasons. The symptoms will be the same, but the problem could be arthritis in your neck, a pinched nerve , or carpal tunnel syndrome . Other conditions like a damaged rotator cuff , fibromyalgia , and multiple sclerosis can cause pain and numbness in your shoulders and arms. Another example is thinning or wasting of the muscle at the base of the thumb. This can happen with carpal tunnel syndrome too.', 'Venous and arterial: These symptoms are more obvious. Blood doesn’t circulate properly. You may even have a blood clot . Your arm or hand may be swollen, and look either pale or bluish. You may have a weak pulse or no pulse in the affected arm. Several kinds of tests can help with the diagnosis: Positioning tests: The doctor will move your arms and head in different ways to see if the symptoms appear. One shortfall: These tests can also cause symptoms in healthy people. Scalene muscle block: The doctor will give you a shot that relaxes muscles in this area to see if that makes the symptoms go away. Imaging tests: An X-ray, CT scan , or MRI can reveal an extra rib or other abnormal physical feature. An ultrasound can look for blockages or narrowing of blood vessels. Nerve tests: Results are usually normal in people with this condition, but they can rule out other causes. Blood circulation tests: An arteriogram or venogram (tests that use dyes and X-rays to see how blood flows in your system) can show blood clots or other damage to blood vessels.', 'Thoracic Outlet Syndrome Treatment and Home Remedies Management of TOS depends on the type. Neurogenic: The usual treatments are: Physical therapy: You’ll do exercises to stretch and strengthen muscles in your neck and shoulders and improve your posture. This may be all you need to get relief. Medication : The doctor may recommend that you use a muscle relaxant or that you take ibuprofen or naproxen to ease pain and swelling. You may hear your doctor call these NSAIDS , or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Botox shots: A shot into the muscle at the base of your neck can relax the area and help ease pain. This can work for up to 3 months and be repeated if you need it. Surgery is sometimes an option, but it doesn’t work nearly as well for this type of TOS. Venous and arterial: First you’ll be treated for any possible blood clots . Then you’ll most likely need a type of surgery called thoracic outlet decompression. Your surgeon will open up the space for the nerves and blood vessels to pass through. They may remove extra bone or other tissue, and cut or remove muscles that are causing the compression. They’ll also fix or bypass damaged blood vessels.', 'If other treatments don’t fix your symptoms, you may need long-term pain management. You may need medication. Your doctor also may recommend a few things you can do to feel better: Get to a healthy weight. Set up your workstation to support good posture. Avoid things that aggravate the condition, like carrying a heavy bag on your shoulder. Take breaks often at work to move and stretch. Try a massage or a heating pad on your muscles. Do relaxation exercises, like visualization, autogenic relaxation (repeating a word that gives you peace), or progressive muscle relaxation (clinching then releasing different muscles).', 'Thoracic Outlet Syndrome Complications TOS should be treated as soon as possible. If it’s not, it can lead to more serious issues, like: Pain and swelling in your arm that doesn’t go away Nerve damage Blood flow problems , like gangrene (the loss of body tissue) or ischemic ulcers (open sores on your fingers) Blood clots , which can cause an extremely serious condition called pulmonary embolism (when a clot blocks a blood vessel in one of your lungs)']"
25,Buerger’s Disease (Thromboangiitis Obliterans),"['What Is Buerger’s Disease? Buerger’s disease is a rare illness that inflames and blocks blood vessels in your arms and legs. This stops blood flow and leads to clots that affect your hands and feet . Doctors also call it thromboangiitis obliterans , or TAO. There’s no cure for Buerger’s disease. Almost everyone who gets it uses tobacco , including cigarettes, cigars , chewing tobacco, and snuff. Quitting can make the symptoms improve or go away completely. If you don’t quit, you might have severe tissue damage. You could even lose your fingers, toes, or parts of your limbs.', 'Causes of Buerger’s Disease Doctors aren’t sure exactly what causes this condition. Your genes might play a role. Some people may just be more likely to get it. Some experts think that certain chemicals in tobacco might irritate your blood vessels, and that’s what makes them swell. Others think tobacco triggers your immune system to attack your blood vessels like they’re bad germs.', 'Buerger’s Disease Symptoms Usually, the first sign of Buerger’s disease is pain in your hands or feet that spreads to your arms and legs. It may be severe. You can get it when you’re active (called claudication) or resting. It can be worse when you’re cold or stressed. You might also notice changes in your hands and feet. They may: Feel cold , numb, or tingly Look pale, red, or blue in color Have thin, shiny skin Have less hair than usual Your fingers and toes might: Get painful open sores Turn pale when you’re cold (Raynaud’s phenomenon) You could also have swelling along a vein just under your skin. This is usually a sign of a blood clot . See your doctor right away.', 'Buerger’s Disease Complications Over time, Buerger’s disease can slow -- and completely stop -- the blood flow to your fingers and toes. This can cause gangrene , which means the skin and tissue in your toes and fingers start to die. They go numb and turn blue or black. If you have gangrene, your doctor usually has to cut off the affected area. In rare cases, Buerger’s disease can cause a stroke or heart attack .', 'Buerger’s Disease Diagnosis No single test can check for Buerger’s disease. Your doctor will start by asking about your tobacco use and your symptoms. They may do tests to check your blood flow and rule out other diseases that cause similar symptoms. For example, peripheral artery disease also causes pain in your legs, but it’s caused by plaque building up in your arteries , not inflammation . You may also have: The Allen test. This is a basic blood flow test. First, you squeeze your hand into a hard fist, which pushes blood out of your hand. Your doctor then presses on the arteries of your wrist to slow the flow of blood back into your hand. At this point, your hand will lose color. When you open your hand, your doctor releases the pressure over the artery on one side of your wrist and then the other side. If it takes a while for your hand to go back to its usual color, it may be a sign of Buerger’s disease. Angiogram. This is a type of X-ray that checks for blocked blood vessels in your arms and legs. Your doctor places a thin tube, called a catheter, into your artery. They pump dye into the artery and quickly take X-rays to get a look at your blood vessels. A CT or MRI scan can make similar pictures. Blood tests. These help your doctor rule out other diseases. They may want to check for conditions like diabetes , lupus , and those that cause blood clots .', 'Buerger’s Disease Treatment Quitting tobacco is the only way to limit the effects of Buerger’s disease. Even a few cigarettes a day can make it worse. Other treatments may help boost blood flow and ease pain, including: Medications such as vasodilators to widen your blood vessels or others to dissolve clots Walking exercises Intermittent compression of your arms and legs Surgery to cut nerves to an affected area (sympathectomy) Your doctor might need to cut off part or all of an area with infection or gangrene ( amputation ). Researchers are also studying other treatments. Proteins called growth factors might speed healing and ease pain. Injections of stem cells , which can grow into other kinds of cells, may help your body make new blood vessels.', 'Buerger’s Disease Prognosis Your outlook depends on whether you quit tobacco. Of patients who keep using it, about 43% will have an amputation within 8 years of diagnosis. Of those who quit, about 6% have an amputation. That percentage is close to 0 in people who are diagnosed early on. If you’re having a hard time quitting, talk to your doctor about programs that might help.']"
26,Thrombocytopenia (Low Platelet Count),"['What Is Thrombocytopenia? Thrombocytopenia is the condition when you don’t have enough platelets in your blood. Platelets are small blood cells that clot your blood after you get any cut or scrape that bleeds or a bigger injury.These cells stick together, which stops bleeding. You need platelets for your blood to clot. When your platelet counts are low, you may be at risk for bleeding.(Photo credit: Skypixel/Dreamstime) If you\'re wondering what the long name means, here\'s how it breaks down: ""Thrombocytes"" is another name for your platelets, and ""penia"" means you don\'t have enough of something. Put those terms together, and you get ""thrombocytopenia."" A healthy person usually has a platelet count of 150,000 to 450,000 in every microliter of blood. (A single drop of blood has about 35 microliters.) You have low platelets and thrombocytopenia if your lab values fall under 150,000.', ""Thrombocytopenia Symptoms Usually, you won't feel anything when you have thrombocytopenia. The condition often has no symptoms. But when you do have symptoms, they can include: Bleeding. This happens most often from your gums or nose. Thrombocytopenia also can cause heavier or longer periods or breakthrough bleeding if you have a menstrual cycle. You may also see blood in your pee or poop. Blotches and bruises . You might have large areas of bleeding under the skin that don't turn white when you press on them. You also might see what looks like the bruises you get from a bump or after being hit. They could be blue or purple and change to yellow or green over time. These are caused from the inside by the sudden leaking from tiny blood vessels. The medical name for these is purpura. Red, flat spots on your skin. You'll see these spots the size of a pinhead mostly on your legs and feet, and they may appear in clumps. Your doctor may call them petechiae. Petechiae don't turn white when you put pressure on them. Fatigue. Low platelets by itself won't make you feel run down and tired. But other conditions that cause low platelets can leave you feeling fatigued. Enlarged spleen. You'll have this if your spleen is trapping platelets, which may be one reason for your low counts."", ""Thrombocytopenia Causes Thrombocytopenia has many possible causes. Sometimes it runs in families, but it's rare. Low platelet counts are more often related to one of many medical conditions or medicines you take for another condition. If your low platelet counts are caused by another condition, treating the underlying problem may help. In general, anything that makes your body make less platelets than it needs will cause low platelet counts. You also can have low counts if your body is breaking platelets down or using them up faster than it's making new ones. Your platelet counts also can be low if your spleen or another part of your body is trapping platelets more than it should. Conditions or things that can cause your body to make too few platelets include: Leukemia or other cancer types Certain anemias (when your blood doesn't have enough red blood cells) Viral infections, including hepatitis C or HIV Certain medicines or treatments, including chemotherapy or radiation Drinking too much alcohol Toxins, including pesticides or arsenic"", ""Conditions or things that can cause your body to break platelets down too fast include: Pregnancy Autoimmune diseases, including lupus or rheumatoid arthritis Bacterial or viral infections Medicines that make your immune system destroy platelets Certain rare conditions, including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura or hemolytic uremic syndrome Conditions or things that can cause too many of your platelets to get lost or trapped include: Alcohol abuse or alcohol use disorder Bleeding or hemorrhage Pregnancy Liver disease Blood clots in your lungs (pulmonary embolism) High blood pressure in your lungs (pulmonary hypertension) What are the most common low platelet count causes? The most common reason for low platelet counts is another health condition or a medicine you're taking for another health condition. Some other risk factors for low platelets include: Family history Genetics Age"", 'Types of Thrombocytopenia You can have different types of thrombocytopenia depending on what\'s causing your low platelet counts: Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) One of the most common causes of low platelets is a condition called immune thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP). You may hear it called by its old name, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. ""Purpura"" means that your skin looks purple like it\'s bruised. Although doctors don\'t know why ITP happens, the problem is that your immune system isn\'t working right. Your antibodies, which should attack infections, destroy your platelets by mistake.', ""ITP comes in two types: acute and chronic. Acute ITP usually happens in kids after a virus like chickenpox. It comes on fast and goes away in weeks or months. You probably won't need any treatment, and it usually won't come back. Chronic ITP means you'll have it for 6 months or more. Chronic ITP is more common in adults than it is in kids. But teens also can get it. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) TTP doesn't happen a lot, but it's dangerous when it does. When you have TTP, you'll get many blood clots throughout your body. These clots can make your organs not work right or damage them. The reason you'll have low platelet counts in your blood is that they're being used up in all the clots. TTP usually lasts for days, weeks, or even months. Without treatment, it can lead to brain damage, stroke, or death. Drug-induced thrombocytopenia (DIT) Medicines can cause low platelet count. This happens a lot, but doctors don't always realize a drug is why you have low platelet counts. More than 300 drugs can cause low platelets."", ""Usually you'll have this type of thrombocytopenia 1-2 weeks after you start a new drug. But certain drugs may cause it after you take it the first time. If a drug is causing your low platelet count, it usually will go away after you stop taking it. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) This type happens when you take a drug called heparin. Doctors use heparin to protect against blood clots when you're at risk for a dangerous clot due to surgery or another condition. It can happen when the drug makes your platelets clump up instead of staying in your blood. It usually happens 2-3 days after you take heparin the first time. Sometimes your immune system also plays a role. HIT is the most common type of DIT. It happens most often when you're in the hospital. Gestational thrombocytopenia This type is the most common cause of low platelets when you're pregnant. It's not clear why pregnancy causes low platelet counts. It happens most often late in pregnancy. It usually goes away after birth. But if you've had gestational thrombocytopenia with one pregnancy, it may come back if you get pregnant again."", ""Usually this type of thrombocytopenia doesn't lead to bleeding. But your doctor may want to order tests to make sure there isn't some other reason for your low platelet counts. Dilutional thrombocytopenia You can have low platelets after a major blood transfusion to replace more than all the blood you have in 24 hours. It happens when you've lost blood and platelets and then your blood is replaced with lots of red cells. If you have this, a doctor will decide if you need more platelets to get your count back up. Distributional thrombocytopenia This is the name for low platelet counts when your platelets get trapped in your spleen. Your spleen usually will have about 30% of your platelets in it. When your spleen is bigger than it should be, it can have up to 90% of your platelets. Pseudothrombocytopenia This type isn't thrombocytopenia at all. It happens when a problem with a blood test makes it look like your platelets are low when they really aren't. It usually isn't a problem, but it could be if you get more testing or treatment you don't need."", 'Thrombocytopenia Diagnosis Thrombocytopenia is often found by chance when your doctor does a routine blood test. They might ask you questions to find out why your platelet counts are low and what type of thrombocytopenia you have. Some questions your doctor may ask include: What symptoms (including bleeding) have you noticed? When did you first see them? Does anything make them better? Or worse? What medications and supplements are you taking? Have you had any shots in the last month, a blood transfusion, or used drugs with a needle? Does anyone in your family have a problem with their immune system, bleeding, or bruising? What have you eaten recently? Some tests check for low platelet counts or other things that may lead to low platelets: Blood test. A complete blood count (CBC) looks at the amount of red and white blood cells and platelets in your blood. Blood smear . This shows how your platelets look under a microscope. Bone marrow test . Your bone marrow is where new blood cells get made. Your doctor uses a very fine needle to draw a small amount of liquid bone marrow and check it for cells that may not be working right. Or you may get a biopsy, using a different kind of needle, so your doctor can check the types and numbers of cells in the bone marrow. Blood clot test. This test measures how long it takes your blood to clot. It tells you how your platelets are working. Platelet antibody test. This test will see if antibodies in your blood are attacking your platelets. If you have platelet antibodies in your blood, it means your low platelets are caused by ITP. Your doctor may do a physical exam to check you for signs of internal bleeding and feel if your spleen seems big. They may order an abdominal ultrasound to look for changes in your liver, spleen, or lymph nodes. You may also need genetic or other tests to help your doctor figure out why your platelets are low.', ""How Serious Is Thrombocytopenia? For most people, having a low platelet count isn't a big problem. But if you have a severe form, you can bleed even when you aren't hurt in your eyes, gums, or bladder. You also could bleed too much when you’re hurt. You could bleed even with no injury at all.Trombocytopenia can be fatal, especially if you bleed a lot or bleed in your brain. Thrombocytopenia Complications Life-threatening hemorrhage or internal bleeding. You'll get this when you have a platelet lab value under 20,000. When your platelets are this low, it can cause sudden bleeds, including brain hemorrhage, even when you don't have an injury. Strokes. If your blood clots too much despite your low platelets, you may have a stroke. Heart attack. You can have a heart attack if low platelets causes less blood to flow to your heart.

Some treatment options for low platelets include: Blood or platelet transfusions. Your doctor can give you more blood or platelets to replace those you've lost. Medicines. You may need medication for thrombocytopenia if the problem is with your immune system. Steroids or other medicines that target your immune system may help to keep your antibodies from attacking your platelets. Surgery.

If it gets to an artery in your lungs and blocks blood flow, it’s called a pulmonary embolism, which can damage your lungs and cause death.\xa0This is what makes DVTs are more dangerous than superficial vein thrombosis. DVTs require blood thinners. Migratory thrombophlebitis. Also called Trousseau's syndrome or thrombophlebitis migrans, it's when the clot comes back in a different part of your body. It often goes from one leg to the other. It’s often linked to cancer, especially of the pancreas or lung."", 'What Are the Symptoms of Thrombophlebitis? If the blood flow to one of your veins is slowed because of a clot, you might have: Red, swollen, and irritated skin around the affected area Pain or tenderness that gets worse when you put pressure on the affected area A swollen vein that feels like a tough ""cord"" under your skin Pain when flexing your ankle (keep in mind that thrombophlebitis can happen in other parts of the body, but it usually happens in the legs) A swollen foot or ankle', 'If you have any of these symptoms, see your doctor right away. Call 911 if you have leg pain or swelling or any of the following symptoms: One leg seems warmer than the other or is swollen, red, painful, or irritated The affected limb becomes pale or cold, or you start feeling chills and fever Sudden coughing, which may bring up blood Sharp chest pain or chest tightness Pain in your shoulder, arm, back, or jaw Rapid breathing or shortness of breath Pain when you breathe Severe lightheadedness Fast heartbeat', 'What Causes It? First, a blood clot forms. This can be due to several things. Most often, it’s caused by blood not moving the way it should through the leg veins. This can happen because of: Long-term bed rest, such as after a major illness or surgery. Sitting for a long time, as you would in a car, on a plane, or in some other place where you can’t stretch your legs. Varicose veins. They cause your blood vessels to stretch too much. This allows blood to pool in the vessel instead of flowing straight through in one direction. This can lead to blood clots .', 'Who’s at Risk? Anyone who has poor circulation in their legs may be more likely to have this condition. This could include women who may get thrombophlebitis during or after pregnancy. People who’ve been kept in the hospital on an IV are at risk, too. Hospital staffers try to lower this risk by changing the spots where IV lines are placed in the body. Other things that raise your chances of having this condition include: Certain cancers Use of the hormone estrogen for birth control or hormone replacement Being over age 60 Obesity Smoking A family or personal history of blood clots Catheters placed in central veins of the arm or leg Anyone who has a hypercoagulable state if you have had trauma Are immoboloized Have had surgery and are immobolized', 'How Is It Diagnosed? The doctor will start by asking about your symptoms and taking a look at veins near the surface of your skin. They’ll do a physical exam. They may also do blood and circulation tests or imaging exams like a CT scan or MRI. They might also do tests like:', 'Duplex ultrasound. This painless imaging test doesn’t have radiation the way an X-ray does. It uses sound waves to create a picture of your legs. The doctor spreads warm gel on your skin and then rubs a wand over the area where they think the clot is. The wand sends sound waves into your body. The echoes go to a computer, which makes pictures of your blood vessels and sometimes the blood clots. A radiologist will review the images and send a report to your primary care doctor or to the doctor who requested the ultrasound. D-dimer test. This is a blood test to look for a protein, called D-dimer, that’s made when a blood clot breaks down. Your doctor will order this test if they think you’ve got a dangerous clot, like a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE).', 'If your D-dimer level is high, it could mean a clot is breaking down. If your results are negative, it means you probably don’t have a clot. But even if the results are positive, that still doesn’t mean you have a clot. Your doctor will need to order imaging studies to visualize the clot. MR Venography and CT Venography. If the results of your ultrasound aren’t clear, your doctor will use these\xa0imaging\xa0studies to confirm the presence of a clot. They will inject a dye into your vein and the image will show up on an X-ray. Possible side effects include pain and an allergic reaction to the dye. MR angiography (MRA). This test takes a detailed picture of your veins using a large MRI machine . Your doctor will inject a special dye into your veins. It’ll allow them to see your blood vessels. They’ll also be able to see anything that looks unusual, like plaque buildup in your arteries. CT scan. If your doctor is concerned that a deep vein clot has moved to your lung, they might order this test to get a better image.', 'How Is Thrombophlebitis Treated? Most cases of thrombophlebitis that happen in the shallow veins begin to go away by themselves in a week or two. But on rare occasions, these blocked veins can lead to infection. They can even cause tissue damage from the loss of healthy circulation. If you need treatment, your doctor will probably give you something to relieve swelling and pain. They may recommend that you keep your leg raised or take over-the-counter aspirin or ibuprofen. They might also suggest you apply heat to the affected leg or arm for 15 to 30 minutes, two to three times daily. Antibiotics. You might get them if poor circulation leads to an infection. Blood thinners. These medications are usually reserved for thrombosis with a high risk of embolization to the lungs or brain. Deep vein thrombosis requires anticoagulation for this reason. You can give yourself heparin and enoxaparin (Lovenox) at home through shots under your skin. They help keep the clot from getting bigger. You may also have to take an oral drug like warfarin (Coumadin) for several months or longer to keep clots from coming back. Your doctor will give you regular blood tests to make sure the meds are working.', 'Blood thinners , like direct thrombin inhibitors and factor Xa inhibitors, are also available. But doctors don’t normally recommend them as the main treatment for thrombophlebitis because they cost more and may cause uncontrollable bleeding. They include apixaban (Eliquis), dabigatran (Pradaxa), edoxaban (Savaysa), and rivaroxaban (Xarelto). Compression stockings. After the clot has resolved and you are on blood thinners, you may be advised to wear a compression stocking on the leg that was affected. This reduces the risk of post-thrombotic or post-phlebitic syndrome. They decrease swelling of the leg which decreases pressure in the veins and reduces risk of varicose veins.. Filter. This has much more limited use than suggested here. An IVC filter is used on people who can not safely take anticoagulation and are at risk for DVTs which put the person at risk for\xa0pulmonary embolism. The vena cava is the main vein in your abdomen. The IVC filter prevents clots in your legs from breaking loose and traveling to your lungs. You’ll need surgery for this treatment.\xa0They are ideally removed within\xa0 3 months after placement. Varicose vein stripping. This can help with veins that cause pain or recurring thrombophlebitis. The doctor makes small cuts to remove a long vein. It doesn’t affect circulation. Veins deeper down can handle more blood.', 'Complications They’re rare, but you could have: Pulmonary embolism. If the clot breaks loose, it could move to your lungs and block an artery. This condition can be life-threatening. Postphlebitic syndrome. It can show up months or years after DVT. It often causes pain, swelling, and a feeling of heaviness in the affected leg or arm. You might hear it called post-thrombotic syndrome , venous stasis syndrome, or chronic venous insufficiency.', 'Can It Be Prevented? Sitting on long drives or flights is a major cause of blood clots. To prevent them: Walk around. Get up for a stroll every hour. Keep moving. Don’t just sit there. Flex your ankles. Or press your feet against the floor or footrest about 10 times an hour. Keep it loose. Don’t wear tight clothing. Stay hydrated. Drink plenty of fluids, but avoid alcohol . Blood thinners . If you have had a clot previously\xa0or are at high risk for one, blood thinners may be prescribed prophylactically.']"
29,Ulcerative Colitis Treatment,"[""How Is Ulcerative Colitis Treated? Treatment for ulcerative colitis can include medicine, changes in your diet, or surgery. These treatments won't cure your ulcerative colitis, unless you have surgery that removes the colon and rectum, which is considered curative, but they can help ease your symptoms. It's important to get treated for ulcerative colitis as soon as you start having symptoms. If you have severe diarrhea and bleeding, you might need to go the hospital to prevent or treat dehydration , reduce your symptoms, and make sure you're getting the right nutrition ."", ""Medications for Ulcerative Colitis Your doctor may suggest several types of medicines to curb inflammation in your bowel, including sulfa drugs, corticosteroids, immunosuppressive agents, and antibiotics . 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA). Balsalazide , mesalamine , olsalazine , and sulfasalazine are the main medications used to treat ulcerative colitis. They come in pills and suppositories . Let your doctor know if you are allergic to sulfa before taking one of these drugs. They can prescribe a sulfa-free 5-ASA. Corticosteroids. These anti-inflammatory drugs can be used if 5-ASA drugs don't work for you or if you have a more severe disease. These medicines sometimes have side effects and long-term complications, so doctors often suggest them for short periods of time to help you get in remission. Your doctor may then prescribe you a 5-ASA medication to keep your symptoms away for a longer period. Immunosuppressants. If corticosteroids or 5-ASA drugs don't help, your doctor may prescribe these kinds of drugs, such as 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), azathioprine ( Azasan , Imuran ), cyclosporine , and tacrolimus ( Astagraf XL , Envarsus XR , Prograf ). Biologics. This group of drugs includes adalimumab ( Humira ), plus adalimumab-atto (Amjevita) and adalimumab -adbm (Cyltezo), which are biosimilars to Humira; certolizumab pegol ( Cimzia ), golimumab ( Simponi , Simponi Aria ), infliximab ( Remicade ), infliximab-abda ( Renflexis ), infliximab-axxq ( Avsola ), infliximab-dyyb ( Inflectra ), a biosimilar to Remicade , infliximab-qbtx (IXIFI), ustekinumab ( Stelara ), and vedolizumab ( Entyvio ). Janus kinase inhibitors ( JAK inhibitors ) . These are oral medicines that can work quickly to get and maintain a remission in ulcerative colitis. Tofacitinib ( Xeljanz ) is the first JAK inhibitor that is FDA-approved for the treatment of ulcerative colitis. Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulators . Ozanimod (Zeposia) is an oral medication and\xa0is the first\xa0 sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator approved for patients with moderately to severely active UC. Newer medications being studied include a group called sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulators. These can be taken by mouth. Researchers think they may get around the anti-drug antibodies that sometimes form with medications given as a shot. Antibodies are proteins that cancel out viruses, bacteria, and other things your body doesn’t recognize ."", ""Diet Changes for Ulcerative Colitis While food doesn't appear to play a role in causing ulcerative colitis, certain foods may cause more symptoms when your disease is active. Your doctor may suggest diet changes, depending on your symptoms. They may also recommend vitamins or nutritional supplements . DID YOU KNOW Newer medications being studied include a group called sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulators."", ""Surgery for Ulcerative Colitis Some people get surgery to remove part or all of the colon. Your doctor may suggest this if your medicine isn't working, your symptoms get worse, or your ulcerative colitis leads to serious complications. When you have an operation to remove your entire colon, the surgeon most often creates an opening, or stoma, in your belly wall. They attach a bag there and bring the tip of your lower small intestine through the opening. Waste passes through it and collects in a pouch, which gets attached to the stoma. You'd need to wear the pouch all the time. A newer surgery, called a pelvic pouch or ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA), doesn't create a permanent opening. Instead, a surgeon removes your colon and rectum, and your small intestine is used to form an internal pouch or reservoir that serves as a new rectum. This pouch is connected to the anus ."", ""A procedure called a continent ileostomy (Kock pouch) is done if you want your external pouch converted to an internal one, or if you can't get the IPAA operation. In this procedure, there is a stoma but no bag. Your surgeon removes your colon and rectum and creates an internal reservoir from your small intestine. They make an opening in your belly wall and join the reservoir to your skin with a nipple valve. To drain the pouch, you insert a catheter through the valve into the internal reservoir. Other techniques are also available. All surgeries carry some risk and complications. If you have been told you need surgery to treat ulcerative colitis, you may want to get a second opinion to make sure you get the best option for you."", 'When Should I Call My Doctor About Ulcerative Colitis? Call your doctor right away if you have: Heavy, persistent diarrhea Rectal bleeding with clots of blood in your stool Constant pain and a high fever', 'Complementary Treatments and Therapies You may consider these approaches in addition to what your doctor prescribes. But it’s important to talk to your medical team about any and all of them because some, like supplements, can interfere with treatments from your doctor. Let’s take a look at a few: Mind-body therapies: Stress and anxiety are well-known triggers for many people with ulcerative colitis, so it is not surprising that mind-body relaxation techniques could help. These techniques help nurture a healthy connection between your mind and body as well as between you and the outside world. In some cases, they encourage behavior changes in your everyday life. They may be worthwhile if only to lessen anxiety and depression linked to UC and improve quality of life. In addition, there is some evidence that yoga , meditation , and gut-centered hypnotherapy could help with some physical symptoms or flare-ups of UC. Some of the techniques, like cognitive behavioral therapy (a type of psychotherapy ) and patient support groups, have been so successful that they have slowly become a part of mainstream treatment for IBD .', ""Vitamins and supplements: Many people with ulcerative colitis may not absorb enough of some vitamins or minerals from food because of their disease. In these cases, your doctor may suggest taking certain supplements. Still, it’s important to speak with your doctor before you decide to take any on your own. Many of these substances can be unsafe, particularly if you have UC and you’re taking other medicines. Some people also take certain supplements in the belief that they help control UC symptoms. These might include: Fish oil : In foods, the omega-3 fatty acids found in fish , walnuts, flaxseed , and vegetable oils are good for your health. They lessen inflammation and help protect the heart , among other benefits. Some people with UC take omega-3 supplements in the form of fish oil capsules to lessen gut inflammation. Research has so far been unclear on whether this works. Too much fish oil may be bad for you and could be dangerous if you take it with blood thinners like warfarin ( Coumadin ). Turmeric: This spice, commonly used in Indian and South Asian cooking, has a chemical called curcumin that may help lessen inflammation in some people. Some small studies show that it could help with UC flare-ups in capsule form, but scientists need to do more research to be sure of these results. Also, many of the studies used very pure curcumin compounds that may not be available in retail brands. Curcumin can also have side effects that include bloating , nausea , and diarrhea. It also thins the blood and has not been tested for safety in pregnant women. Probiotics : These are “good” bacteria found in many foods that add to the healthy balance of bacteria in your gut. In supplement form, some studies suggest they could help bring a UC flare-up to an end and keep it there, especially if you have a pouch (from J-pouch surgery) that is inflamed. Still, it’s important to take care. There are a wide variety of probiotic products on the market, and much more study is needed. Keep in mind that the FDA doesn't regulate supplements, so claims on packaging may not be accurate. That’s yet another reason why it’s important to talk to your doctor before you start taking any supplements for your UC.""]"

31,Pros and Cons of Using a Pacifier,"[""For many parents, a pacifier tops the list of must-have items for a new baby. Babies naturally have the desire to suck, since it's the motion they use for nursing or taking a bottle. A pacifier does exactly what the name implies – it serves to pacify and comfort your baby. But how much should your baby depend on a pacifier – and is it safe at all? Here’s a breakdown of the pros and cons of pacifiers and their safety concerns."", ""Pros of Using a Pacifier Pacifiers are popular for a few reasons. They: Offer comfort. Everything is new to your baby, and that can overwhelm them at times. A pacifier offers your baby the chance to suckle, one of the first self-soothing tools they may learn. Help with feeding. Premature babies (those born before their due date) need oral stimulation to help improve breastfeeding and bottle feeding skills. Giving a pacifier to babies who aren't yet breastfeeding or bottle feeding benefits their development. Lower the chance of SIDS. SIDS (sudden infant death syndrome) is the leading cause of death in babies under 1 year of age. Studies have shown that using a pacifier reduces the risk of SIDS during sleep."", ""Help your baby fall asleep. While a pacifier may not improve the quality of your baby's sleep, it may help them fall asleep faster. Whether bottle-fed or breastfed, your baby has a natural desire to suck. Breastfeeding infants often want to nurse when falling asleep because it's comforting. Offering a pacifier may allow you to lay your baby down to fall asleep alone without rocking or nursing for comfort. If your baby’s pacifier falls out during sleep, you don’t have to put it back in their mouth unless they wake up crying for it. Ease pain. Pacifiers can help soothe pain for your baby during minor procedures such as having blood drawn. One study of babies who had their blood drawn found that they had less pain while sucking a pacifier vs. drinking a sugary drink. Can be a short-term habit. Unlike thumb sucking, sucking on a pacifier is an easier habit to break."", ""Cons of Using a Pacifier While a pacifier offers your baby some much needed comfort, there are some downsides to relying on one: Nipple confusion. If you choose to breastfeed, it's important to wait to introduce a pacifier until nursing is well established. Your baby uses a different suckling technique when using a pacifier or bottle vs. nursing at the breast. Suckling on the pacifier is much easier than breastfeeding, which requires more effort and a particular technique to draw milk from the breast. If you introduce a pacifier too soon, your baby may turn away from nursing because of the effort it requires. Habit-forming. Your baby may grow to rely on the pacifier to stay asleep. If it falls out of their mouth in the middle of the night, they may wake up crying. You might get less sleep because you keep getting up to give your baby the pacifier. Dental development. Most babies don’t have teeth yet, but the use of a pacifier can impact the spacing and straightness of their teeth once they do begin to come in. If you can, plan for your baby to stop using a pacifier before it has too much of an impact on their teeth. While some babies are born with their first teeth, most start teething around 6 months."", ""If your baby develops an overbite as a result of pacifier use, you may need to invest in braces later on. Some babies will suck their thumb if a pacifier isn’t available, which has similar impacts on their teeth. Higher chance of ear infections. Studies have shown that children who go without pacifiers have 33% fewer ear infections than kids who do. Too much pacifier sucking causes the tubes in your baby's ears to open more than they should. When these tubes are open, they allow bacteria in secretions from the throat to get into the ear, causing an ear infection. Babies who get more than two ear infections in a year might have trouble forming words and understanding sounds. Choking. Be sure to choose a pacifier with a base that's at least an inch and a half across. This size prevents your baby from getting the pacifier stuck in their mouth or throat. Also, look for a pacifier that has ventilation holes in the base just in case it ever gets trapped in your baby's mouth. Make sure the pacifier is one complete piece. If your baby sucks hard enough on a two-piece pacifier, it may come apart and pose a choking risk. Since pacifiers get worn down over time, make sure you check them regularly and buy more as needed. If the pacifier material becomes weak and breaks off, your baby could swallow a piece of it."", 'Safe Pacifier Use If you decide to use a pacifier with your baby, here are some tips to help you avoid the pitfalls: Best way to introduce a pacifier. When you\'re ready to introduce the pacifier, try doing the following: Make sure you use the right-sized pacifier. There are two sizes, one for newborn babies through 6 months old, and the other for kids 6 months and older. If your baby resists taking a pacifier, wait until they\'re in a better mood. As they get older, babies learn to self-soothe in other ways, like the use of white noise and a consistent sleep routine. Use a one-piece pacifier. Choose a pacifier that\'s a single piece and dishwasher safe. A two-piece pacifier may come apart and be a choking hazard. Clean it often. Make it a habit to boil your baby\'s pacifier or run it through the dishwasher often to sterilize it. Once your baby\'s immune system matures (usually around 6 months in full-term babies), you can wash it with soap and water. But don\'t ""wash"" the pacifier by sticking it in your mouth first. Doing this will only spread more germs.', ""Don't use a pacifier with a hungry baby. You don't want a pacifier to interfere with your baby's nutrition, so only use a pacifier when your baby isn't hungry. Avoid cords or strings. Never place a pacifier on a cord or string around your baby's neck. This is a choking hazard. Know when to stop. As your baby ages, the cons of using a pacifier outweigh the pros. Try phasing the pacifiers out after 6 months. Many children will stop using a pacifier on their own between the ages of 2 and 4. But if your baby has trouble giving up the pacifier when it's time, talk to their doctor or dentist about it."", ""Breaking the Pacifier Habit Many children will give up their pacifiers easily with a little coaxing. Follow these tips for an easy transition: Avoid using harsh words or teasing that can upset your child. There's no need to bully or punish them to break this habit. Once you begin trying to break the habit of using a pacifier, praise your baby's efforts. Start a sticker chart to track your baby's progress. If your child goes from a pacifier to using their fingers for sucking, distract them or keep their hands busy throughout the day.""]"
32,What Is Thyroid Cancer?,"['Your thyroid is shaped like a small butterfly, and is usually found inside the lower front of your neck. It’s a gland that controls your metabolism.

If you have thyroid cancer, you probably have this type. It’s found in up to 80% of all thyroid cancer cases. It tends to grow slowly, but often spreads to the lymph nodes in your neck. Even so, you have a good chance for a full recovery. Follicular thyroid cancer makes up between 10% and 15% of all thyroid cancers in the United States. It can spread into your lymph nodes and is also more likely to spread into your blood vessels.', 'Medullary cancer is found in about 4% of all thyroid cancer cases. It’s more likely to be found at an early stage because it produces a hormone called calcitonin, which doctors keep an eye out for in blood test results. Anaplastic thyroid cancer can be the most severe type, because it’s aggressive in spreading to other parts of the body .

But as it grows, you could notice any of the following problems: Neck, throat pain Lump in your neck Difficulty swallowing Vocal changes, hoarseness Cough', 'What Causes It? There is no clear reason why most people get thyroid cancer. There are certain things, though, that can raise your odds of getting it.', 'Inherited genetic syndromes. Some conditions, including cancer, come from the DNA you get from your parents. In 2\xa0out of 10 cases of medullary thyroid cancer, for example, the cancer is a result of an abnormal gene you’ve inherited. Iodine deficiency. If you don’t get much of this chemical element in your diet, you could be at more risk for certain types of thyroid cancer. This is rare in the United States because iodine is added to salt and other foods. Radiation exposure . If your head or neck was\xa0exposed to radiation treatment as a child.', 'Who Gets It? Thyroid cancer is more common in women than men. Women tend to get thyroid cancer in their 40s and 50s, while men who get it are usually in their 60s or 70s.

Papillary thyroid cancer, for example, happens most often in people between ages 30 and 50.', 'Is It Treatable? Thyroid cancer is usually very treatable, even if you have a more advanced stage of it. That’s because there are effective treatments that give you a great chance for a full recovery. And surgery, when it’s needed, can sometimes cure it.']"
33,Thyroid Problems,"[""What Is Thyroid Disease? What does your thyroid do? Your thyroid gland influences almost all of the metabolic processes in your body through the hormones it produces. Your thyroid gland is part of your endocrine system. When y our thyroid makes either too much or too little of important hormones, it’s called thyroid disease. Thyroid disease and disorders can range from a small, harmless goiter (enlarged gland) that needs no treatment, to life-threatening cancer. The most common thyroid problems involve abnormal production of thyroid hormones. Too much thyroid hormone results in a condition known as hyperthyroidism, while inadequate hormone production leads to hypothyroidism. Although the effects can be unpleasant or uncomfortable, most thyroid problems can be managed well if properly diagnosed and treated. Where is your thyroid located? It's at the front of your neck, under your skin. Your thyroid is small and butterfly-shaped."", 'Thyroid Disease Types and Causes There are two main types of thyroid disease: hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism. Both conditions can be caused by other diseases that impact the way the thyroid gland works.', ""Hyperthyroidism vs. hypothyroidism All types of hyperthyroidism are due to an overproduction of thyroid hormones, but the condition can occur in several ways: Graves' disease : The production of too much thyroid hormone. Toxic adenomas : Nodules that form in the thyroid gland and upset the body’s chemical balance by making thyroid hormones. Some goiters may contain several of these nodules. Subacute thyroiditis : Inflammation of the thyroid that causes the gland to “leak” excess hormones. This leads to temporary hyperthyroidism that generally lasts a few weeks but may persist for months. Pituitary gland malfunctions or cancerous growths in the thyroid gland : In rare cases, these can cause hyperthyroidism. Your thyroid gland is part of your endocrine system. Hypothyroidism , by contrast, stems from an underproduction of thyroid hormones. As your body needs certain amounts of thyroid hormones to make energy, a drop in hormone production leads to lower energy levels. Causes of hypothyroidism include: Hashimoto's thyroiditis : In this autoimmune disorder, the body attacks thyroid tissue. The tissue eventually dies and stops producing hormones. Postpartum thyroiditis: This can happen anytime in the year after you give birth, or have a miscarriage or abortion. It's not common, occurring in 5% to 9% of those situations. It’s usually a temporary condition. Iodine deficiency : Iodine is used by the thyroid to produce hormones. An iodine deficiency is an issue that affects several million people around the world. Removal of your thyroid gland : Your thyroid may have been surgically removed or chemically destroyed. Exposure to excessive amounts of iodine : Cold and sinus medicines, the heart medicine amiodarone, or certain contrast dyes given before some X-rays may expose you to too much iodine. Past thyroid issues: You may be at greater risk for hypothyroidism if you have had thyroid problems in the past. Lithium: This drug is also linked to hypothyroidism."", ""If hypothyroidism is left untreated, it can bring on myxedema coma , a rare but potentially fatal condition that requires hormone treatment right away. Hypothyroidism poses a special danger to newborns and infants. A lack of thyroid hormones in the system at an early age can cause intellectual disability and dwarfism (stunted growth). Doctors now regularly check the thyroid levels of most babies soon after birth. If the levels are low, treatment starts right away. The causes of hypothyroidism in babies and adults are the same: A pituitary disorder A defective thyroid A missing thyroid gland Cancer of the thyroid gland is rare and occurs in about 5% of thyroid nodules. You might have one or more thyroid nodules for several years before your doctor finds that they're cancerous. If you've had radiation treatment to your head and neck earlier in life, possibly as a remedy for acne, you may have a higher risk of getting thyroid cancer."", 'Risk Factors for Thyroid Problems Anyone can have thyroid problems, and thyroid disease is common. Women are five to eight times more likely than men to be diagnosed with thyroid issues. You also have a higher risk for them if you: Have a family history of thyroid problems. Have pernicious anemia, type 1 diabetes, primary adrenal insufficiency, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjögren’s syndrome, or Turner syndrome. Take meds that have iodine. Are 60 or older. Had a previous thyroid condition or cancer (thyroidectomy or radiation).', 'Thyroid Disease Symptoms Symptoms of hyperthyroidism include: sweating irregular heartbeat weight loss protruding eyes nervousness Symptoms of hypothyroidism include: tiredness weight gain depression abnormal bone development stunted growth An infant with hypothyroidism may be inactive and quiet, have a poor appetite, and sleep for long periods. Early signs of thyroid disease include changes in your: tolerance for hot or cold temps menstrual cycle energy level or mood weight If you or your child have one or more of these symptoms, contact a doctor.', ""Weight gain in hypothyroidism isn't uncommon, but it's usually only 5 to 10 pounds. Large weight gain is rare and associated with severe hypothyroidism. If your only symptom is weight gain , you probably have something other than a thyroid problem. How do thyroid problems affect your body? Thyroid disorders can affect your heart rate, mood, energy level, metabolism, bone health, and pregnancy, along with many other body functions ."", ""Thyroid Disease Diagnosis Thyroid disease can be tricky to diagnose. That's because its symptoms can look like those of other conditions. For example, thyroid disease symptoms could be similar to those you might have during pregnancy. These tests help your doctor know if you have a thyroid issue: Blood tests. O ne of the surest ways to diagnose a thyroid problem, these tests measure the amount of thyroid hormones in your blood. They're done by taking blood from a vein in your arm. Imaging tests. Looking at your thyroid might answer a lot of questions. Your doctor might do an imaging test called a thyroid scan . This lets them check the thyroid for an increased size, shape, or presence of growths (nodules)."", ""They also might do an ultrasound. This transmits high-frequency sound waves, which you can't hear, through your body. Echoes are recorded and transformed into video or photographic images. It takes 20-30 minutes. Physical exams. Done in your doctor's office, this is a simple and painless test where your doctor feels your neck for any growths or enlargement of the thyroid. Iodine uptake tests . If you have hypothyroidism, your doctor might do this test to find what's causing it. This tracks the amount of iodine absorbed by your thyroid gland. You get iodine from the foods you eat. It's a key ingredient of thyroid hormone, so the amount of iodine your thyroid absorbs is a good way to tell how much hormone your gland is making."", 'How to check your thyroid at home Get a mirror and a glass of water. Follow these steps: Locate your thyroid on the front of your neck, between your collarbone and Adam’s apple. Tip your head back while looking in a mirror. Take a drink of water while your head is tilted back. Watch your thyroid as you swallow. Look for lumps or bumps. You may be able to see them when you swallow the water. Repeat this test a few times. If you see any lumps or bumps, contact your doctor.', ""Thyroid Disease Treatment Your doctor can use different ways to restore your thyroid hormone levels to normal. Each treatment depends on the type and cause of your thyroid condition. Subacute thyroiditis treatment Although subacute thyroiditis can bring on temporary hyperthyroidism, this condition doesn't require medical treatment. You can take acetaminophen or aspirin for any pain from the inflamed thyroid. (Children under age 19 shouldn't take aspirin because it's been linked to Reye's syndrome.) If over-the-counter drugs don't help, your doctor may prescribe anti-inflammatory drugs, such as dexamethasone or prednisone, for a short time."", ""Hyperthyroidism treatment Thyroid hormone production can be slowed or stopped completely with: Radioactive iodine treatment Antithyroid medication Surgery If your doctor decides that radioactive treatment is best, you'll swallow a tablet or liquid with enough radioactive iodine to damage the cells of your thyroid gland so they can't make hormones. Sometimes you'll need more than one treatment to cut back hormone production to a normal level. Many people develop hypothyroidism as a result of this procedure. After you start using antithyroid medications , your symptoms should begin to disappear in about 6-8 weeks. But you'll typically need to keep taking the medication for about a year. At that time, your doctor will check to see if you can stop. You'll need regular checkups once you're off the medicine to make sure your hormone levels stay balanced. Doctors don't usually do surgery unless you're pregnant (and can’t take antithyroid medicine) or have a large goiter or cancerous nodule."", ""Hypothyroidism treatment Someone with hypothyroidism will have to take thyroid hormone replacement for the rest of their life. No surgery , drugs, or complementary medicine can boost your thyroid once it slows down. Doctors generally prescribe manmade forms of thyroid hormone, such as levothyroxine. Side effects are rare, but some people have nervousness or chest pain while taking these drugs. Adjusting the dose of medication usually gets rid of any unpleasant effects. Let your doctor know about everything you're taking because some things could affect how well the medication works: Diabetes Antidepressants Estrogen in hormone replacement therapy or birth control The blood-thinning drug warfarin The heart drug digitalis Supplements and products with magnesium, aluminum, iron, or soy Thyroid cancer treatment The first way to treat thyroid cancer is usually by removing either the cancerous tissue or the whole thyroid gland, a surgical procedure known as a thyroidectomy. If your cancer has spread, any other affected tissues, such as the lymph glands in your neck, will be removed, too."", ""Alternative Treatment for Thyroid Problems You might try other therapies to cleanse your body, restore immune function, and balance your production and release of hormones. Talk to your doctor if you're interested in these other methods to make sure they won't harm you or interfere with your treatment. A naturopath may use homeopathic mixtures, herbs, preparations based on traditional Chinese medicine (which links thyroid problems to emotional distress ), and acupuncture to remove blocks to your “life force energy.” Naturopaths are authorized to treat thyroid disease in some states, but in others, it's illegal. While they may help with the stress associated with thyroid disease, there are no good studies showing that these therapies are effective for treating thyroid disorders. Chiropractors use spinal manipulation to treat symptoms of thyroid disorders by easing muscle tension and improving blood circulation."", ""Thyroid Diet Protein, calcium, magnesium, and iodine help your thyroid work. Make sure you're getting plenty of all the B vitamins, vitamin A, and vitamin C. If you don't have enough iodine in your system , taking selenium can cause hypothyroidism. Avoid these products: Pseudoephedrine (found in over-the-counter cold remedies) can cause nervousness, insomnia, headache, and high blood pressure. Alkaloids, including caffeine, morphine, and quinine, can raise your blood pressure and heart rate."", ""Takeaways Your thyroid gland, part of your endocrine system, influences almost all of the metabolic processes in your body. When your thyroid gland produces too little or too much of important hormones, it's called thyroid disease. There are two main types of thyroid disease: hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism. Thyroid disease symptoms can mimic those of other conditions, sometimes making thyroid disease hard to diagnose. Treatment depends on your type and cause of thyroid disease ."", ""Thyroid Problem FAQs Is thyroid disease serious? That depends. Thyroid problems can range from harmless goiters requiring no treatment to thyroid cancer, which can be life-threatening. What happens if thyroid disease isn’t treated? You can develop complications that range from mild to deadly. Can an enlarged thyroid gland go back to normal on its own? It's possible, but you may need treatment. If you have symptoms, see your doctor to make sure you get treatment if needed.""]"
34,What Are Thyroid Nodules?,"['Thyroid nodules are solid or fluid-filled lumps or bumps. They’re found on your thyroid , a small, powerful gland in your neck. This gland makes thyroid hormone , which affects your metabolism (the internal process that turns your food into energy), heart rate , and many other systems in the body. Sometimes, cells in your thyroid can grow out of control and form a lump.', 'Are Thyroid Nodules Serious? Most often the answer is no. You usually can’t feel thyroid nodules. Even though they happen from an overgrowth of cells, most thyroid nodules aren’t cancer. About 1 in 10 thyroid nodules turn out to be cancer. Benign (noncancerous) thyroid nodules are common. Lots of people get them as they get older. If a thyroid nodule isn’t cancerous,\xa0 it may not need any treatment. Doctors might just watch to make sure it doesn’t keep growing or begin to cause other problems.', 'Types of Thyroid Nodules There are different types of thyroid nodules that aren’t cancerous: Toxic nodules make too much thyroid hormone. This can lead to hyperthyroidism, which makes the metabolism speed up. Multinodular goiters have several nodules. They may also make too much thyroid hormone and may press on other structures. Thyroid cysts are full of fluid, sometimes with other debris. They may happen after an injury.', 'Symptoms of Thyroid Nodules Thyroid nodules usually don’t have symptoms. If they are large, they may cause: Trouble breathing Trouble swallowing A throat “tickle” Hoarseness or voice change When a nodule causes the thyroid to make too much hormone this is sometimes called a “hot nodule.” It may cause: Weight loss Muscle weakness Heat intolerance Anxiousness Irritability Irregular heartbeat Weak bones Sometimes people with thyroid nodules make too little thyroid hormone. This can cause symptoms of hypothyroidism: Fatigue Cold sensitivity Constipation Dry skin Weight gain Puffy face Hoarseness Muscle weakness High cholesterol Muscle aches or stiffness Joint pain, swelling, or stiffness Thinning hair Depression Memory loss', 'Causes of Thyroid Nodules It’s not always clear why a person gets thyroid nodules. Several medical conditions can cause them to form. They include: Thyroiditis : This is chronic inflammation of the thyroid. One type of thyroiditis is called Hashimoto ’s disease. It’s associated with low thyroid activity ( hypothyroidism ). Iodine deficiency: A diet that lacks iodine can result in thyroid nodules. This is uncommon in the U.S., since iodine is added to many foods. Thyroid adenoma: This is an unexplained overgrowth of thyroid tissue. Most adenomas are harmless, but some produce thyroid hormone. This leads to an overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism). Thyroid cancer : Most thyroid nodules aren’t cancer , but some can be.', 'Risk Factors for Thyroid Nodules Thyroid nodules are actually quite common. By the age of 60, half of all people have them. They’re often very small. You might only learn you have a thyroid nodule when your doctor feels for one during an examination or if you have an ultrasound of your thyroid. Still, several things can increase your chances of developing a thyroid nodule. They include: Living in a part of the world where the diet doesn’t include iodine Having a family history of thyroid nodules Being female Being older Having a history of radiation exposure to head or neck', 'Diagnosing Thyroid Nodules You may be able to identify one just by looking in the mirror. Face the mirror with your chin raised a little. Swallow and look for a bump on either side of your windpipe near your Adam’s apple. Put your fingers gently on your neck in that spot and feel for a bump. If you find one, ask your doctor about it. About 90% of thyroid nodules are benign (noncancerous). If you notice one, have your doctor check it. For problems with your thyroid, you may want to see a specialist called an endocrinologist. Endocrinologists specialize in health problems related to the glands that make hormones, including the thyroid. They will do a physical exam and might order one of the following tests to find out if it’s cancer or not: Blood test for thyroid hormones Ultrasound Fine-needle biopsy Thyroid scan With a biopsy, your doctor will insert a very fine needle into your thyroid nodule to collect a few cells. They’ll send them to a lab for further study. Noncancerous thyroid nodules can still be a problem if they grow too large and make it hard for you to breathe or swallow.', 'Treatment for Thyroid Nodules When a nodule is not cancerous, treatment may include: “Watchful waiting” Thyroid hormone therapy When nodules cause hyperthyroidism, treatment may include: Radioactive iodine Antithyroid medicines Beta blockers Surgery Any cancerous thyroid nodules should be removed surgically. The same is true for very large ones and those that change and develop strange features over time.']"
35,What Is Thyrotoxicosis?,"['Your thyroid gland (a small butterfly-shaped organ in the lower front of your neck) makes hormones that help your body use energy, stay warm, and keep your organs working the way they should. Thyrotoxicosis is when you have way too much of those hormones in your blood . This happens most often because your thyroid gland makes too much. That’s a condition called hyperthyroidism .', 'Causes Graves’ disease: This condition is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism -- and thyrotoxicosis. It leads your immune system to mistake the cells of your thyroid gland for invaders and attack them with antibodies (a type of protein). It’s not clear why this happens, but it makes the gland grow and make too much thyroid hormone. The condition tends to run in families, so your genes may play a part in whether you get it. Nodules: Growths called nodules can develop on your thyroid and affect how much hormone the gland makes. A single hyperfunctioning nodule is called toxic nodular adenoma., while multinodular goiter or Plummer’s disease means you have a number of them.', 'Struma ovarii: This is a rare type of ovarian tumor that’s made mostly of thyroid tissue. In some cases, it can cause hyperthyroidism. Thyroiditis: A virus or bacteria, certain medications (like lithium ), or even your own immune system can inflame your thyroid gland and make it release too much hormone into your bloodstream. Thyroid supplement: Some people take thyroid hormone in pill form to treat a medical condition, like hypothyroidism (when your thyroid doesn’t make enough hormone). You can have too much in your blood if your prescription is off or you don’t take the medication as directed.', 'Symptoms Normally, thyroid hormones help you burn energy at the right speed. High levels can affect your body in lots of different ways. In general, they speed things up -- like your heart , which often beats faster. You might poop and sweat more, feel irritable and nervous, and have shaky hands and weaker muscles. You may lose weight because you don’t eat enough calories to match your faster metabolism . Graves’ disease can also trigger thyroid eye disease with red, watery eyes that bulge out with swollen lids.', 'Diagnosis Your doctor will ask about your symptoms and medications you take, and check to see if your pulse is too fast or your thyroid is too big. After that, a simple blood test that measures the amount of thyroid stimulating hormone, or TSH, in your blood can help your doctor know for sure if you have thyrotoxicosis. You might need more blood tests to find the exact cause. In some cases, your doctor also may want to get a better look at your thyroid gland with an ultrasound . That’s a machine that uses sound waves to make images of the inside of your body.', 'Treatment For Graves’ disease and other types of hyperthyroidism, drugs called antithyroid agents can help keep the gland from making too much hormone. Radioactive iodine that’s usually swallowed in a capsule can destroy thyroid cells. This treatment may sound scary, but it has a long history and is generally safe and works well. Beta-blockers help ease certain symptoms, like a faster pulse and shaky hands, but don’t do anything to lower your hormone levels. In serious cases, you and your doctor may decide to remove part or all of your thyroid gland with surgery to ease your symptoms.', 'Thyrotoxicosis and Diabetes Symptoms of low blood sugar -- tremors and sweating -- can be easily confused with symptoms of high thyroid hormone levels. You may mistakenly think you have low blood sugar and eat extra food that makes your blood sugar spike. That can be bad for your health and mask your thyroid problems . The faster metabolism caused by thyrotoxicosis can affect your diabetes medicines and make them move more quickly through your system. That could mean your normal dosage of insulin or other medicine won’t be enough to control your blood sugar. Your doctor can help you manage this.']"
36,What Is a TIA?,"['What Is Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA)? It\'s similar to a stoke. Your blood delivers oxygen to every part of your body. Your cells need it to survive. If your blood flow gets blocked anywhere, one of the many issues that can happen is a TIA. When you have a TIA, the flow of blood to part of your brain gets cut off for a short time. It\'s also called a ministroke, but don\'t let the ""mini"" part fool you. A TIA can be a sign that a full-blown stroke is on the way. About 1 in 3 people who have a TIA go on to have a stroke , often within a year.', ""TIA Symptoms The symptoms of a TIA can happen suddenly. They're similar to early stroke symptoms. They include: Droopy face. Your eyes or mouth may droop on one side. You may also have trouble smiling. Speaking problems. Your speech may be slurred, garbled, or hard to understand. It might be difficult to find the right words."", ""Weak or numb arms. You may have trouble lifting and holding up both arms. Those are the clearest red flags, but you may also notice: Balance and coordination problems Blindness or blurred vision in one or both eyes Not being able to move one side of your body Confusion and a hard time understanding others Dizziness A sudden, severe headache Trouble swallowing You can have more than one TIA. Each TIA can have different symptoms, based on which part of your brain is affected. Post-TIA symptoms After a TIA, you might notice some long-term effects. Since these could affect your work or other daily activities, you may want to tell your employer and loved ones about it. TIA lasting affects can include: Fatigue. You can get very tired after a TIA. Fatigue is when your sleepiness is extreme but doesn't get better with rest. Emotional shifts. After you have a TIA, you might feel shocked or anxious about your well-being. It's important to talk to your friends and family about your anxiety, to help your overall mood. Sharing your feelings can help others better understand what you're going through. Regular exercise can also help get rid of some tension and boost your energy."", ""A need to focus more on your health. It's important to follow treatment advice from your doctor. You can choose healthy lifestyle habits. Eat healthy meals, quit smoking, and be more active. All of these things can help lower your risk of a stroke. If you continue to have physical, memory, or thinking troubles after a TIA, talk to your doctor."", 'TIA Causes A TIA can happen when a blood clot gets lodged in an artery that supplies blood to your brain . Without regular blood flow, your brain is starved for oxygen and can\'t work the way it normally does. That\'s why you get symptoms like muscle weakness or slurred speech with a TIA. It\'s like having a clogged fuel line in your car. Your engine can\'t run if it\'s not getting gas. Clots form when you have a buildup of a fatty, waxy substance called plaque in your arteries. They can take shape anywhere in your body, and float along until they get stuck somewhere. If that ""somewhere"" happens to be an artery that goes to your brain , you can have a TIA. You can also get a TIA if there\'s so much plaque in an artery that it severely limits blood flow to your brain, just like a clot.', ""TIA Diagnosis If you have symptoms of a TIA, it's important to see your doctor right away. A quick diagnosis is important, as it helps figure out what caused your TIA. It also allows your doctor to treat it properly. Your doctor might use: Physical and neurological exams. They'll test your vision, eye movement, speech, language, reflexes, strength, and sensory system. They might also listen to your carotid artery system through a stethoscope. They might look for other stroke risk factors like high cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes, or high homocysteine. Computerized tomography (CT) or computerized tomography angiography (CTA) scans. These help your doctor look at your brain, and at the arteries in your neck and brain. Carotid ultrasonography. If your doctor thinks your carotid artery caused your TIA, they'll use this tool to look closely at any narrowing or clotting in your neck. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). These help your doctor check your brain, arteries, and neck. Echocardiography. This tool allows your doctor to look clearly at possible causes, like blood clots, through an ultrasound image. Arteriography. This helps your doctor look at arteries in your brain that usually aren't seen on an X-ray."", ""TIA Treatment There are many ways to lower your risk of a stroke after a TIA. Your doctor will decide which is a best for you, based on your TIA type, cause, location, how serious it was, and findings on an MRI or CT scan. Immediate treatments include: Anti-platelet drugs, like acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) or clopidogrel (Plavix) Anticoagulant drugs, like warfarin (Jantoven) Surgery is another treatment for a TIA. If one of the carotid arteries in your neck is narrowed or blocked, you may need surgery to help clear it out and restore normal blood flow. One option is an operation called a carotid endarterectomy, where your doctor opens up your carotid artery , scrapes out the plaque, and closes it back up. Another choice is a procedure called carotid angioplasty and stenting. Your doctor makes a small opening in your groin. They'll use a balloon-like device to widen your carotid artery , then put in a small wire tube, called a stent , to keep it open. They then remove the balloon."", ""TIA Prevention To prevent a TIA, make these healthy lifestyle choices: Eat food that's good for you. Choose whole foods , meaning those that are as natural and unprocessed as possible. Also eat a low- fat , low-salt, high-fiber diet with plenty of fruits and veggies. Limit saturated fats and sugar , and avoid trans fats . Get a good night's sleep . Regular shut-eye can lower your risk of a stroke. Create a routine to relax at night and get to bed at a reasonable time. Limit alcohol . If you drink, keep it to one drink a day if you're female, or two if you're male. Manage your other health conditions. The more you control issues like high blood pressure , diabetes , and atrial fibrillation , the better. Stick to an exercise routine. Typically, you need at least 150 minutes of medium-level cardio , like brisk walking , each week. Check with your doctor to see what's safe for you. Stay at a healthy weight . This will help your blood pressure and cholesterol , too. Stop smoking . Tobacco harms your health in many ways, including raising your stroke risk."", ""Avoid illegal drugs . Drugs like amphetamines , cocaine , and heroin can raise your chances of a TIA or stroke. Along with other lifestyle changes, if you're a biological woman, you should take a few more steps to avoid a TIA or stroke. For instance, if you're over age 75, ask your doctor to check you for atrial fibrillation. If you're pregnant , have your blood pressure checked regularly during and after pregnancy. If you think you might start birth control pills , get checked for high blood pressure first. If you get migraines with auras, it's even more important that you stop smoking right away."", ""TIA vs. Stroke TIAs are similar to ischemic strokes, which are also caused by blood clots . The main difference is that a TIA only lasts a few minutes. The clot then gets pushed along, like a temporary clog in a pipe, or chemicals in your body quickly break it down. Normal blood flow returns to your brain before lasting problems set in. Symptoms can last for up to 24 hours, but they're usually gone in an hour. Strokes, on the other hand, don't go away so quickly. That means some part of your brain goes without oxygen, and the longer that lasts, the more damage happens. While a TIA comes on, goes away, and leaves no symptoms, a stroke can have long-lasting effects and can be life-threatening."", ""TIA Risk Factors A TIA can affect anyone. The same things that raise your odds of a stroke also affect your risk of a TIA, and there are a lot of issues in play. Risks you can't control. Some things you can't change, but it's helpful to be aware of them: Age . The odds of a TIA or stroke get much higher when you're over 55. After age 55, your risk for having a stroke doubles every 10 years. Family history . If one of your grandparents, parents, or a brother or sister had a stroke, you have a greater chance of getting a TIA. Previous TIA. Once you've had one, you're much more likely to get another. Race . African American people, as well as people who belong to South Asian and Caribbean ethnic groups, have a higher chance of a TIA than others. Gender. Women have a greater risk of strokes and TIAs than men."", 'Health conditions. Other medical problems you have can also increase the odds of a TIA, including: Being overweight Carotid artery disease , where the main arteries from your heart to your brain are narrowed or clogged Diabetes Heart disease , including heart defects and rhythm problems like atrial fibrillation ( AFib ) High blood pressure High cholesterol Peripheral artery disease (PAD), where arteries in your arms or legs get blocked Sickle cell disease , a genetic condition where misshaped blood cells can get wedged in arteries more easily COVID-19', ""Lifestyle. Some of the choices you make every day may affect your chances of having a TIA. You may have a higher risk if you: Drink a lot of alcohol Don't get enough exercise Eat too many foods high in cholesterol , saturated fats , and trans fats , and not enough fruits, veggies, and fiber Smoke Use drugs such as amphetamines , cocaine , and heroin Risks for women.

37,Tic Douloureux,"['Tic Douloureux Overview Tic douloureux or trigeminal neuralgia is a severe, stabbing pain to one side of the face. It stems from one or more branches of the nerve that supplies sensation to the face, the trigeminal nerve. It is considered one of the most painful conditions to affect people. The pain usually lasts from a few seconds to a few minutes. It may be so intense that you wince involuntarily, hence the term tic. There is usually no pain or numbness between attacks and no dysfunction of the muscles of the face. Most people feel the pain in their jaw, cheek, or lip on one side of the face only. Pain is usually triggered by a light touch of the face or mouth on the same side as the pain. The pain is so severe that people can become afraid to talk, eat, or move during periods of attacks. Although a flurry of attacks can last for weeks or months, there are usually periods of months or even years that are symptom-free. The pain of tic douloureux is usually controlled with medications or surgery. Tic douloureux is generally a disease of middle age or later life. Women are affected more often than men. People with multiple sclerosis are affected much more frequently than the general population.', 'Tic Douloureux Causes The cause of tic douloureux is unknown. There are a number of theories as to why the trigeminal nerve is affected. The most commonly accepted theory is compression of the trigeminal nerve, usually by a blood vessel, causing it to become irritated. This irritation causes the outer covering of the nerve (the myelin sheath) to erode over time. The irritated nerve then becomes more excitable and erratically fires pain impulses. Tumors and bony abnormalities of the skull may also press on and irritate the trigeminal nerve. In addition, trauma, infections, and multiple sclerosis can also damage the trigeminal nerve.', 'Tic Douloureux Symptoms The main symptom of tic douloureux is a sudden, severe, stabbing, sharp, shooting, electric-shock-like pain on one side of the face. Because the second and third divisions of the trigeminal nerve are the most commonly affected, the pain is usually felt in the lower half of the face.', 'The pain comes in intermittent episodes that last from a few seconds to a few minutes. There may be many episodes of pain each day. There is usually no pain between episodes.', 'The flurry of pain episodes may last from a few weeks to a few months, followed by pain-free periods of months to even years. Generally, the episodes become more frequent and more resistant to treatment with medications over time. The attacks of pain are often initiated by physical stimulation of a trigger point on the same side of the face as the pain. Trigger points can be anywhere on the face or in the mouth or nose. They are generally not in the same place as the pain. Stimuli that can initiate the pain include talking, eating, brushing the teeth , or even cool air on the face. There is no loss of taste, hearing, or sensation in someone suffering from tic douloureux.', ""When to Seek Medical Care Call your doctor when the prescribed medications are not controlling the pain, or if you develop new symptoms. Because tic douloureux is a pain-only syndrome, the development of new symptoms may warrant additional evaluation. Go to a hospital's emergency department if you experience symptoms such as fever, redness of your face, or dizziness . These symptoms may not be related to your condition and may signify another illness. If your prescribed medication is not relieving the pain and your doctor is not available for advice, go to the hospital."", 'Exams and Tests There is no single medical test to diagnose tic douloureux. The diagnosis is made based on the description of the pain, physical examination , and exclusion of other causes of facial pain. The pain is unique. A history of bursts of shooting pain in one side of the face along with a trigger zone will give the doctor good clues to the cause of your pain. The physical examination is normal in tic douloureux. If numbness, decreased hearing, dizziness, visual changes, or dysfunction of the muscles of the face is found, then other disorders may be considered. Additionally, other causes of facial pain such as a sinus infection , dental infection, or a jaw disorder, such as TMJ , can often be found by physical examination. Special X-ray images, such as a CT scan or MRI of the head, can look for other causes of facial pain. They can also help delineate blood vessels or tumors that might be pressing on the nerve and irritating it.', 'Tic Douloureux Treatment Self-Care at Home There are no effective home treatment remedies for tic douloureux. Treatment should be guided by a physician. The role of the doctor is to ensure the diagnosis, begin appropriate therapy, and coordinate any potential need for consultants. In most cases, effective treatment will require only medications. Uncommonly, surgery will be recommended. Medical Treatment The primary treatment of tic douloureux is medication to control the pain. Surgery may be necessary when drug therapy is not effective or side effects from the medications are not tolerable. Medications A number of medications can be effective in helping control the pain of tic douloureux. The most commonly prescribed medications are anticonvulsants ( seizure medications). Anticonvulsants help to stop the irritated trigeminal nerve from firing pain impulses. The most frequently prescribed anticonvulsant medication for tic douloureux is carbamazepine ( Tegretol ). Oxcarbazepine ( Trileptal ), gabapentin ( Neurontin) , and lamotrigine ( Lamictal ) may also be effective, These medications are generally started at a low dose and then increased until pain is controlled or side effects occur. Common side effects include drowsiness, dizziness, double vision , and nausea . Rarely, serious liver or bone marrow problems can occur. [ Baclofen ( Lioresal ), a muscle relaxant, may be useful for some people who either do not respond to anticonvulsants or who suffer serious side effects. An antipsychotic medicine pimozide ( Orap ) has been helpful in some cases as well. Opioid pain medications can be useful during episodes of severe pain. Botox injections have been shown to offer significant pain relief.', 'Medication is at least partly effective for most people who suffer with tic douloureux. For the rest, drug therapy either fails to provide adequate pain control or adverse side effects are intolerable. Unfortunately, many people who initially respond to anticonvulsants eventually develop resistance to the medications. Surgery When pain cannot be controlled with medication, surgical options should be discussed with a neurosurgeon. Surgery could range from simple injections of anesthetic into the trigeminal nerve to complex procedures that must be performed in the operating room. In general, the more complex procedures provide longer-lasting pain relief but with greater potential for more serious complications.', 'Next Steps Follow-up If you are diagnosed with tic douloureux, your doctor may refer you to a neurologist or neurosurgeon for management of the pain. Some of the medications used to treat tic douloureux may affect your blood counts and liver function , so it is important to have these levels monitored as instructed by your doctor. After surgery, watch for signs of infection such as redness, discharge, or fever.', 'Prevention Tic douloureux cannot be prevented.', 'Outlook Although pain from tic douloureux can go away without treatment for months to years, the disorder is usually progressive. Attacks can become more frequent over time. There are no long-term medical consequences of the disorder. Tic douloureux is purely a pain syndrome. The pain of tic douloureux can almost always be controlled with either medication or surgery. Most people with tic douloureux lead full, complete lives.', 'Synonyms and Keywords tic douloureux, trigeminal neuralgia, facial pain']"
38,Tick Bites,"[""A lot of bites from little critters looking for their next meal are no big deal. You get a small red bump, maybe it’s itchy, and you move on. But if you have a tick, you want to know about it. Ticks carry a lot of different diseases, some of them serious. Usually, early treatment is your key to a full and fast recovery. That means you need to know what to look for if a tick bites you. Tick bites don't always cause disease, but when they do, it can be serious. Photo: Moment/Getty Images"", 'How to Identify Tick Bites Ticks aren’t like bugs that bite you and then fly away or scoot off. When one gets on your body, it sets up camp. It finds a place to eat, then burrows its head into your skin and starts feeding. And it will stay there for several days. Most likely, you won’t feel anything because the bite doesn’t hurt, and it isn’t usually itchy. Because ticks are often very small, you might not see it either. At first, it might just look like a fleck of dirt. As it feeds though, it swells up and can be easier to find.', 'You might get a small red bump where the tick bites you. Some people’s bodies react to ticks with 1 to 2 inches of redness around the bite. That red area won’t get any bigger, unless it’s really a rash , which is a sign of disease. Ticks typically bite people in warm, moist, or hairy areas, like the: Scalp Skin behind the ear Armpit Groin Skin between your fingers and toes Once a tick finds a place to feed, it will stay there anywhere from a few days to 2 weeks. Ticks bite once and use that site to feed on your blood until they’re full. A tick will fall off on its own once it’s full. You won’t get multiple bites from a tick. Most tick bites are painless and cause only a minor reaction. Only sometimes do they transmit disease.', 'Tick Bite Symptoms Tick bites often cause a reaction on your skin, even when they’re not infected or disease-causing. Typical symptoms of a tick bite may include: A small hard bump or sore Redness Swelling', 'Unlike other bites, tick bites don’t usually have fluid or pus in them, unless they’re infected. Most diseases from ticks also give you flu-like symptoms, such as: Body aches Chills Feeling very tired A fever A headache With Lyme disease , you may also have joint pain . Only some diseases from ticks give you a rash. What it looks like depends on which kind you have. Lyme disease: Most people with Lyme disease get a rash, but not all of them. It shows up within 3-30 days after you were bitten, but it usually takes just over a week. You’ll see a round or oval area of redness around the bite. At first, it may look just like a reaction to the bite, but the rash gets bigger over days or even weeks. Typically, it reaches about 6 inches wide. It might feel warm, but it’s not usually painful or itchy. Most people think of the bull’s-eye rash when they hear about Lyme disease. That happens in less than half the cases, and it comes after the rash has been around for a while.', ""On lighter skin, the faint color and border of the rash might be more noticeable. But on darker skin, it may be less visible. You could also notice a crusted center within the rash. If you have darker skin, this may look like a deeper-colored patch of skin. On lighter skin, it may appear as a red scabby area. Lyme disease rashes can show up in different shapes and colors. Rashes on light skin tend to be redder and bluer, while rashes on dark skin may be a deeper blue or purple. But everyone's rash will look slightly different. Rocky Mountain spotted fever: Most people with RMSF get a rash 2-5 days after they first get symptoms. It won’t look the same on everyone, but it usually starts as small, flat, pink spots on your wrists and ankles . It spreads from there to the rest of your body. In about half the cases, the spots turn red or purple after about a week."", 'While the spots may be more noticeable on lighter skin, they may be fainter on darker skin. This means that Rocky Mountain spotted fever can be easily missed in people with dark skin. Southern tick-associated rash illness: With STARI, you get a rash just like Lyme disease: a red bull’s-eye with the bite in the center. Tularemia: There are different types of tularemia, but with the most common one, you get a painful open sore where the tick bit you. Ehrlichiosis: Children get the rash more often than adults. The rash can vary from small, flat, red, or purple spots to red areas of skin covered with small bumps.', 'How to Treat a Tick Bite If you find a tick still on your skin, follow these steps: Remove it. Don’t touch the tick with your bare hands. Gently pull it straight out with tweezers. Don’t twist or squeeze it. Make sure you’ve removed the whole tick. Save it in a sealed container. It helps to have a doctor look at or test your tick so you know if it was carrying diseases. Wash your hands and the site of the bite. Once the tick is gone, use soap and water to make sure you’ve cleaned off any of the tick’s saliva. It’s important to start treatment for diseases from ticks as soon as possible. If your tick bite is infected or you’ve gotten a disease from it, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics to help get rid of the infection or disease.', 'When Should I Call My Doctor? Call or see your doctor if you: Can’t get the tick totally out Get a rash (Even if the rash goes away, that doesn’t mean the disease is gone.) Have any flu -like symptoms, with or without a rash See red streaks, or yellow fluid oozing from the bite, meaning the bite is infected Some people have more serious reactions to the bite itself. Go to the emergency room if you have: Anaphylaxis . This is a life-threatening reaction that needs medical care right away. Tick paralysis . If you have this, you will be unable to move. Paralysis usually goes away within 24 hours of removing the tick. Call 911 or go to the emergency room if you have any of these symptoms: You can’t move your arms, legs, or part of your face. It’s hard to breathe . Your heart feels like it’s fluttering, skipping beats, or beating too hard or too fast. You have a severe headache. You feel weakness in your arms or legs.', 'How to Prevent Tick Bites You can lower your chance of tick bites by preparing yourself before you go outside and knowing what to look for once you’re back inside. Use these tick tips to protect yourself: Know where ticks lurk. You’re most likely to come into contact with ticks in long grassy, brush, or in wooded areas. You can even get them from brushing up against an animal that has one. Be on the lookout when you camp, garden, hunt, or spend time outdoors. Treat clothes with permethrin . Products with 0.5% permethrin help repel ticks. You put it on your clothes, shoes, and gear, not skin. Treat skin with insect repellents. If you know you’ll be in a tick-friendly area, use products with DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE), para-menthane-diol (PMD), or 2-undecanone on your skin to help make sure ticks and other bugs buzz off. Hike smart. When you’re outdoors, try to avoid places where you’ll rub against trees, plants, or grass. Walk in the center of trails. Do tick checks. Spend time looking for ticks on your body, pets, clothing, and gear after you come in from time outdoors. Use a mirror for hard-to-see areas of your body, and don’t forget to check your scalp. Wash off. Taking a shower within 2 hours of being outdoors can reduce your chance of getting a tick-borne disease. Running water and scrubbing with soap can help remove ticks from your body. Wash laundry on hot to rid your clothes of any hidden ticks.']"

40,Tietze Syndrome,"[""What Is Tietze Syndrome? Tietze syndrome is a rare musculoskeletal condition that causes inflammation. It can hurt a lot but is rarely serious. It happens when cartilage around the joints that connect your upper ribs to your breastbone (sternum) swells from some kind of irritation. Usually, the second or third ribs are most affected. Tietze syndrome was named after Alexander Tietze, a German surgeon\xa0who first wrote about it in 1921. Tietze syndrome is different from Tietz syndrome, a condition that causes hearing loss. Tietz syndrome is congenital, or present from birth, and is also rare. Tietze syndrome vs. costochondritis Tietze syndrome and another condition called costochondritis are very similar, but they aren't the same. Both affect your costochondral joint (where your ribs connect to your sternum). Two big differences are location and swelling. Costochondritis usually affects the lower ribs. It can cause pain throughout your chest, and the pain may start on the left side and spread out. Unlike Tietze syndrome, it doesn’t cause any visible tissue swelling. Tietze syndrome and costochondritis aren’t usually serious and are often managed the same way."", ""Is Tietze syndrome dangerous? Rarely. But you should still see your doctor about it.

Spots that don’t tan the way the rest of your skin does. Spots that show up more boldly when you do tan. Spots that may occur anywhere on your body but are most commonly seen on your neck, chest, back, and arms. Spots that are dry and scaly and may itch or hurt, although this is rare.', 'The spots may disappear during cool weather and worsen during warm and humid weather. Tinea versicolor on face Tinea versicolor can occasionally appear on your face. But if you have a rash on your face, it’s more likely to be a separate condition. For example, seborrheic dermatitis, commonly called dandruff, is a skin condition that causes scaly, itchy skin patches. It’s most often seen on the scalp, but it can also appear on other oily areas of the body, including the face, sides of the nose, eyelids, eyebrows, and skin under the beard or mustache. Unlike tinea versicolor, scaly dandruff patches are red and can flake off onto your hair or clothing. If you have brown or black skin, the rash may appear darker or lighter than your natural color. If your skin is lighter, the rash may be redder in color. Seborrheic dermatitis is sometimes called seborrheic eczema or seborrheic psoriasis.

It differs from tinea versicolor in its cause, symptom, and treatment. Vitiligo is an autoimmune condition in which the body's immune system attacks and destroys the cells responsible for producing the pigment melanin in the skin. It results in the loss of pigment, causing white, colorless patches on otherwise normally pigmented skin. The darker your skin, the more noticeable the white patches. Unlike tinea versicolor, vitiligo itself doesn't cause itching or discomfort. Vitiligo affects different areas of the body than tinea versicolor. The spots caused by vitiligo are smooth, while tinea versicolor may make your skin rough or scaly in some patches. Tinea versicolor vs pityriasis rosea Pityriasis rosea is a skin condition that can cause rashes, but it has different causes and characteristics than tinea versicolor. Pityriasis rosea typically starts with a single, larger round or oval patch of scaly skin\xa0on the face, back, chest, or abdomen surrounded by a raised border. If you have darker skin, the rash is purple or red-brown. On lighter skin, it’s pinker or salmon-colored. This rash is known as the “herald patch” or “mother patch.”"", ""The herald patch is sometimes followed by the development of smaller “daughter patches.” These appear as bumps or scaly patches on the same area of the body.

42,Baby Safety,"[""Your child's safety is your responsibility. The following tips should help you keep your baby out of harm's way from birth through their toddler years."", ""Baby Safety in the Car Always use a federally approved car safety seat when traveling in a motor vehicle. Carefully read safety seat instructions, as well as instructions in your car's owner's manual, to ensure that the seat has been properly installed. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends buying a new car seat unless you’re sure a used seat has never been in an accident. NEVER carry your infant in your lap while you ride in a car. For the first 2 years of a baby's life, car seats should face the rear of the vehicle. The safest location for the car seat is the middle of the back seat. NEVER put the baby in the front passenger seat of cars, especially those with airbags. If you have a truck with no back seat, you should disengage the airbag while the baby's seat is in the car. Check the height and weight limits on your child’s car seat from time to time to be sure they haven’t outgrown it. You’ll also need to adjust the position of the harness straps as your baby gets bigger. If you have questions about safety seats, call the Auto Safety Hotline at 888-327-4236 (888-DASH-2-DOT). Or visit an NHTSA car seat inspection station . Often, they're located at fire stations. A certified technician will show you how to properly install and use your car seat. To minimize the risk that a child will accidentally be left behind in a car or get trapped inside: Leave a purse, briefcase, shoe, or cell phone in the back seat. That way, you get in the habit of checking in the back seat before leaving the vehicle. Make an arrangement with your child’s day care to have them call you if the child doesn’t show up as expected. Always lock your car and car trunk, even if the car is parked in the driveway at home, and always keep keys out of the reach of little ones."", 'Preventing Baby Falls If you use an infant carrier, always place it on the floor, never on a counter or tabletop. Make sure the baby is always strapped in. Never leave your baby alone on a bed, couch, changing table, or infant seat from which they can fall or roll off. Even if looking away for a second, an accident can happen.', 'Baby Safety, Smoking and Fire Safety Do not smoke and do not allow smoking around your baby. Even smoking “outside” is harmful for the baby because clothing, hair and skin still carry smoke particles. Install a working smoke alarm on every level of your home. Change the batteries of your smoke detectors every 6 months. Have at least one fire extinguisher on every level of your home. If your home uses gas heat, install a carbon monoxide detector.', 'Preventing Baby Burns Do not hold hot liquids while holding your baby. To prevent burns, do not microwave your baby\'s bottle. Many microwaves heat unevenly, creating ""hot spots"" in your baby\'s formula that can burn your baby\'s mouth. Instead, warm the formula by running warm tap water over the bottle or submerging the bottle in a bowl of warm water. Shake the bottle well. Make sure you test the temperature on your hand or wrist before feeding it to your baby. Keep your hot water heater\'s thermostat at no higher than 120 degrees F. Consider installing anti-scald devices on faucets and shower heads.', ""Preventing Baby Accidents Keep sharp objects (knives, scissors, tools, razors) and other hazardous items (coins, glass objects, beads, pins, medications ) in a secure place out of your baby's reach. NEVER shake a baby or throw your baby in the air. This can cause brain damage or blindness. Do not leave your baby alone with a young sibling or a pet, even when your baby is sleeping. Never put your child in a walker. They send thousands of kids to the emergency room every year, mainly by causing falls down stairs. Make sure that your baby cannot pull lamps or other electrical objects on top of themselves. Use electrical tape to secure electrical cords along baseboards. Remove tablecloths that can be pulled from the table. Make sure all drawers have stops so that your baby or toddler can't pull the drawer out on top of themselves. Attach furniture to the wall so the pieces don’t fall over the child. Avoid electronics on top of higher dressers or tables that can fall on the child."", 'Baby Bathing Safety Always test the bath water to make sure it is not too hot before setting your baby in the water. Dipping your elbow in the water is a good way to test. Turn down your water heater to 120 F. Never leave your baby unattended in the bathtub or bath ring. It only takes a few seconds for a baby to drown. Store small appliances, such as hair dryers and radios, away from the water and bathing areas. Keep these appliances unplugged and out of reach when not in use.', ""Baby Toy Safety Inspect your child's toys often. Be sure that toys are unbreakable, do not come apart, do not have small parts that could be chewed or broken off, and are not sharp. The pieces/toys should be larger than your baby's mouth . Use toy chests without lids or with supports that hold a lid open in any position. Be cautious with balloons to prevent choking."", ""Baby Choking or Strangulation Prevention NEVER put strings or cords around your baby's neck (such as to hold a pacifier ) or near your baby's crib. Be cautious of strings or buttons on clothing; make sure they are not in danger of choking your baby. Secure cords on blinds and drapes out of reach to prevent accidental strangulation. Put away small objects -- even display items -- that can cause injury or choking if swallowed."", ""Baby Feeding Safety Never prop up your baby's bottle and leave your baby unattended; your baby could choke. Do not put your baby to bed with a bottle. Avoid giving your child raw carrots, unpeeled apples, nuts, hard candies, and other foods that present a choking hazard. In a highchair, always use restraining straps that run around your child's waist and between their legs to keep them from sliding out."", ""Baby Sleeping Safety All infants should be put down for sleep on their backs to reduce the risk for sudden infant death syndrome, also called SIDS. Give your baby a pacifier before they go to sleep . This reduces the chance of SIDS. Avoid soft bedding that might suffocate your baby, such as pillows, blankets, plush toys, and bumpers in the crib. Crib slats should be 2 3/8 inches apart or less so the baby’s head can't get trapped. Keep your baby's room at a moderate temperature and dress them in a way that they can't overheat. This also reduces the risk of SIDS. Share a bedroom with your newborn -- but not a bed.\xa0The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that parents sleep in the same room, preferably for at least the first six months. Avoid devices marketed to reduce the risk of SIDS, such as sleep positioners. Nursing your baby and making sure that your baby gets all of the recommended vaccines can help protect against SIDS. Don’t nurse in a chair or on a couch if you feel you might fall asleep. If your baby falls asleep in a car seat, swing or carrier, try to remove them and lay them on a flat surface. Try to have skin-to-skin contact with your baby."", 'Changing Table Safety Use a sturdy table. Always keep your hands and eyes on your baby while they are on the changing table. Keep supplies within easy reach.', 'Babies and Pets Keep food and water bowls in an area your baby can’t reach. Same with the litterbox. Supervise your child’s interactions with your pets and teach them to be gentle. Hitting or tail-pulling can lead to bites and scratches. Don’t let your animals lick your baby’s face or skin, especially if they have a cut or scrape. Wash your child’s hands after they play with the dog or cat. Keep the pet toys out of your baby’s mouth. Most doctors say pets shouldn’t sleep in your child’s bed.', ""Baby Crawling and Walking Safety When your baby becomes mobile, here are important tips to keep your baby safe around your home: Put electrical outlet covers on all outlets. Secure electrical cords to baseboards. Install safety gates securely in front of stairs and basement doors. Avoid gates with diamond-shaped slats, which provide footholds for climbing toddlers. Instead, use gates with straight, vertical slats, and a swinging door. Use doorknob covers to keep children away from rooms and other areas with hazards. Be careful, though, that these devices are easy for adults to use in case of emergency. Store cleaners and medications out of reach and in a locked cabinet, and always in their original containers. Never store toxic substances in bottles or jars that could be mistaken for food products. Install safety locks on cabinets. Turn pot and pan handles on the stove in and cook on the back burners whenever possible. Establish the area in front of the stove as off-limits while you are cooking. Keep the toilet lid down to prevent drowning and to keep the lid from slamming on your baby's head or hands. Consider installing toilet lid locks. Cushion hard edges and sharp corners of furniture. If possible, move sharp-edged pieces of furniture away from high traffic areas. Anchor down unsteady pieces of furniture, such as bookcases. Place furniture away from high windows so children won't climb onto windowsills. Screens aren't strong enough to keep children from falling through windows."", 'Outdoor Safety If there is a swimming pool in your backyard or your neighborhood, make sure it is surrounded by a fence and has a gate that latches or locks. Better yet, never leave your child unattended when outdoors. Cover areas under and around backyard play sets with shock-absorbing material, such as sand, rubber, or mulch, 9-12 inches deep. During hot summer days, check the temperature of slides and swings. They can become hot enough to cause burns to the skin . Always supervise children on playground equipment. Watch for hazards like stair rungs where they can get stuck, missing guardrails, protruding bolts, or dangling ropes or cords. Teach your child to stay away from stray dogs and wild animals like squirrels and raccoons when you go to the park, and make sure they don’t get hold of animal droppings, which can carry germs. Keep your child away from moving machinery, including lawnmowers and overhead garage doors. Also, keep kids away from driveways and streets. Keep your baby in the shade, if possible. Their skin is thinner and more sensitive. Cover them up with clothes and a hat, limit their time in the sun (especially between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., when the sun is strongest), don’t let them get overheated, and get them out of the sun right away if they show any signs of sunburn or dehydration , including fussiness, redness, and excessive crying. Don’t put bug spray on babies younger than 2 months. Keep them inside when bugs are biting at dawn and dusk. Cover their skin with long sleeves and pants, and cover strollers with mesh netting. Get rid of standing water in your yard where mosquitoes breed, like planters and bird baths. After 2 months bug repellent is OK, but keep it off your baby’s hands and away from their mouth and eyes.', 'Other Baby Safety Precautions Consider taking a certified CPR class if you are not already certified. You can find out about these classes from your local Red Cross or American Heart Association chapter. You may want to post a demonstration chart near your phone. Your baby\'s caregivers should be CPR-certified. Gather a list of emergency numbers and keep them by the phone. These numbers should include: your child\'s pediatrician, your health care provider, your family doctor, a 24-hour nurse-on-call number, the police department, the fire department, 911 reminder, and poison control. If a poison is swallowed, call the poison control center (throughout the USA, call 800-222-1222 -- American Association of Poison Control Centers.) Keep poisonous house plants out of reach. For information about which plants are poisonous, contact your local county extension office. Beware of any device that claims to help prevent SIDS. Home monitors, wedges and positioners remain unproven. Name a guardian for your child. In the unfortunate event that something happens to you or your spouse, it\'s a good idea to have a will that names a legal guardian and alternate guardian for your child. Without a will, the court may appoint a guardian you would not have chosen. Be sure to check with the individuals named in your will to make sure they are willing to serve as your child\'s guardian. In your will, you can also leave assets to your child in the form of a testamentary, or ""after death"" trust.']"
43,Broken Toe,"['What Is a Broken Toe? A broken toe is when you break a bone in one of your toes. Each of your toes has three bones, except for the big toe, which has two. A break can happen when you stub your toe really hard or drop something on it. A broken toe doesn’t usually need much medical care. In fact, it can be tough to tell whether you broke it or just hurt it badly, and the treatment’s often the same.', 'Broken Toe Signs and Symptoms When you break a toe, you’ll likely have: Pain and tenderness in your toe Pain when you walk or put weight on your foot Redness or bruising Stiffness Swelling', 'When to Call a Doctor If you think you broke your toe, it’s best to have your doctor look at it. Even though you can often treat it yourself, a broken toe can sometimes lead to more serious problems, like infection, arthritis , or long-term foot pain .', 'Call your doctor if you have one these more serious breaks, which do need treatment: Big toe injury Broken bone sticking out of your skin or causing an open wound (can lead to an infection in your bone) Toe is bent or crooked For a less serious break, even if you put it off at first, call your doctor if you have: An illness that impacts the nerves or blood flow in your feet, like diabetes Fever or chills Intense pain under your toenail (possibly a blood buildup under the nail) Numbness, tingling, or coldness in your toe Pain that gets worse or doesn’t get better with over-the-counter pain medicine Blue or gray skin on your toe Swelling, bruising, or redness that doesn’t improve after a few days', 'Broken Toe Diagnosis First, your doctor will ask you what happened and what symptoms you’re having. They’ll check for tenderness and broken skin around your toe. They’ll also test your nerves and blood flow. Then, if your doctor thinks it’s a break, you’ll likely get an X-ray.', 'Broken Toe Treatment Treatment depends on where and how bad the break is. In most cases, you’ll be sent home with directions for self-care. You may also get a prescription for pain medicine. It helps you heal if you can keep your toe from bending too much. Your doctor might suggest buddy taping. That’s where you tape your broken toe to the toe next to it. First, you first put cotton or gauze between your toes so the skin doesn’t rub and get raw. Then, you wrap them with medical tape. You doctor may also give you a stiff-bottomed shoe with a cloth top. This keeps your toe from bending too much and allows room for swelling. If you broke your toe all the way through and the bone moved, your doctor may need to set it back in place. First, you’ll get a shot to numb your toe. Then your doctor moves the bones back together with their hands. There’s no surgery involved. You may get a cast if the bone pieces don’t stay in place.', 'If you have a wound, you may also get antibiotics and a tetanus shot . If you have blood trapped under your toenail, your doctor will try to drain it but may have to remove the nail completely. For very serious breaks, you may need surgery to put in pins or screws that hold the bones in place.', 'Broken Toe Home Remedies For the first few days or weeks after you break your toe, you can: Keep your foot raised while sitting or lying down (above your heart is best) to keep the swelling and pain down. Put ice on your toe for 20 minutes every hour while you’re awake. That’s for the first 24 hours. After that, you can ice it two to three times a day. Don’t put ice right on your skin. Wrap it in a towel instead. Rest. Ease up on activity that causes pain. Take pain medicine with ibuprofen , acetaminophen , or naproxen , if you need it. Wear shoes with stiff soles.', 'Broken Toe Recovery Most of the time, your toe will heal in about 4-6 weeks. But it could take as long as 8 weeks for more serious breaks. You’ll need to hold off on sports and other physical activities until your doctor gives you the green light. If you start those too soon, you might re-injure your toe. As you heal, it’s also best to avoid high heels or any shoes that squeeze your toes. When you can wear shoes and walk without pain, you can ease back into your normal activities. You can expect some stiffness or soreness when you first get going again, but that will fade as you get back to normal.']"
44,Potty Training,"[""What Is Potty Training? When you have a baby , you're knee-deep in diapers. They're tucked into your bag. Stacked near the crib. Stored in boxes under beds. You might even have a few stashed in the glove compartment of your car, just in case. Diapers are part of your life, day in, day out, for so long that it's hard to imagine not needing them anymore. It seems like the day when your child will walk into the bathroom, pee or poop , wipe, wash hands, and walk back out without you even knowing it is a long way off. And yet, that day is coming. And it’ll be as glorious as it has been in your dreams. Between now and then, there's a big project: potty training , or to use the grown-up term, toilet training. You may be ready to make the transition, but is your little one?"", ""When to Start Potty Training With potty training, just like talking, walking, and sleeping through the night, every child's timing is different. There’s no perfect age to start potty training. How will you know if your child is ready? They’ll show interest in various ways, including asking questions about the toilet, potty seats, and underwear."", ""Whether or not your child is ready depends on where they are physically and emotionally. Many kids show interest around 2, while others couldn't care less until they're 2 1/2 or 3. But there are always exceptions. Girls usually show interest earlier than boys and are quicker to get the hang of it. There's no need to whip out a potty seat the second your child's questions start. Ask yourself a few questions first: Can my child sit on a potty seat and get back up without my help? Can they follow basic instructions? Do they tell me when it's time to go? Can my child pull down diapers, training pants, or underwear without my help? Can they control bladder and bowel muscles and keep a diaper dry for at least 2 hours? Does it bother them to have a dirty diaper?"", ""If you've answered yes to those questions, your child is ready. But are you? Though having a potty-trained child is easier in the long run, it takes time, focus, and plenty of patience. It may be best to wait if: You’re about to have another child You’re traveling You’re about to move Your child is switching from a crib to a bed Your child is sick, especially if diarrhea is involved Your family is going through turmoil, like serious illness or death Holding off until you’re resettled into a routine will help set you both up for success. If you start potty training before your child is ready, the process may take longer than needed. And no doubt, you’ve already noticed how stubborn toddlers can be."", 'Potty Training Tips Be a positive potty model. When you go to the bathroom, use it as a chance to talk your child through the process. Use words your child can say, like pee, poop, and potty. If you plan to start your child on a potty seat, put it in the bathroom so they get used to it. Make it a fun place your child wants to sit, with or without the diaper on. Let them sit on the potty seat while you read or offer a toy. Tune in to cues. Be aware of how your child behaves when they have to pee or poop. Look for a red face and listen for grunting sounds. Then get them to the potty quick! Take notice of the time when they pee and poop during the day. Then establish a routine in which your child sits on the potty during those times, especially after meals or after drinking a lot of fluid. Dress them in clothing they can easily manage by themselves. Teach them to wipe correctly, from front to back, and to wash their hands when they’re finished. Boys have an easier time learning to pee sitting down first. Use plenty of praise, praise, and more praise. Do words motivate your child? Stickers on a chart? Small toys or extra bedtime stories? Check in with what feels right for you and use it to reward positive potty choices. Your good attitude will come in handy, especially when “accidents” happen.', ""Having Patience When Potty Training Sitting on the potty should be a want-to, not a have-to. If your child isn't into it, don't force it. Just when you think your child has nailed it, accidents happen. It's OK to be frustrated, but don’t punish or shame your child. It won't get you closer to your goal. Take a deep breath and focus on what you and your child can do better next time. Don’t turn potty training into a power struggle. The more you push, the more they may resist. If your child feels stressed and anxious, they may have setbacks. Don’t compare your child with other children. Some parents like to brag about how easy potty training went in their family. So if your neighbor says their kids potty trained themselves, smile and remember that the only right way is the one that works for you."", 'Nighttime and Naptime Potty Training When your child is finally able to use the toilet on their own, it’s a milestone to celebrate. But staying dry when they sleep is a whole different ball game. It may take months or years for their bodies to mature to the point that they always wake up when they need to go. So don’t sweat it. Put a protective cover on their mattress and keep using diapers or training pants at naptime and overnight while your child grows. But talk to your doctor if they’re ready to start school and are still wetting at night.']"
45,Tongue Cancer: Facts That You Need to Know,"[""What Is Tongue Cancer? This is one of the several kinds of oral ( mouth ) cancers. Like other cancers, it happens when cells divide out of control and form a growth or tumor. There are two types. One is called oral tongue cancer because it affects the part you can stick out. The other happens at the base of your tongue , where it connects to your throat. This type, called oropharyngeal cancer,\xa0is often diagnosed after it has spread to the lymph nodes in your neck. Tongue cancer is less common than many other types. Most people who get it are older adults. It's rare in children."", ""Tongue Cancer Symptoms One of the first signs of tongue cancer is a white or red patch, lump, or sore on the side of your tongue that doesn't go away. You may also have: Pain in or near your tongue Changes in your voice, like sounding hoarse Trouble swallowing or chewing or with moving your jaw or tongue Numbness of the tongue or mouth Jaw swelling Constant sore throat A feeling like something is caught in your throat Swollen lymph nodes in your neck Coughing up blood Weight loss Ear pain Bleeding in your mouth A lump in the back of your mouth, throat, or neck"", ""If you have a sore on your tongue or in your mouth that doesn't get better in a couple of weeks, see your doctor. If the problem is at the base of your tongue, you may not notice any symptoms. Your dentist may find signs of tongue cancer during a checkup, or your doctor might notice something during a regular exam."", 'Causes of Tongue Cancer The human papillomavirus ( HPV ) can\xa0cause\xa0cancers on the base of the tongue. HPV also can infect your genital area and cause cervical cancer , penile cancer, and anal cancer. HPV infection is the most common sexually transmitted infection. There are many types of HPV . The ones that raise your odds of getting cancer are called high-risk HPVs. Other things that may raise your chances of getting tongue cancer include: Tobacco use Alcohol use Jagged teeth Not taking care of your teeth and gums Chewing betel, common in South and Southeast Asia A personal history of certain cancers A poor diet', ""Your genes also may play a role in whether you're likely to get tongue cancer . Tongue cancer is more common in men and people assigned male at birth than in women and people assigned female at birth. You're also more likely to get the illness if you're 45 or older and have a weakened immune system."", ""Diagnosis of Tongue Cancer Your doctor will examine your mouth and ask questions about your symptoms. Then, they may suggest testing to diagnose tongue cancer, including: Imaging tests. These tests, such as X-rays, CT , MRI, and PET scans, capture detailed pictures of your mouth, including where the cancer is located and its size. You could also need a barium swallow, a type of X-ray where you drink a liquid called barium. It makes the signs of cancer more visible on X-rays. Biopsy. Your doctor may also take a sample of tissue from your mouth to test (a biopsy ). They could use different techniques to get the sample, including: Brush biopsy. In this method, doctors use a stiff brush to gather cells from your tongue, moving the brush in a circular motion. Incisional biopsy. This is where a doctor makes a small elliptical-shaped cut on your tongue to remove tissue samples. Endoscopy. During this test, your doctor will insert a thin tube fitted with a light and camera into your nose and down your throat, where they'll look for signs of cancer. An endoscopy can also show if cancer has spread to other areas of your throat."", 'Tongue cancer staging Diagnosis also helps your doctor figure out the stage of your tongue cancer, meaning how large the tumor is and whether it has spread.

In this system: ""T"" describes the size and scope of the main tumor called the primary tumor ""N"" describes how many of your lymph nodes have cancer ""M"" describes whether your cancer has spread to other parts of your body (metastasized) The TNM system also uses a series of numbers after each letter to provide even more information about the cancer, like the size of the main tumor.', ""Treatment of Tongue Cancer Your treatment will depend on where your tumor is and how big it is. Surgery. During this operation, called a glossectomy, a surgeon takes out all or a portion of your tongue, depending on how large the cancer is. They'll also remove some healthy cells surrounding your tongue. If it looks like the cancer has spread to your lymph nodes, the surgeon could take out some of this tissue (called a neck dissection). After surgery, you may need physical therapy and rehab for speaking and swallowing problems. Reconstructive surgery. Doctors use this type of surgery to restore parts of your face or mouth that need to be removed during a cancer operation. They'll take healthy bone or tissue from other parts of your body and use it to replace parts of the tongue, lip, face, and other areas. Radiation therapy. This treatment directs strong energy beams from X-rays, protons, or other means at specific places on your body to kill cancer cells. Chemotherapy. With this treatment, you'll take medicine before or after cancer surgery to control cancer cell growth or kill lingering cells. Targeted therapy. Targeted therapy kills cancer cells by attacking specific chemicals within them. Doctors may use it to treat tongue cancer that has returned or spread beyond the tumor. Immunotherapy. If you have advanced tongue cancer and other treatments aren't working, your doctor could suggest immunotherapy. It works by helping your immune system to locate and kill cancer cells."", ""You may also want to consider a clinical trial for tongue cancer, where you'll have the chance to try a new treatment.

Grooves may connect with other grooves, separating the tongue into small lobes or sections. Unless debris builds up in these fissures, you are unlikely to have any symptoms. Fissures may first appear during childhood. However, fissures are more common in adults. And, just as wrinkles can deepen with age, fissures can also become more pronounced as you get older. If you have regular dental exams, your dentist has no doubt spotted the fissures on your tongue. This is how most fissures are found.', ""Conditions Associated With Fissured Tongue About 2% to 5% of the U.S. population has a fissured tongue. A fissured tongue may affect men slightly more often than women. Because a fissured tongue can cluster in families, it may be genetically inherited. Although other causes of fissured tongue are unknown, it may appear along with other conditions such as these: Geographic tongue, also known as benign migratory glossitis (BMG). This benign condition often shows up along with fissured tongue. It may cause no symptoms other than sensitivity to hot and spicy foods. Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome. This is a rare condition. It not only causes a fissured tongue, but also lip or facial swelling and paralysis in the face ( Bell's palsy ) that may come and go. Down syndrome . Fissured tongue occurs in as many as 80% of children with the chromosomal disorder Down syndrome. It is not common to need a biopsy of a fissured tongue. If a fissured tongue causes any symptoms, your dentist may encourage you to brush your tongue. This may help remove debris that has built up in deep fissures, causing irritation. In almost all cases, though, no treatment is needed.

The bacteria build up on tiny rounded projections called papillae. These lie along the surface of the tongue. Instead of shedding as they normally do, the papillae start to grow and lengthen, creating hair -like projections. They can grow to 15 times their normal length. Normally, the papillae are pinkish-white. But as they grow, pigments from food, drinks, and possibly the bacteria or yeast themselves get caught in the papillae, dyeing the tongue a color. Most often that color is black, hence the name. But the tongue can also turn brown, yellow, green, or a variety of other colors. Certain lifestyle habits and conditions can make people more likely to develop black hairy tongue. They include: poor oral hygiene smoking tobacco drinking a lot of coffee or tea using antibiotics (which may disrupt the normal balance of bacteria in the mouth ) being dehydrated taking medications that contain the chemical bismuth (such as Pepto-Bismol for upset stomach ) not producing enough saliva regularly using mouthwash that contains peroxide, witch hazel, or menthol getting radiation therapy to the head and neck Black hairy tongue is more common in men, people who use intravenous drugs, and those who are HIV-positive.', ""What Are the Symptoms of Black Hairy Tongue? Other than the appearance of the tongue, most people with black hairy tongue don't have any symptoms or feel any discomfort. The exception is when there is too much growth of the yeast Candida albicans , which can cause a burning sensation on the tongue. This burning sensation is called glossopyrosis. Some people complain of a tickling feeling in the back of the roof of the mouth, a metallic taste in their mouth, or nausea . In more severe cases, the condition may lead to a gagging feeling. Sometimes, food getting caught inside the extra-long papillae can cause bad breath ."", ""How Is Black Hairy Tongue Treated? Practicing good oral hygiene is the best way to treat black hairy tongue. Gently brush your teeth twice a day with a soft toothbrush . Also, brush your tongue. You can use a tongue scraper to make sure you're thoroughly cleaning the area. Drink plenty of water throughout the day to help keep your mouth clean."", ""Other tips include: If you smoke, quit. Add more roughage to your diet. Soft foods won't clean off the tongue effectively. Call your doctor or dentist if the problem doesn't get better on its own. Your doctor may prescribe antibiotics or an antifungal drug to get rid of the bacteria or yeast. Topical medications, such as tretinoin (Retin-A), are also sometimes prescribed. As a last resort, if the problem doesn't improve, the papillae can be surgically clipped off with a laser or electrosurgery.""]"
49,Tongue-Tie in Babies,"['What Is Tongue-Tie? Tongue-tie, also known as ankyloglossia , is a condition some babies are born with that limits their tongue movements. To do its job well, your tongue needs to be able to reach almost every part of your mouth. That full range of motion lets you make different sounds when you speak. It also helps you swallow and sweep away bits of food to keep your mouth clean. With tongue-tie, an unusually short, thick, or tight band of tissue (lingual frenulum) tethers the tip of the tongue to the floor of the mouth. (Photo credit: Maryna Vladymyrska/Dreamstime) Tongue-tie means there’s a problem with the lingual frenulum. That’s the small stretch of tissue that connects the underside of your tongue to the bottom of your mouth . It might be too short and tight, or attached way up near the tip of the tongue. In mild cases, there might be only a tiny fold of tissue holding the tip of the tongue in place. In more extreme cases, the entire bottom of the tongue is attached to the floor of the mouth. About 10% of newborns have ankyloglossia . What does tongue-tie look like?', ""If you want to know if your baby's tongue is tied, look at the shape of their tongue when they're crying or lifting their tongue. The tip might look like a little heart. You might also notice that your baby ’s tongue: Can’t move far from side to side Can’t reach the upper gums or roof of the mouth Can’t stick out past the gums Can't curl toward their nose or lick their lips You could also look for the frenulum. When your baby cries or yawns, their tongue will draw back and you can see whether the frenulum (the thin stretch of tissue) is tight and short. Normal tongue vs. tongue-tie Normally, the lingual frenulum is attached to the bottom of your tongue, but you're able to move your tongue freely. In the case of tongue-tie, the frenulum is shortened or thickened, making free movement of the tongue difficult. Adult tongue-tie Adults can have tongue-tie if they never got treated for it as children. For some adults, tongue-tie doesn't affect their daily lives much. But others can have problems such as: Poor oral hygiene . Your tongue has limited mobility, so it can't remove food from between your teeth. Speech issues . You could have problems pronouncing words with letters such as “t,” “th,” “d”, “r,” “l” and “s.” Reduced quality of life . You could have trouble eating certain foods, kissing, licking your lips, or playing a wind instrument."", ""Tongue-tie in babies For some babies, tongue-tie isn't much of an issue. For others, it can lead to problems during breastfeeding . If the baby can't move their tongue properly, they may chew on the nipple instead of sucking. Not only does this cause pain to the parent feeding them but also keeps the baby from getting enough milk. A tongue-tie baby seems able to bottle-feed successfully, though. Doctors don’t always check for tongue-tie, and it’s not always easy to notice. But even if your child’s pediatrician doesn’t find it until later, it can be treated. Anterior tongue-tie This is when the entire bottom of the tongue is attached to the floor of the mouth. You can usually see this in the front of the mouth just behind the lower teeth and gums. It may look like a thin web or membrane. Most babies with tongue-tie have anterior tongue-tie. Posterior tongue-tie In this case, there's a short, tight frenulum near the base of the tongue, restricting its motion. It's often hard to see and is usually detected by feel. The term itself is controversial. The American Academy of Otolaryngology says that many ear, nose, and throat doctors (ENTs) believe that posterior tongue-tie “does not exist as an anatomic entity.” Britain's National Health Service doesn't treat it as it believes there's no evidence that posterior tongue-tie causes problems with breastfeeding."", ""Tongue-Tie Causes and Risk Factors During a fetus' development in the womb, the lingual frenulum is stuck to the tongue. But at some point before your baby is born, the membrane usually thins and separates from the tongue, so there's free range of motion. Sometimes, the separation doesn’t happen. Doctors aren’t sure why. It may run in families. Studies show that male infants are about twice as likely to be tongue-tied as female ones, and it's more common in first-born babies. The baby's race or ethnicity doesn't seem to make any difference."", 'Tongue-Tie Symptoms The condition is often found because of problems breastfeeding . You may notice that your tongue-tie newborn: Can’t latch well Tends to chew more than suck Doesn’t gain weight the way you’d expect Feeds for a long time, takes a short break, and then feeds for another long stretch Is fussy when trying to feed Makes a clicking sound while feeding Seems hungry all the time', 'Along with your baby ’s symptoms, you may have: Pain during and after breastfeeding Sore or cracked nipples Mastitis , or inflammation or infection of the breast Low milk supply But tongue-tie isn’t the only reason behind breastfeeding problems. So if you’re having them, talk to your doctor. In children, you should look for signs such as: Not pronouncing certain sounds like “t,” “th,” “d,” “r,” ""l,” and “s"" Trouble swallowing or moving their tongue from side to side Trouble licking an ice cream cone Trouble playing a wind instrument Does tongue-tie affect speech? Tongue-tie doesn\'t delay your child\'s progress in learning to speak but may result in difficulties pronouncing certain letters. But tongue-tie may not be the reason for your child\'s speech problem. At least one study found “no difference” in speech for young children who\'d been treated for tongue-tie vs. those who had not.', 'Tongue-Tie Diagnosis A physical exam is all it takes to see what’s going on. The doctor will: Ask how feeding is going Check your child’s tongue, mouth, and teeth Use a wooden stick called a tongue depressor to look under your child’s tongue and check the range of motion The doctor may ask an older kid to move their tongue around and make certain sounds.', ""Tongue-Tie Treatment Some doctors will want to treat tongue-tie right away. Others prefer a wait-and-see approach. The frenulum might loosen on its own, or it may not cause any long-term issues. A doctor may also suggest trying a speech therapist or a lactation consultant to help with speech or breastfeeding issues before moving on to surgery. Tongue-tie surgery There are three ways to take care of tongue-tie surgically: Frenotomy. This basic procedure happens in a doctor’s office. Sometimes, you don't even need numbing drugs . The doctor takes a pair of specially cleaned scissors and clips the frenulum, which doesn’t have many nerves or blood vessels. That means there’s not much pain. And if there’s any blood , it’s a drop or two at most. Your baby can breastfeed right away, which can be soothing and healing."", 'Frenectomy. This is similar to a frenotomy except instead of clipping the frenulum, the doctor completely removes it. Frenuloplasty. When the frenulum is too thick for a quick snip or if other repair is needed, your pediatrician will choose this option.', ""Your doctor will: Give your child drugs so they sleep through the whole thing Use special tools to cut the frenulum Put in a few stitches that dissolve on their own as the wound heals Some hospitals may use a laser instead. In that case, your child won’t need stitches. Your doctor might also recommend tongue exercises for your baby to prevent the frenulum from reattaching and to enhance tongue movement. With older children, this is not usually needed. Surgery for tongue-tie has exploded in the last 20 years, driven mainly by parental awareness and demand. Many doctors feel that the surgery is often not needed. On the other hand, a review of five clinical trials found that f renotomy was associated with breastfeeding improvements. More research needs to be done on this topic. What happens if your child's tongue-tie is left untreated? It depends on the child. In some cases, there are no problems if tongue-tie is untreated. In other cases, it may cause problems with breastfeeding, and later on, with speech, eating certain foods, and dental hygiene."", ""Tongue-Tie Treatment Risks Surgical treatments are usually very successful. It’s rare for them to cause issues. There are disadvantages to clipping a tongue, as with any medical procedure. These risks include: Bleeding Damage to the tongue or the glands that make saliva Infection A frenuloplasty can also lead to scarring that affects the tongue's movement. And your child could have a reaction to the drugs used to help them sleep. There is also the risk that the surgery doesn't fix the problem."", ""Tongue-Tie Complications There’s no way to know whether or not treating a baby's tongue-tie will lead to complications. But in some cases, untreated tongue-tie can lead to these complications as they get older: Dental problems such as tooth decay , swollen and irritated gums, and a gap between the lower two front teeth, due to limited tongue movement to remove food debris Excessive dribbling and mouth soreness Gagging or choking on foods as your child starts to eat solids A hard time with basic things, such as licking an ice cream cone and kissing Trouble with certain sounds when speaking (rolling an “r” can be especially hard) Talk it through with your doctor to learn what’s best for you and your baby."", 'Takeaways A simple surgical procedure can treat tongue-tie in babies. But it may not always solve problems with breastfeeding or speech. Talk to your doctor to see whether surgery is necessary.', ""Tongue-tie FAQs Does tongue-tie need to be corrected? Not always. Sometimes it doesn't impact a baby or child's life. Each case is different. At what age should a tongue-tie be cut? Usually, the procedure is done between the ages of 6 months and 6 years. Some doctors and dentists believe in doing it as early as possible, even at 2-6 weeks. But adults can also have a frenectomy. Speak with your doctor to see whether your child should have the procedure or if you should wait and see what happens.""]"
50,Eye Pupils,"['What Are Pupils? Pupils are the dark-colored openings at the center of your eyes that let light in. Doctors can look at your pupils for clues about your health. The size of your pupils and how they react to light can help diagnose certain health problems. For instance, if you’ve had a blow to the head and one or both of your pupils are dilated -- larger than normal -- that can be a sign of a serious brain injury. Your doctor also can use what’s called a “swinging light test” to find out if your pupils react to light the same way. Sometimes they’ll put medicated eye drops into your eyes to dilate them and make it easier to see into your eyeball. If you notice any sudden change in the size of your pupils and there’s no known reason, see your doctor right away.', 'Conditions That Affect the Pupils Some conditions that can affect your pupils include: Anisocoria : This is when one pupil is larger than the other . About 1 in 5 people may have this. Perhaps the best-known person with this condition was the singer David Bowie, whose left eye was permanently dilated after an injury. If you don’t have other symptoms, you might compare the size of your pupils with older photos of yourself to try to figure out when it happened.', 'Though it is rarely the case, it can be a sign of a bigger problem if anisocoria just shows up or the size of your two pupils is suddenly different for no apparent reason. Coloboma: This happens when part of your eye doesn’t form the right way before you’re born. A coloboma in the iris usually leads to the pupil being longer than it should be, sometimes giving it a keyhole-like shape. Third cranial nerve palsy: This dangerous condition that can make one pupil dilate. It’s often caused by pressure on one of the nerves that control eye movements. If you also have a headache and double vision , it can be a sign of an aneurysm -- a weak area in the wall of a blood vessel. If the aneurysm is small, you might not even know it’s there, but it can be dangerous if it grows, ruptures, and leaks blood into the space around your brain .', ""Pituitary gland tumor: This gland controls several other glands that make hormones. A tumor in this gland can make your pupil bigger. Horner’s syndrome : This condition makes a pupil shrink. You may have been born with it, but it’s usually caused by something that affects the nerves around your eyes. Adie syndrome : Sometimes called Holmes-Adie syndrome, it makes one pupil larger than normal and slow to react to light. The cause is often unknown, but it sometimes happens after an injury or lack of blood flow. Brain injury: A head injury can sometimes cause your pupils to become bigger than normal or two different sizes. If you have a head injury and your pupils change size, you should go to an emergency room. Cluster headache: These headaches cause pain on one side of your head. Your pupil on the side of the headache may get smaller when you have this kind of headache. Iritis: This condition causes irritation and swelling around your pupil. If you don't get it treated it can leave you with scar tissue that can make your pupil’s shape irregular."", 'Medications That Affect the Pupils Some medications and illegal drugs can cause your pupils to change size in one or both eyes. Medications that can affect the way your pupils look include: Amphetamines Anticholinergics Antihistamines Antipsychotics Botulinum toxin (Botox) Decongestants Medications for Parkinson’s disease Medications to prevent seizures Muscle relaxants Tricyclic antidepressants Illegal drugs including “bath salts,” cocaine, and LSD can also affect your pupil size.', 'How Your Emotions Can Affect Your Pupils Some emotional responses can cause your pupils to get larger. Studies have found that when people hear someone laugh or cry, for example, their pupils get larger. Your pupils may also get bigger if you see something that causes an emotional reaction.']"
51,Tonsillitis,"['What Is Tonsillitis? Tonsillitis is an infection of your tonsils, which are two masses of tissue at the back of your throat. Your tonsils act as filters, trapping germs that could otherwise enter your airways and cause infection. They also make antibodies to fight infection. But sometimes, they get overwhelmed by bacteria or viruses. This can make them swollen and inflamed. Tonsillitis is common, especially in children. It can happen once in a while or come back again and again in a short period. There are three types: Acute tonsillitis. These symptoms usually last 3-4 days but can persist for up to 2 weeks. Recurrent tonsillitis. This is when you get tonsillitis several times a year. Chronic tonsillitis. This is when you have a long-term tonsil infection. Your tonsils act as filters, trapping germs that could otherwise enter your airways and cause infection. They also make antibodies to fight infection. (Photo credit: WebMD)', 'Tonsillitis Symptoms The main symptoms of tonsillitis are inflamed and swollen tonsils, sometimes severe enough to make it hard to breathe through your mouth. Other symptoms include: Throat pain or tenderness Fever Red tonsils A white or yellow coating on your tonsils Painful blisters or ulcers on your throat Headache Loss of appetite Ear pain Trouble swallowing Swollen glands in your neck or jaw Fever and chills Bad breath A scratchy or muffled voice Stiff neck', 'Tonsillitis Symptoms in Children In children, tonsillitis symptoms may also include: Upset stomach Vomiting Stomach pain Drooling Not wanting to eat or swallow', ""Tonsillitis Causes Both bacterial and viral infections cause tonsillitis.\xa0If you have tonsillitis, it's important for your doctor to determine the correct cause in order to find the right treatment. Viral tonsillitis Several different viruses may make your tonsils inflamed, leading to tonsillitis. Some include: Adenoviruses Influenza virus Epstein-Barr virus Parainfluenza viruses Enteroviruses Herpes simplex virus HIV Generally, viral tonsillitis is less severe and more common than bacterial tonsillitis, making up about 70% of cases. This form of the condition should not be treated with antibiotics. Sometimes, viral tonsillitis caused by Epstein-Barr virus can occur with\xa0mononucleosis (or mono). If you develop mono, you may also have fatigue, fever, muscle aches, and loss of appetite. In rare cases, you might develop hives, a racing pulse, and nosebleeds as well. If you think you might have mono, ask your doctor to perform a test to confirm. Mono is rarely life-threatening, but if you are diagnosed with the condition, you should avoid certain contact sports until the infection is cleared to prevent rupturing your spleen."", 'Bacterial tonsillitis Another common cause of tonsillitis is\xa0Streptococcus (strep) bacteria, which can also lead to strep throat. Occasionally other bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus , can inflame your tonsils as well. These infections are usually treatable with antibiotics. Bacterial tonsillitis sometimes leads to a condition called quinsy. This occurs when an abscess (or a buildup of pus) develops next to your tonsil, pushing it toward the center of your throat. Quinsy can be quite painful, and can even make it difficult to open your mouth. If this occurs, your doctor may need to perform a minor procedure to remove the abscess. Tonsillitis vs. strep throat Strep throat and tonsillitis often go hand-in-hand. If you have strep throat, there is a good chance that you will develop tonsillitis as well. But getting tonsillitis does not always mean that you have strep throat. Your doctor will need to swab the back of your throat and perform a culture to determine whether strep bacteria are present.', ""In addition to swollen tonsils and soreness, the symptoms of strep throat typically include fever, swollen lymph nodes, red spots on the roof of your mouth, and white streaks on the back of your throat. You may also experience nausea, headaches, stomach pain, or a rash. If you have a runny nose or cough in addition to tonsillitis, you probably don't have strep. Repeated strep throat infections might indicate that you need to have your tonsils removed. Is tonsillitis contagious? Tonsillitis itself isn't contagious, but the infections that cause it can be. You can catch bacterial tonsillitis through contact with an infected person's saliva, including respiratory droplets. Viruses that cause tonsillitis are spread in a number of ways. You can pick them up from surfaces such as doorknobs and phone screens. Some, such as influenza viruses, are airborne, while others, such as Epstein-Barr virus, are passed along via contact with saliva—or, in the case of HIV, sexually transmitted."", ""Tonsillitis Risk Factors Some things may increase your risk of getting tonsillitis: Age. Children tend to get tonsillitis more than adults. When you are very young, your tonsils play an important role in your body's immune function. But as you age, they become less important. Experts believe this could explain why adults are so much less susceptible to tonsillitis than children. Kids in the age group of 5-15 years are more likely to get tonsillitis caused by bacterial infections. Tonsillitis caused by viral infections is more common in very young children. Elderly adults are at a higher risk for tonsillitis too. Germ exposure. Children also spend more time with other kids their age in school or camp, so they can easily spread infections that lead to tonsillitis. Adults who spend a lot of time around young children, such as teachers, may also be more likely to pick up infections and get tonsillitis. The weather. Some research suggests that atmospheric conditions can\xa0influence your risk of getting tonsillitis. Hotter weather and higher levels of smog are associated with an increased chance of tonsillitis. But humidity does not seem to impact your odds of developing the condition. Immune cells. Certain people are predisposed to recurring bacterial tonsillitis infections. Research suggests that the balance of immune cells your body produces might determine whether you are more likely to have recurring episodes of tonsillitis."", 'Tonsillitis Diagnosis Your doctor will do a physical exam. They’ll look at your tonsils to see if they’re red or swollen or have pus in them. They’ll also check for a fever. They may look in your ears and nose for signs of infection and feel the sides of your neck for swelling and pain. You might need tests to find the cause of your tonsillitis. They include: A throat swab. Your doctor will test saliva and cells from your throat for strep bacteria. They’ll run a cotton swab along the back of your throat. This might be uncomfortable but won’t hurt. Results are usually ready in 10-15 minutes. Sometimes, your doctor will also want a lab test that takes a couple of days. If these tests are negative, a virus is what caused your tonsillitis. A blood test. Your doctor may call this a complete blood cell count (CBC). It looks for high and low numbers of blood cells to show whether a virus or bacteria caused your tonsillitis. Rash. Your doctor will check for scarlatina, a rash linked to strep throat infections.', 'Tonsillitis Complications Complications usually happen only in the case of bacterial infections. They include: A collection of pus around your tonsil ( peritonsillar abscess ) Middle ear infection Tonsil stones, or small lumps that form on your tonsils, which can cause bad breath Breathing problems or breathing that stops and starts while you sleep ( obstructive sleep apnea ) Tonsillar cellulitis, or infection that spreads and deeply penetrates nearby tissues', 'Tonsillitis and Strep Infection If you have strep bacteria and don’t get treatment, your illness could lead to a more serious problem, including: Rheumatic fever Scarlet fever Sinusitis A kidney infection called glomerulonephritis', 'Tonsillitis Treatment Your treatment will depend in part on what caused your illness. Tonsillitis medication If your tests point to bacterial tonsillitis, you’ll get antibiotics . Your doctor might give you these drugs via a one-time injection or in pills that you’ll swallow for several days. You’ll start to feel better within 2 or 3 days, but it’s important to take all of your antibiotics for tonsillitis.', ""Tonsillitis home remedies If you have viral tonsillitis, antibiotics won't help, and your body will fight the infection on its own. In the meantime, you can try some home remedies for tonsillitis self-care: Get lots of rest. Drink warm or very cold fluids to help with throat pain . Eat smooth foods, such as flavored gelatins, ice cream, and applesauce. Use a cool-mist vaporizer or humidifier in your room. Gargle with warm salt water. Suck on lozenges with benzocaine or other medications to numb your throat. Take over-the-counter pain relievers such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Tonsillectomy Tonsils are an important part of your immune system, so your doctor will try to help you keep them. But if your tonsillitis keeps coming back or won’t go away, or if swollen tonsils make it hard for you to breathe or eat, you might need to have your tonsils taken out. This surgery is called tonsillectomy. Tonsillectomy used to be a very common treatment. But now, doctors recommend this surgery only if your tonsillitis keeps coming back. That means you or your child has had tonsillitis more than seven times in one year, more than four or five times a year for the past 2 years, or more than three times a year for the past 3 years."", 'Usually, your doctor uses a sharp tool called a scalpel to take out your tonsils.

52,Preventing Tooth Decay,"['Tooth decay is the destruction of tooth structure and can affect both the enamel (the outer coating of the tooth ) and the dentin layer of the tooth. Tooth decay occurs when foods containing carbohydrates (sugars and starches), such as breads, cereals, milk, soda, fruits, cakes, or candy are left on the teeth. Bacteria that live in the mouth digest these foods, turning them into acids. The bacteria, acid, food debris, and saliva combine to form plaque, which clings to the teeth. The acids in plaque dissolve the enamel surface of the teeth, creating holes in the teeth called cavities. To prevent tooth decay: Brush your teeth at least twice a day with a fluoride-containing toothpaste. Preferably, brush after each meal and especially before going to bed. Clean between your teeth daily with dental floss or interdental cleaners, such as the Oral-B Interdental Brush, Reach Stim-U-Dent, or Sulcabrush. Rinse daily with a fluoride-containing mouthwash . Some rinses also have antiseptic ingredients to help kill bacteria that cause plaque. Eat nutritious and balanced meals and limit snacks. Avoid carbohydrates such as candy, pretzels and chips, which can remain on the tooth surface. If sticky foods are eaten, brush your teeth soon afterwards. Check with your dentist about using supplemental fluoride, which strengthens your teeth. Ask your dentist about dental sealants (a plastic protective coating) applied to the chewing surfaces of your back teeth (molars) to protect them from decay. Drink fluoridated water. At least a pint of fluoridated water each day is needed to protect children from tooth decay. Visit your dentist regularly for professional cleanings and oral exams.', 'Researchers are developing new means to prevent tooth decay. One study found that a chewing gum that contains the sweetener xylitol temporarily retarded the growth of bacteria that cause tooth decay. In addition, several materials that slowly release fluoride over time, which will help prevent further decay, are being explored. These materials would be placed between teeth or in pits and fissures of teeth. Toothpastes and mouth rinses that can reverse and ""heal"" early cavities are also being studied.']"

Pregnant women in the first or second stage of this sexually transmitted disease ( STD ) pass it to their babies 75% of the time if it’s not treated. Syphilis is caused by bacteria and can create serious problems during a baby’s development. Many babies who get it before birth won’t survive full term, or will die shortly after they’re born. Almost half of babies will be stillborn. Babies born with syphilis can have misshapen bones, anemia , meningitis , skin rashes , and nerve problems that can cause blindness and deafness . If you’re pregnant, you should be tested for syphilis. If you test positive, your doctor can treat it with antibiotics . Fifth disease. This disease is caused by parvovirus B19. It’s seldom a problem for pregnant women or their babies. About half of women are immune to the virus, so their babies won’t get fifth disease. Those babies that do can get anemia . Less than 5% of the time, women have problems that cause them to miscarry.', 'Since there’s no vaccine or medication to prevent fifth disease, it’s important to wash your hands with soap and water often, and avoid being around sick people.

That’s why it’s important to tell your doctor right away if you think you might have gotten it. Because of the measles - mumps -rubella (MMR) vaccine , the disease is rare in children. There are only about 30 to 60 known cases of it each year in the United States, and fewer than five babies a year are born with it. There’s no cure for congenital rubella syndrome , so prevention is key. If you’re thinking of becoming pregnant and you haven’t already had the MMR vaccine , you should get it at least 28 days before you conceive.', 'Cytomegalovirus Also known as CMV , cytomegalovirus is an infection in the herpes virus group. And it’s estimated that 50% of adults have it by the time they’re 30. There is no cure for CMV, but it gets better on its own very quickly and doesn’t cause serious problems -- unless you’re pregnant.', 'If you’re pregnant, you can pass it to your unborn child. In fact, CMV is the most common viral infection passed on to babies in the U.S. -- about 1 in 150 births. About 1 in 5 babies born with congenital CMV will get sick or have long-term issues from it, including: Hearing and vision loss Jaundice Small birth size Lung problems Seizures Muscle weakness Mental disabilities', 'Herpes Simplex Like CMV, herpes is a lifelong infection, but it can be inactive for periods of time. It’s also very common – more than 50% of people in the U.S. have it by the time they reach their 20s. There are two kinds of herpes : HSV-1, which can cause blisters around the mouth , but can also be passed to the genitals. HSV-2 is an STD that causes genital herpes, and can cause blisters or open sores on the genitals or anus . It can also cause oral herpes .', ""You can pass herpes to your baby in several ways: They can get the virus while they're in the uterus. This is rare. You could have a genital outbreak during delivery. This is the most common way babies are infected. They can also get herpes while they are a newborn ."", 'The greatest risk to your baby is if you get your first outbreak of herpes while you’re pregnant. That’s because during your first outbreak, you shed more particles of the virus and for a longer period of time. Your body has fewer antibodies to fight the virus than it will during future outbreaks. If you’re pregnant and get herpes later in your pregnancy, the chances of passing it on to your baby could be higher. Talk to your doctor about your concerns. If you have an active outbreak when it’s time to deliver your baby, it may be best for you to have a C-section, and you may need to take other precautions.']"
54,"What Is My Rotator Cuff, and Why Does It Hurt?","['What Is a Rotator Cuff? Your rotator cuff is made up of muscles and tendons that keep the ball (head) of your upper arm bone (humerus) in your shoulder socket. It also helps you raise and rotate your arm. It’s a complicated process that your body makes look easy. Rotator cuff muscles Each one of the following muscles is part of the rotator cuff and plays an important role: Supraspinatus. This holds your humerus in place, keeps your upper arm stable, and helps lift your arm. Infraspinatus. This is the main muscle that lets you rotate and extend your shoulder. Teres minor. This is the smallest rotator cuff muscle. Its main job is to help with rotation of your arm away from your body. Subscapularis. This holds your upper arm bone to your shoulder blade and helps you rotate your arm, hold it straight out, and lower it. These muscles are attached to your arm bone with tendons that form a covering (cuff) over the ball of the humerus. Your rotator cuff helps you do things like get something off a high shelf and comb your hair. It’s especially important in sports like baseball, swimming , and tennis. This part of your body is made up of muscles and tendons. They keep your arm and shoulder together and allow you to move your arm. (Photo Credit: Suriya Siritam/Dreamstime)', ""Rotator Cuff Injuries Rotator cuff tear . The tendons in your shoulder can become frayed, partially torn, or completely detached from the bone. It's often the result of wear and tear from daily use over time. You’re more likely to have this if you have a job where you need to move your arm a certain way over and over, like a painter or a carpenter, or you play sports like tennis and baseball. It also can happen suddenly if you fall on your arm or try to lift something heavy. Rotator cuff tendinopathy . Formerly called tendinitis , this is inflammation or irritation of a tendon that attaches to a bone. It causes pain in the area just outside the joint. Common types of tendinopathy include pitcher’s and swimmer’s shoulder. Bursitis . The bursa (a small sac filled with fluid that protects your rotator cuff) can get irritated when you repeat the same motion over and over again, like throwing a baseball or lifting something over your head. Bursitis also can be caused by an infection."", 'Symptoms of Rotator Cuff Injury A rotator cuff tear or other injury may cause: Dull pain in your shoulder Weakness in your arm Trouble sleeping Pain that appears when you touch your head or reach behind your back Rotator cuff pain can limit the range of motion in your arm. You may feel grinding or crackling when you move your shoulder. Sometimes, you can have a rotator cuff injury and feel no pain at all.', ""Diagnosing Shoulder Pain To diagnose your shoulder pain, your doctor will move your arm around, press on or around your shoulder, and test the strength of muscles in your shoulder and arms. You can't see a rotator cuff tear on an X-ray, but your doctor will be able to see other injuries to your shoulder such as arthritis or bone spurs. You may have other tests, including: Ultrasound, which shows soft tissue areas such as tendons and muscles and how your shoulder looks as it's moving. Your technician can scan your other shoulder to see how the two compare. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) , which can provide detailed images of the structure of your shoulder."", ""Rotator Cuff Injury Treatment Most rotator cuff injuries get better over time without any kind of aggressive treatment. For tendinitis, bursitis, or a minor tear, your doctor may recommend: Rest, including avoiding repetitive motions or overhead sports (tennis, baseball, volleyball, swimming , and others) A combination of ice and heat Over-the-counter pain relievers like aspirin , ibuprofen , and naproxen Physical therapy, which includes stretching and strengthening exercises to get you more mobile If you still have pain and other symptoms after treating your rotator cuff injury at home, you may need different treatment. Steroid injections A shot of cortisone into the joint may help if your shoulder pain keeps you from sleeping or limits your daily activities. While they can provide quick pain relief, steroid shots can eventually weaken your tendons. Surgery About 80% to 85% of rotator cuff injuries are improved without surgery. Your doctor may recommend it if you're still in pain after trying other treatments. But it will depend on your age, your overall health, and what kinds of activities you do. There's no harm in trying nonsurgical options first. Doctors have found no difference in surgery outcomes if you have it right away or wait."", 'Surgery may be the first choice, though, if you tore a tendon completely during a fall or other accident. There are several types of surgeries for rotator cuff tears, depending on how serious your injury is. You may have the tendon reattached to the bone, or you may need your shoulder completely rebuilt.', ""Preventing Rotator Cuff Injuries Your rotator cuff can tear again after treatment or surgery, so it's important to prevent another injury. Here's what you can do: Protect your joint . Ask your doctor what movements and activities you should avoid to give your shoulder a chance to heal. Be cautious when you raise your arms over your head, and don't hold heavy items out away from your body. Pay attention to your posture, and if you do sports, check with a trainer to be sure you're using good form. Strengthen. Building up the muscles in and around your shoulder will help keep your rotator cuff stable and lessen pain. Focus on the muscles in all parts of your shoulder, in your upper back, and in your arms."", ""Get more flexible. After strengthening, gentle stretching will restore your shoulder's range of motion, reduce achiness, and lengthen your muscles. You'll get the best results from a shoulder conditioning program if you do your exercises two to three times a week. Before you start, talk with your doctor or physical therapist about the best kinds of exercise to do."", 'Rotator Cuff Exercises How to strengthen the rotator cuff Before starting your exercise program, take stock of the range of motion in your shoulder. This will help you rate your progress. Begin your exercises slowly. Stop when you start to feel pain. Warm up for 10 minutes before starting your exercises with a low-impact activity such as cycling on a stationary bike or walking. Practice good posture in your shoulders: While sitting or standing, focus on pulling them down and holding them down. Ice your shoulder for about 20 minutes a day. The following are easy exercises to do at home with little or no equipment. Pendulum. Place one hand on a table or countertop and lean forward. Your other arm should hang loosely at your side. Keep your back straight and bend your knees. Swing your arm gently back and forth, then from side to side, and finally in a circle. Repeat with your other arm for two sets of 10 repetitions.', ""Shoulder stretch . Relax your shoulders and bring one arm across your chest. Bend your other arm and use it to pull the extended arm closer to your chest. Don't pull on your elbow. Hold the position for 30 seconds and relax for 30 seconds more. Do that four times, then repeat on the other side. Sleeper stretch . Lie on your side on a firm surface with the injured shoulder down. Extend your affected arm straight forward and bend your elbow at a 90-degree angle so your hand points toward the ceiling. Using your other hand, grasp your arm above the wrist and press it down toward your hip. Stop when you feel a stretch in the back of your affected shoulder. Hold this position for 30 seconds and relax for 30 seconds more. Repeat four times, three times a day. Elbow flex . Choose a weight that you can lift for three sets of eight repetitions. Stand, holding a weight in each hand with your elbows close to your sides. Slowly bend one arm, bringing the weight toward your shoulder and hold for 2 seconds. Return the weight slowly to your starting position. Repeat with the other arm. Increase the weight a pound at a time as the exercise gets easier, with a 10- to 15-pound maximum weight. Elbow pull . Attach the center of a resistance band to the knob of a closed door or another stable object. Facing the anchor point, take the ends of the band in each hand and hold your elbows bent at your sides. Step back until you feel tension. Steadily push both elbows back and then slowly return your arms to their starting position, squeezing your shoulder blades together as you pull. Do three sets of eight pulls.""]"
55,Understanding Dystonia: A Comprehensive Guide,"[""What Is Dystonia? Dystonia is a neurological disorder that causes painful muscle spasms. (Photo Credit: Sebastian Kaulitzki/Science Photo Library/Getty Images) Dystonia is a movement disorder in which some of your body's muscles contract in ways you can't control. This can cause your body to twist and move in awkward ways. Dystonia can affect one muscle, a muscle group, or your entire body. Dystonia affects about 1% of the population, and you're more likely to have it if you're assigned female at birth. Dystonia vs. dyskinesia Dystonia is sometimes confused with dyskinesia. Dyskinesia is one type of dystonia; it happens when muscles tense up for a longer period, which triggers involuntary movements that might seem jerky."", 'Dystonia Symptoms The main symptom of dystonia is uncontrollable muscle movements that can range from very mild to severe. Dystonia can affect different body parts, and often the signs progress through stages. Some early symptoms include: A ""dragging leg"" Cramping of your foot Involuntary pulling of your neck Uncontrollable blinking Trouble speaking Handwriting that gets worse after you write a few lines Tremor Stress or fatigue may bring on your symptoms or cause them to worsen. You may also have pain and exhaustion because of the constant muscle contractions.', 'If dystonia symptoms appear in childhood, they usually involve your foot or hand. But then they progress to the rest of the body. After the teen years, though, the symptoms tend to level off. When dystonia appears in early adulthood, it typically begins in your upper body. Symptoms take a while to progress to the rest of your body.', ""Dystonia Causes Most cases of dystonia don't have a specific cause. Dystonia seems to be related to a problem in your basal ganglia, the part of your brain that controls your muscle contractions. The problem involves the way the nerve cells communicate. Dystonia is divided into three categories: genetic, acquired, and idiopathic. Genetic dystonia If you have genetic dystonia, it means that the problem stems from an abnormal gene you inherited. There are several genes that are linked to dystonia, including: DYT1 . Mutations to this gene cause DYT1 dystonia, a rare form that begins in childhood and affects the arms and legs first. It can cause serious disability. DYT3 . Changes in this gene have been linked to tremor, muscle stiffness, and slow movements (similar to Parkinson's disease). DYT5 mutations may cause dopa-responsive dystonia (DRD), which is also called Segawa’s disease. Symptoms usually start in childhood and tend to worsen after physical activity as well as later in the day. DRD symptoms can often be well-controlled with levodopa (Sinemet), which is also used to treat Parkinson’s disease. DYT6 gene changes can cause dystonia in your head, neck, and arms. DYT11 mutations cause brief muscle contractions called myoclonus. DYT12 genetic issues cause Parkinson’s-like dystonia symptoms that come on quickly. DYT28 issues cause dystonia that starts in childhood."", ""Acquired dystonia Acquired dystonia is also known as secondary dystonia and is caused by damage to your basal ganglia, usually as a result of: Brain trauma Stroke Tumor Being deprived of oxygen, perhaps during birth Infection Poisoning caused by carbon monoxide or heavy metals such as lead Drug interactions Dystonia caused by a reaction to a drug is known as tardive dystonia. The symptoms are typically only short-term and can be treated with medication. Unlike genetic dystonia, acquired dystonia typically impacts one part of your body and it usually doesn't spread. Idiopathic dystonia Idiopathic means that doctors don't know the cause. Many types of dystonia happen for no clear reason."", 'Dystonia Diagnosis There is no single test used to diagnose dystonia. To figure it out, your doctor will assess your symptoms and personal and family histories and also do a physical exam. You will also likely have several tests, including blood and urine tests and tests of your cerebrospinal fluid (the fluid that surrounds your brain and spinal cord).', 'You may also need genetic tests to see if you carry a mutation that has been linked to dystonia. And you may have neurological tests such as EEG (electroencephalography) or EMG (electromyography). Unless you clearly have an inherited dystonia, your doctor may also order tests to rule out other conditions that could cause similar symptoms.', 'Dystonia Types Dystonia is a complex condition, and neurologists use two “axes” to classify it. Axis 1 focuses on the different ways doctors ID the disease. Axis 2 is how dystonia is separated into etiologies (causes). Dystonia axes Axis 1: This focus is on things like age when it started; number and span of body parts affected; and whether the dystonia is an isolated problem or part of another movement disorder. Axis 2: This takes into account the cause of the disease, like a brain lesion or injury that affects how well your nerves work; or if the dystonia is inherited (genetic), acquired, or idiopathic (no known cause). Dystonia is further grouped by the body part it affects:', ""Cervical dystonia Also known as torticollis, cervical dystonia is the most common type and typically happens in middle age, although anyone can get it. Cervical dystonia affects your neck muscles, causing your head to twist and turn or be pulled backward or forward. Blepharospasm This type of dystonia affects your eyes and usually begins with blinking that you can't control. At first, it affects just one eye, but over time, both eyes are involved. The spasms cause your eyelids to close, and sometimes they remain closed. You still have normal vision, but the closing of your eyelids makes you functionally blind. Laryngeal dystonia Also called spasmodic dysphonia, this affects your throat muscles that help you speak. This type of dystonia might make your voice weak or sound hoarse or breathy, and it may be hard for others to understand what you’re saying. Oromandibular dystonia This dystonia can cause problems with speech and swallowing, as it causes spasms of the jaw, lips, and tongue muscles."", ""Cranial dystonia This can affect your head, face, and neck. Some people have cranial dystonia as well as blepharospasm; the combination is sometimes called Meige syndrome. Myoclonus dystonia Myoclonus dystonia combines the muscle contractions of dystonia with twitching (myoclonus). It strikes the neck, torso, and arms. Task-specific dystonia This only happens when you're doing a repeated activity. Writer's cramp is a type of task-specific dystonia that happens while you're writing. It affects the hand and/or forearm muscles. Another example is musician’s dystonia, which may impact your hand (in keyboard or string players), the mouth and lips (in musicians who play wind instruments), or the voice (in singers)."", 'Dystonia Treatment Dystonia can’t be prevented, and there isn’t any way to slow its progress. But there are treatments that may lessen your symptoms. Your doctor can suggest one or more treatments based on the type of dystonia you have. Medication Medications can help reduce the ""overdrive"" messages that cause your muscles to contract too much in dystonia. Drugs options may include: Levodopa (Sinemet) and tetrabenazine (Nitoman) act on the dopamine system in your brain. Dopamine, a neurotransmitter, plays a role in controlling muscle movement. Benztropine (Cogentin), procyclidine hydrochloride (Kemadrin), and trihexyphenidyl (Artane) are in a class known as anticholinergic agents. They work by blocking a neurotransmitter called acetylcholine. Baclofen (ED Baclofen), clonazepam (Klonopin),\xa0diazepam (Valium), and lorazepam (Ativan) are GABAergic agents, which means that they regulate the neurotransmitter GABA. Botulinum toxin (Botox, Xeomin) is a medication that prevents muscle contractions in a specific area of your body. It must be given by a health care provider (who injects the medication into your affected muscles) and repeated about every 3 months.', ""Surgery If medications don’t relieve your symptoms, or if they cause too many side effects, your doctor might suggest surgery. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) : This involves placing an electrode into a specific area of your brain. It's then connected to a battery-powered device in your chest. The electrode transmits electrical pulses to your brain to reduce the muscle contractions. Other surgeries : For example, a surgeon might try to interrupt the small section of your brain that's causing the dystonia. Or they might cut or remove nerves that are triggering it. Speech, physical, or occupational therapy Your doctor might also suggest speech therapy, physical therapy, and stress management to treat your symptoms of dystonia. Speech therapy (and/or voice therapy) may help \xa0if you have laryngeal dystonia by strengthening the muscles used in speech. Physical therapy focuses on using movement to stretch and strengthen your body. The specific exercises that you do will depend on the type of dystonia you have. It’s best to work with a physical therapist who has experience treating neurological conditions. Occupational therapy is like physical therapy, but it focuses more on helping you do basic daily activities, such as getting dressed."", 'Alternative and complementary therapy Alternative and complementary therapies won’t cure dystonia, but they may help with your treatment. Check with your doctor to make sure any treatments are OK for you before trying them. Options may include: Yoga and Pilates may help you build strength and improve coordination. Massage can help improve your range of motion as well as prevent tightening of your muscles. Meditation , deep breathing, and other relaxation exercises can reduce your spasms by helping decrease your stress. Biofeedback entails working with a therapist who will teach you how to reduce muscle tension while they monitor your body’s response with an electrical device.', 'Dystonia Complications Depending on what type you have, dystonia can lead to several problems, both physical and emotional. Some of those include: Problems with vision, specifically with your eyelids Trouble moving your jaw, swallowing, or speaking Pain and fatigue Depression, anxiety, and withdrawal', 'Things You Can Do at Home Dystonia requires medical treatment, but there are some things you can do at home to help ease your symptoms. They include: Putting heat or ice on painful muscles Finding ways to manage stress, like deep breathing and reaching out to loved ones for support Trying “sensory tricks.” You may be able to temporarily stop a muscle spasm simply by touching that part of the body or a nearby body part.', ""Foods to avoid with dystonia There is no evidence that diet affects dystonia, so it’s best to eat a normal, nutritious diet that that suits your needs and symptoms. But you may want to limit or avoid foods and drinks with caffeine. Caffeine is a stimulant that might make your symptoms worse. Be sure to check with your health care provider before making any major changes to your diet. Vitamins and supplements haven’t been proven to help dystonia, either. If you’re thinking of trying one, it’s very important to check with your provider first. You want to make sure that it’s safe and won't interact with any of your medications."", ""Takeaways Dystonia is a very complex neurological movement disorder that forcibly cramps your muscles and won't let them relax . It can affect people of all ages and any part of your body, including your arms, legs, torso, face, and vocal cords. Doctors don't know what causes dystonia, but they think it might have something to do with a change in the part of your brain that controls muscle movements. You can inherit the disorder genetically, or have it after brain trauma. Dystonia is usually treated with medicines or surgery."", ""Dystonia FAQs Does dystonia lead to MS? There is no scientific proof that dystonia causes MS. Dystonia is one of several common movement disorders that are symptoms of multiple sclerosis, but it does not cause MS. What is the life expectancy of someone with dystonia? If you're diagnosed with dystonia, your life expectancy shouldn't change. If your dystonia is a symptom of another disease that causes damage to your nervous system, talk to your doctor about how that may affect your lifespan.""]"
56,What Is Torticollis?,"['Torticollis is a condition of the neck muscles that causes the head to tilt down. The term comes from two Latin words: tortus, which means twisted, and collum, which means neck . Sometimes it’s called “wryneck” or “loxia.” If your baby has the condition at birth, it’s called congenital muscular torticollis. That’s the most common type. Congenital forms of torticollis are usually painless. Babies can also develop infant torticollis after birth. Then it’s called “acquired,” rather than congenital. Acquired torticollis may be linked to other, more serious medical issues, and it could be quite painful. Adults can also develop wryneck after a head or neck injury. Or, the condition might occur as a side effect of certain medications. If your baby has acquired torticollis, there are stretching exercises that may help. (Photo credit: Eric Olson/WebMD)', 'Torticollis Causes You have a long muscle on each side of your neck that runs from the back of your ear to your collarbone. It is called the sternocleidomastoid, or SCM. When your baby has torticollis, this ropy muscle is shortened on one side. Why does the muscle become shortened? Your baby might have been cramped in the womb or may have been in an abnormal position, such as a breech position. That can put extra pressure on one side of your infant ’s head, which can cause the SCM to tighten.', 'If your doctor used forceps or a vacuum device during delivery, those also might have put pressure on your baby’s SCM. Torticollis causes in infants Your baby’s womb position and the tools used during their delivery aren’t the only reasons behind congenital torticollis. Other possible causes include: An abnormal development in the SCM Klippel-Feil syndrome (a rare birth defect that causes the vertebrae in your baby’s neck to fuse) Hematoma (a buildup of blood in your baby’s neck muscles) Fibrosis (thickening of your baby’s muscle tissue) Some possible causes of acquired torticollis are: Swelling in your child’s throat, which could be triggered by an infection, injury, or unknown cause Vision problems Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD: a condition where stomach acid irritates the lining of the tube that connects your mouth and stomach) A reaction to certain medicines Scar tissue Arthritis in the neck Sandifer syndrome (a movement disorder that causes muscle spasms due to acid reflux) Grisel’s syndrome (a rare side effect of surgeries that involve the head, neck, ear, nose, or throat)', 'Many times, wryneck occurs without any known cause. Doctors call this idiopathic torticollis. Torticollis causes in adults A type of torticollis, called cervical dystonia or spasmodic torticollis, typically affects adults. This form causes a person’s neck muscles to spasm. Some possible causes of cervical dystonia are: A head or neck injury A reaction to medications used to treat depression or other mental health conditions An inherited genetic mutation', 'Torticollis Symptoms Torticollis symptoms in infants You may not notice anything unusual about your baby for the first 6 or 8 weeks. It’s common for torticollis symptoms to become obvious once an infant gains more control of the head and neck. Some of the symptoms you might see: Your child’s head tilts to one side with their chin pointed to the opposite shoulder . In about 75% of babies with torticollis, the right side is affected. Their head doesn’t turn side to side or up and down easily. You feel a soft lump in your baby’s neck muscle. This isn’t dangerous and usually goes away within 6 months. Your baby prefers to look over the shoulder at you. Their eyes don’t follow you because that would require turning their head. Your baby has\xa0trouble breastfeeding on one side or prefers to feed on one side only. Your baby works hard to turn toward you, struggles to turn their head all the way, and becomes upset because the movement is hard. They\xa0might start getting a flat head on one or both sides, from lying in one position all the time. This is called “positional plagiocephaly.” One of your baby’s shoulders is higher than the other. Your baby has muscle tightness or stiffness. Your baby has swollen neck muscles. You notice that your baby has uneven facial features. For example, one eye might appear lower than the other.', 'Symptoms of acquired torticollis may include: Your child has severe neck pain or headaches. Their head tilts to one side, while their chin tilts to the other. Your child’s neck muscles are tight, stiff, or swollen. You notice that your child has limited movement in their head and neck. One of your child’s shoulders is higher than the other. Your child has head tremors (shaking or trembling movements). Torticollis symptoms in adults Some possible signs of torticollis in adults are: Spasms or tremors that cause your muscles to twitch, jerk, or shake Tense neck muscles Pain or burning in your shoulders, neck, or back Headaches Tilting your head forward, backward, or side to side Bending your neck and head forward, backward, or side to side Turning your head', 'Torticollis Diagnosis If you notice signs that look like your baby might have torticollis, set up an exam with your doctor. The doctor will start by checking how far your baby’s head will turn. They also may order imaging scans, such as X-rays, CT scans, MRIs, and ultrasound , to check for other conditions. A special test, called an electromyogram (EMG), can reveal which muscles are most affected. Blood tests are also used to rule out other conditions that are linked to torticollis. About 1 in 5 babies with torticollis will also have a hip problem.', 'Most babies with torticollis don’t have other medical problems. But it is sometimes linked to infections, broken bones, allergic reactions to medicines, or genetic conditions such as Down syndrome or Klippel-Feil syndrome. To diagnose torticollis in adults, doctors will typically perform a physical exam, ask about your family history, and assess your symptoms. Tests, such as MRI and EMG, usually aren’t necessary unless your doctor thinks your spinal cord is compressed or you have nerve damage. It’s important not to ignore symptoms that may be serious. Meningitis, a condition that causes inflammation of the membranes that cover your brain and spinal cord, may look like torticollis. You should get medical help right away if you experience symptoms of meningitis, such as: A sudden, high fever Chills A stiff neck Severe headache Confusion or trouble concentrating A skin rash', 'Torticollis Complications If you act early, you can help prevent any long-term effects of torticollis for your baby. Without treatment, your baby might get complications, including: Less control of their head Limited reach on the affected side and less tracking with the eyes Delays in sitting and walking A problem feeding Poor balance Crooked crawling Rolling onto one side only Facial deformities Flat head syndrome (from lying on the same side too much) Motor skill delays Problems with hearing and vision Torticollis in adults is linked to these complications: Balance problems Changes in the way you walk Bone spurs (bony lumps that develop on the edge of bones) A more serious underlying condition, such as an injury, tumor, or infection A disability that interferes with your everyday life Emotional issues', 'Torticollis Treatment Torticollis treatment in infants If your baby has acquired torticollis, treatment will focus on the condition that’s causing it. Most cases of congenital torticollis can be treated with stretching exercises or position changes that you can perform at home. The doctor may teach you some specific exercises to do with your little one. These moves will help lengthen the tighter, shorter muscle and also strengthen the muscle on the opposite side. Once torticollis is diagnosed and stretching exercises start, most babies improve within 6 months. Two things can speed up recovery: an early diagnosis and sticking to the treatment plan. Here are some other things you can do at home: Use your baby’s appetite as an incentive. Offer the bottle or your breast in a way that gets them to turn away from the favored side. Place toys so that your baby is forced to look both ways. Those with sounds and lights are really good at drawing their attention. Get them to play with their hands and feet. Babies like to bring their hands together and their feet up to their hands. When your baby does this, it builds up muscles they will need to crawl. Give them plenty of time on your tummy. Holding your baby this way will strengthen their back and neck muscles and keep the back of their head from flattening. Ideally, they should have 15 minutes of tummy time four times a day. You can support them on your chest, across your lap, or on a pillow if that makes it easier.', 'In addition to home treatment, your doctor may want your baby to see a physical therapist. Very rarely, children with torticollis will need surgery to lengthen the SCM muscle. Doctors will usually wait until your child is a preschooler to consider this option. Torticollis treatment in adults Treatment for torticollis in adults may depend on the cause. Some possible options include: Physical therapy, which may include heat therapy, massage, and traction devices to relieve pain Stretching exercises Braces or other devices to keep the neck in place Medicines, such as baclofen, to help with muscle spasms Anti-inflammatories to keep pain at bay Botox injections Trigger point injections Spine surgery if the condition is due to a vertebral dislocation Here are some home remedies that may help improve your symptoms: Stretch your neck muscles Apply hot and cold therapy Get enough rest Touch the opposite side of your face, neck, or chin to temporarily stop spasms Reduce stress', 'Torticollis Prevention While there’s no way to prevent torticollis in babies, you can avoid complications if you treat it early and stick to your treatment plan. Adults may be able to lessen their risk of torticollis if they avoid neck injuries and strains. It’s also helpful to practice good posture and perform stretching exercises often. You might not be able to completely prevent torticollis, but prompt treatment can keep the condition from getting worse.', 'Takeaways Torticollis can be present in babies at birth, acquired later in childhood, or even affect adults. It’s usually treated with at-home stretches and positioning. If these therapies aren’t successful for you or your child, let your doctor know. Other options may work better.', 'Torticollis FAQs How serious is torticollis? Torticollis is a relatively common condition that usually responds well to treatment. Rarely, torticollis can be a sign that you have a more serious underlying medical condition, such as a tumor, injury, or infection. Does torticollis go away on its own? Although torticollis can go away on its own, babies often need treatment to stretch their muscles. You should see your doctor for regular checkups to assess your baby’s progress. What causes torticollis in babies? There are lots of possible causes. The way your baby was positioned in the womb before birth is one. Other reasons include a problem with the muscles and nerves in the neck or a birth condition.', 'Should I be worried if my baby has torticollis? You shouldn’t worry if your doctor tells you your baby has torticollis. Most of the time, the condition usually doesn’t cause any pain and shouldn’t pose long-term issues if treated promptly. What triggers torticollis? The way babies are positioned in the womb before birth can trigger congenital torticollis. Swelling in a child’s throat can prompt acquired torticollis. In adults, a head or neck injury can sometimes be the culprit.']"
57,Tourette's Syndrome,"[""What Is Tourette's Syndrome? Tourette's syndrome is a problem with the nervous system that causes people to make sudden movements or sounds, called tics , that they can't control. For example, someone with Tourette's might blink or clear their throat over and over again. Some people may blurt out words they don't intend to say. Treatments can control tics , but some people don’t need any unless their symptoms really bother them. About 100,000 Americans have full-blown Tourette's syndrome , but more people have a milder form of the disease. It often starts in childhood, and more boys than girls get it. Symptoms often get better as children grow up. For some people, they go away completely."", ""Causes Tourette's has been linked to different parts of the brain , including an area called the basal ganglia, which helps control body movements. Differences there may affect nerve cells and the chemicals that carry messages between them. Researchers think the trouble in this brain network may play a role in Tourette's."", ""Doctors don't know exactly what causes these problems in the brain , but genes probably play a role. It's likely that there is more than one cause. People who have family members with Tourette's are more likely to get it themselves. But people in the same family may have different symptoms."", ""Symptoms The main symptom is tics. Some are so mild they're not even noticeable. Others happen often and are obvious. Stress , excitement, or being sick or tired can make them worse. The more severe ones can be embarrassing and can affect your social life or work. There are two types of tics: Motor tics involve movement. They include: Arm or head jerking Blinking Making a face Mouth twitching Shoulder shrugging Vocal tics include: Barking or yelping Clearing your throat Coughing Grunting Repeating what someone else says Shouting Sniffing Swearing Tics can be simple or complex. A simple tic affects one or just a few parts of the body, like blinking the eyes or making a face. A complex one involves many parts of the body or saying words. Jumping and swearing are examples."", ""Before a motor tic, you may get a sensation that can feel like a tingle or tension. The movement makes the sensation go away. You might be able to hold your tics back for a little while, but you probably can't stop them from happening. Doctors aren’t sure why, but about half of people with Tourette's also have symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ). You may have trouble paying attention, sitting still, and finishing tasks. Tourette’s can also cause problems with: Anxiety Learning disabilities such as dyslexia Obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD ) -- thoughts and behaviors you can't control, like washing your hands over and over again"", ""Getting a Diagnosis If you or your child has symptoms of Tourette's, your doctor may want you to see a neurologist, a specialist who treats diseases of the nervous system. There aren't any tests for the condition, but they'll ask you questions, like: What did you notice that brought you here today? Do you often move your body in a way you can’t control? How long has that been happening? Do you ever say things or make sounds without meaning to? When did it start? Does anything make your symptoms better? What makes them worse? Do you feel anxious or have trouble focusing? Does anyone else in your family have these kinds of symptoms? Your doctor may do imaging tests of your brain to rule out other conditions that have symptoms like those of Tourette's. They might include: MRI. It uses powerful magnets and radio waves to make pictures of organs and structures inside your body. CT scan. It's a powerful X-ray that makes detailed images of your insides."", 'Questions for Your Doctor How long will these symptoms last? Will they ever go away? Do I need any more tests? What kind of specialists do I need to see? Do I need any treatment? Do the treatments have any side effects? If I have children, what are the chances they will have Tourette’s? If your child has Tourette’s, you may also want to ask how long their tics might last or what you can do to help them deal with their symptoms at home and at school.', ""Treatment Many times, tics are mild and don't need to be treated. If they become a problem, your doctor may prescribe medicine to help them. It can take a while to find the right dose that helps control tics but avoids side effects, so be patient as you and your doctor work through it. Medications can include: Haloperidol ( Haldol ), fluphenazine ( Prolixin ), and pimozide ( Orap ), which work on a brain chemical called dopamine to control tics. Clonidine ( Catapres ) and guanfacine ( Tenex , Intuniv)), high blood pressure drugs that can also treat tics. Fluoxetine ( Prozac ),\xa0paroxetine ( Paxil ), sertraline ( Zoloft ), and other antidepressants , which can relieve anxiety , sadness, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms."", 'Along with medicine, you may want to consider talk therapy. A psychologist or counselor can help you learn how to deal with the social issues your tics and other symptoms may cause. Behavior therapy may also help. A specific kind, called habit-reversal training, teaches you how to recognize that a tic is coming and then move in a way that stops it.', ""Taking Care of Yourself Often the hardest part of living with Tourette's is dealing with the embarrassment or frustration of having tics you can't control. While you're getting help from your doctor, you can do a few other things to feel better: Get support . Your family, friends, health care team, or a support group can help you meet the challenges of Tourette's. Stay active. Play sports, paint, or volunteer. These activities will take your mind off your symptoms. Relax. Read a book, listen to music, meditate, or do yoga . Low-key activities you enjoy can combat the stress that can lead to tics."", ""Educate yourself . Learn everything you can about your condition so you'll know what to do when you have symptoms. If your child has Tourette’s, talk to their school about it. You can give staff the facts about the condition and see what kind of support they can give them, like extra tutoring or smaller classes. Fitting in socially also can be hard for a child with the disease. Help them practice ways to handle teasing or comments from other kids."", 'What to Expect In most cases, kids grow out of their tics by their late teens or early 20s. A few will have them for the rest of their lives, but their symptoms may get better as they get older.', 'Getting Support For more information on Tourette’s syndrome or to find others who are facing its challenges, visit the web site of the national Tourette Syndrome Association .']"
58,Life-Threatening Skin Rashes,"['Rashes are common conditions with a variety of causes. Most rashes are not dangerous, but are rather a mere nuisance. Life-threatening skin rashes are rare, but when they do occur, you must seek immediate medical help. Five potentially life-threatening disorders that have skin rash as the primary symptom are: Pemphigus vulgaris (PV) Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSS) All of these diseases have one or more of the following features: The rash affects the entire body, or most of it. The rash affects both the skin and the mucous membranes. Mucous membranes are the moist linings of the following: Mouth and nose Eyes Anus/rectum Vagina or urethra, the opening for urine, in women and those assigned female at birth (AFAB) Urethra, opening at the tip of the penis, in men and those assigned male at birth (AMAB) Rashes have blisters on top of them. Blisters that accompany a serious rash usually have the following features: Blisters involve the thin outer layer of the skin that covers large parts of the body. This may mean several small blisters about 1 cm across or a few very large blisters several centimeters wide. Blisters are tense (full of fluid) at first, and then may become loose before breaking open. When they do rupture, the skin underneath is moist and usually painful. The underlying skin surface then dries up and crusts over. Pressing on a tense blister or scratching the skin next to a blister will extend the blister and make it larger. This is a common feature of these skin disorders. Blisters can involve any or all of the mucous membranes just listed. Blisters in these areas may not be noticeable because they rupture easily, especially in the mouth. Blisters on the mucous membranes that rupture may be very painful. When they occur in the mouth, pain makes it hard to eat or even drink.']"
59,Rare Types of Anemia,"['Think of your red blood cells as the transport system that carries oxygen to your body’s tissues. When you have anemia , your body doesn’t make enough red blood cells , or these cells don’t work as well as they should. You end up feeling weak, tired , and short of breath. Anemia comes in many forms. Iron-deficiency anemia is most common. Other types of the disease affect only small numbers of people. Here’s a look at some of the rare types of anemia and how they’re treated.', 'Aplastic (or Hypoplastic) Anemia Blood cells are made from stem cells in your bone marrow. When you have aplastic anemia , stem cells in your bone marrow are damaged and can’t make enough new\xa0blood cells. You’re either born with aplastic anemia, meaning you inherited a gene from your parents that caused it, or you develop it (acquired). Acquired aplastic anemia is the more common of the two, and sometimes it’s only temporary.', 'Acquired causes include: Autoimmune diseases such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis Chemicals such as pesticides, arsenic, and benzene Infections including hepatitis , Epstein-Barr virus, and HIV Radiation and chemotherapy treatments for cancer Inherited conditions such as Fanconi anemia, Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, and Diamond-Blackfan anemia, can damage cells and also cause aplastic anemia. Symptoms of aplastic anemia can include everything from shortness of breath and dizziness to headaches , pale skin , chest pain , fast heart rate ( tachycardia ), and cold hands and feet . One way to treat aplastic anemia is with a blood transfusion . You’ll get a donor’s blood through a vein. A stem cell transplant can also treat\xa0aplastic anemia. It replaces the damaged stem cells in your bone marrow with healthy cells.', ""Sideroblastic Anemia In this group of blood disorders , your body can't use iron to make hemoglobin -- the protein that carries oxygen in your blood. The iron buildup causes the formation of abnormal red blood cells called sideroblasts. There are two main types of sideroblastic anemia: Acquired sideroblastic anemia can be\xa0caused by exposure to certain chemicals or drugs ."", ""Hereditary sideroblastic anemia happens when a gene mutation\xa0disrupts normal hemoglobin production. This gene produces “heme,” the part of hemoglobin that carries oxygen. Symptoms for both types include: Chest pain Fast heartbeat, or tachycardia Headaches Trouble breathing Weakness and fatigue Treatment for sideroblastic anemia depends on the cause. If you have acquired anemia, you'll need to avoid the chemical or drug that caused it. Other treatments include vitamin B6 therapy\xa0and bone marrow or stem cell transplants."", ""Myelodysplastic Syndromes Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are diseases that are caused when your bone marrow is damaged and can't make enough healthy blood cells. MDS is a type of cancer ."", 'Some people are born with a gene that causes MDS. These genes are usually passed down from one or both parents. If you have certain inherited syndromes, including Fanconi anemia, Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, Diamond Blackfan anemia, familial platelet disorder, and severe congenital neutropenia , you could be more likely to develop MDS. A small number of people also get MDS after radiation or chemotherapy treatment for cancer . Another risk is exposure to chemicals like benzene, which is found in tobacco smoke. Some people don’t have symptoms with MDS, but others do, including: Bruising or bleeding Infection Fever Shortness of breath Weakness and fatigue Weight loss Oncologists (cancer doctors) and hematologists (blood doctors) treat MDS with chemotherapy, hematopoietic growth factors,\xa0and stem cell or bone marrow transplants .', ""Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia Autoimmune hemolytic anemia happens when your body's immune system attacks and destroys red blood cells faster than it can make new ones. If you have an autoimmune disease like lupus , you’re also more likely to get this type of anemia. Medicines such as methyldopa ( Aldomet ), penicillin , and quinine ( Qualaquin ) can also cause autoimmune hemolytic anemia."", 'Symptoms include fatigue, pale skin, fast heartbeat (tachycardia), trouble breathing, chills, backache, and yellow skin ( jaundice ). Treating the disease that caused the anemia can also stop your red blood cell damage. If you have an autoimmune disease, your doctor might treat you with steroid drugs to calm your immune system , which can help the anemia.', 'Congenital Dyserythropoietic Anemia (CDA) CDA is a group of inherited anemias that reduce the number of healthy red blood cells in the body. All CDAs are passed down through families. There are three types of CDA, types 1, 2, and 3. Type 2 is the most common and type 3 is the rarest. Symptoms include chronic anemia, fatigue, yellow skin and eyes (jaundice), pale skin, and missing fingers and toes at birth. Some people never need treatment. But depending on the severity of the disease, your doctor might recommend a blood transfusion, a stem cell transplant, or medicines to lower iron levels or interferon alfa-2A, a drug typically used for treating leukemia and melanoma .', ""Diamond-Blackfan Anemia If you have Diamond-Blackfan anemia, your bone marrow doesn't make enough red blood cells. Doctors think it is caused by changes to your genes. Symptoms of Diamond-Blackfan anemia include: Fast heartbeat (tachycardia) Fatigue Heart murmur Irritability Pale skin Short height Sleepiness Weak bones Treatments include everything from steroids that can help produce more red blood cells to red blood cell transfusions and bone marrow transplants."", ""Megaloblastic Anemia With this type of anemia, your bone marrow produces abnormally structured red blood cells that are too large and too young. Because they’re not mature or healthy, they can't carry oxygen throughout your body very well. Megaloblastic anemia is caused by too little vitamin B12 (cobalamin) or vitamin B9 (folate). Your body needs these vitamins to make red blood cells. Some people with megaloblastic anemia might not have symptoms for many years. But once symptoms do appear, they’re similar to other types of anemia, and include: Dizziness and fatigue Diarrhea , nausea Fast or irregular heartbeat (tachycardia) Muscle pain or weakness Pale skin Trouble breathing Doctors treat megaloblastic anemia with vitamin B9 and vitamin B12 supplements to replace what your body is missing. You'll also need treatment for any disease -- such as Crohn's -- that caused your body to lack these vitamins."", ""Fanconi Anemia Fanconi anemia makes your blood marrow produce too few blood cells. It's hereditary, meaning it’s passed down from one of your parents through a gene mutation. Symptoms and physical traits of Fanconi anemia include: Abnormal thumbs Easy bruising and bleeding Fatigue Frequent infections Heart , kidney , and bone problems Skin color changes Small body, head, and eyes If you have Fanconi anemia, you’re more likely to get a type of cancer called acute myeloid leukemia , or AML. Your odds of getting cancers of the head, neck, skin, GI tract, or genitals also go up. Treatment depends on several factors, including what stage it’s in and the severity of physical complications. Treatments include hormone therapy and growth factors to boost blood cell growth. If symptoms become severe, your doctor might recommend a bone marrow stem cell transplant. Oftentimes a bone marrow transplant can cure the problems altogether.""]"
60,Toxic Shock Syndrome,"[""What Is Toxic Shock Syndrome? Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a sudden, potentially deadly condition caused when an overgrowth of bacteria releases toxins into your bloodstream. Tampons can cause toxic shock syndrome if they're used incorrectly. Education and changes in manufacturing have brought some case rates down. (Photo Credit: Moment/Getty Images) Two kinds of bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, are to blame for most cases. It's rare, and it usually comes from using tampons or having a cut or burn that gets infected. If you get it, you'll need immediate medical care to prevent serious complications. Depending on which kind of bacteria causes it, how quickly you get treatment, and your overall health, it can be fatal 30%-70% of the time."", 'Toxic Shock Syndrome Symptoms When it starts, TSS causes the same symptoms as a lot of other less serious illnesses. They come on suddenly and include: A high fever and chills Muscle aches Vomiting and diarrhea Headache Sore throat Symptoms get worse fast, and you can also have: Low blood pressure A rash that looks like a sunburn, especially on your palms and bottoms of your feet Red eyes, mouth, and throat Confusion Seizures', ""After about a week, the rash from TSS can cause your skin to peel in large sheets. What does TSS feel like? You may feel like you have the flu at first. But you'll quickly feel much sicker as the toxins from the infection start to damage your organs.Pay special attention to symptoms like a sudden high fever and vomiting if you're on your period or if you have an open wound or a skin infection. If you're using a tampon, menstrual sponge, diaphragm, or cervical cap when you get sick, take it out right away, even before you call the doctor."", ""Toxic Shock Syndrome Causes Three different kinds of bacteria can cause TSS: Staphylococcus aureus (staph) Streptococcus pyogenes (group A strep) Clostridium sordellii Staph lives normally on many peoples' bodies without causing problems. But it's also responsible for a lot of infections in people with serious burns or who've had surgery. Group A strep causes many less-serious infections like strep throat and impetigo. Clostridium sordellii can also live harmlessly inside your vagina."", 'TSS happens when certain conditions allow these bacteria to grow and spread quickly and start releasing poisons. Then they get into your bloodstream through a break in your skin or mucus membranes. Some things that can cause you to get TSS include: Tampon or other device left inside your vagina for too long Skin infection Postsurgical infection Childbirth, abortion, or other gynecological procedure Gauze or other packing used to stop a nosebleed or surgical bleeding Why do tampons cause TSS? This condition made headlines in the late 1970s and early 1980s after the deaths of women who were using super-absorbent tampons. A saturated tampon is a place where bacteria can grow quickly. It can then travel into the uterus through the cervix. In some cases resulting from menstrual sponges, diaphragms, and cervical caps, the device had been in the vagina for a long time—more than 30 hours. It also seems to matter what the tampon is made of. Polyester foam is worse than either cotton or rayon fibers.', ""Sliding a tampon into place could make microscopic tears in your vaginal walls that can let bacteria in. Leaving a super-absorbent tampon in too long or using it when your flow is light can dry out your vagina, making tearing even more likely. The kinds of super-absorbent tampons that were involved in the earlier cases aren't made anymore. And now tampon makers have to use standard labeling and measurements for absorbency, and include instructions for how to use them safely. Tampon-related cases of TSS have dropped since the '80s."", ""Risk Factors for Toxic Shock Syndrome You're more likely to get TSS if you: Use tampons, especially if they're super-absorbent or left in longer than recommended Have broken skin from a cut, burn, or bug bite Are recovering from surgery Have a skin infection like impetigo or cellulitis Have strep throat or a viral infection like the flu or chickenpox Recently had a baby, a miscarriage, or an abortion Use a diaphragm or other device that goes inside your vagina Needed gauze packing to stop a nosebleed Have had TSS before Are very young, very old, have a weakened immune system, or a chronic medical condition"", 'Toxic Shock Syndrome Diagnosis Doctors test for TSS in several ways: Test blood and urine samples for a staph or strep infection. Take a swab of your vagina, cervix, or throat. Take a swab from an infected wound. Test your blood for cell counts and enzyme levels that show how well your organs are working. Measure how quickly your blood clots. Use a CT scan, spinal tap, or chest X-ray to look for other signs TSS is affecting your organs.', ""Toxic Shock Syndrome Treatment TSS is an emergency situation, and you'll need to go to the hospital. You may be treated with: Antibiotics given through a vein in your arm Antibodies from donated blood to help fight the infection Medicine for low blood pressure Fluid to replace your body's loss of water Extra oxygen If the bacteria causing the TSS is coming from badly infected tissue, you may have to have surgery to remove it. You may need dialysis if your kidneys are damaged."", ""Complications of Toxic Shock Syndrome TSS can cause widespread damage in your body. You may go into shock, and your organs could shut down. Complications can include: Kidney failure Liver failure Excessive bleeding because your blood won't clot correctly Tissue death The damage can be so serious that you might have to have fingers and toes or even limbs amputated. It can also be deadly."", ""How to Prevent Toxic Shock Syndrome TSS is rare, and you can take steps to make it less likely you'll get it. Keep burns, cuts, and other skin injuries clean. Follow your doctor's instructions for taking care of a surgical incision. Call your doctor right away if you notice signs a wound is infected, like redness, pain, or swelling. If you use tampons, use them correctly. Wash your hands before putting one in. Change tampons at least every 4-8 hours. Don't use a product with a higher absorbency than you need. Use pads instead of tampons some of the time. Make sure your hands are clean before putting any other period product or birth control device into your vagina, and don't leave them in longer than recommended. If you've had TSS once, you're more likely to get it again, so your doctor may tell you not to use these kinds of products."", 'Takeaways TSS is a rare, but very serious condition that can come from an infected cut or burn or from using tampons. Bacteria spread toxins through your bloodstream, which can cause major damage to your organs and even death. It comes on suddenly with symptoms like the flu and gets worse quickly.', ""Toxic Shock Syndrome FAQs What are the warning signs of TSS? TSS starts out with mild flu-like symptoms that get worse fast. You should suspect it if you suddenly feel very sick all over your body, especially if you've been using tampons or have an infected cut or burn. What are the major criteria of TSS? According to the CDC, TSS involves a fever, a rash, a dramatic drop in blood pressure, and evidence of serious organ damage. What is TSS typically caused by? Infections from two bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus (staph) and Streptococcus pyogenes ( group A strep), are responsible for most cases of TSS. They can get into your bloodstream through broken skin or mucus membranes. TSS can come from cuts, burns, or surgical incisions, or leaving tampons or other devices inside your vagina longer than recommended.""]"
61,Toxoplasmosis,"['What Is Toxoplasmosis? Toxoplasmosis is an infection caused by a parasite called Toxoplasma gondii. You can find it in the intestines of some animals, including cats and pigs. The infection can cause cysts to form in your body, usually in your brain and muscles, including your heart. But if your immune system is healthy, it isn’t likely to cause you any trouble. You can have toxoplasmosis without knowing it. It’s more likely to cause problems in people whose immune systems aren’t at full strength because of a health problem like HIV , or some types of cancer or cancer treatments. It also can be harmful to babies as they develop in the womb -- a pregnant woman can pass it to their baby. It can cause issues with the brain or eyes .', 'Toxoplasmosis Symptoms Toxoplasmosis symptoms in babies Babies may get toxoplasmosis if the mother has been infected just before or during the pregnancy, even if they don’t have signs of the disease. Many early infections end in stillbirth or miscarriage. If the baby survives, they may have serious problems like: Seizures Enlarged liver or spleen Jaundice (yellowing of skin and eyes) Serious eye infections', 'Often, babies with toxoplasmosis don’t show any signs of it at birth. The symptoms (like hearing loss, mental disability, or severe eye infections) show up in the teen years. Toxoplasmosis symptoms in older children and adults Symptoms of toxoplasmosis can feel a lot like the flu . They include: Headaches Body aches Fever Feeling more tired than usual If your immune system isn’t working like it should because of another health problem, you also may have more serious symptoms, such as: Confusion Lack of coordination Seizures Trouble breathing Blurred vision', 'Toxoplasmosis Causes and Risk Factors You might come into contact with the parasite if you: Clean out a cat’s litter box or touch anything that has touched infected cat feces Touch your mouth after gardening and accidently ingest parasites Drink water that has parasites in it Eat raw or undercooked meat, especially lamb, pork, or venison Use utensils that have been contaminated by raw meat Eat unwashed fruits or vegetables You also could be exposed to it if you’re an organ donor or have had a blood transfusion.', 'Toxoplasmosis Diagnosis If you have signs of toxoplasmosis, see your doctor. You also might want to talk with them about it if you want to get pregnant or you have a health problem that affects your immune system. If you have the infection, your body will make things called antibodies to try to fight it off. To find out if you have toxoplasmosis, your doctor can do a blood test to see if you have those antibodies. If you’ve been infected recently, your body may not have had time to make them. So even if your test doesn’t show any signs of them, your doctor may want to do another test a few weeks later to be sure. If the blood test shows you do have the antibodies, you’re likely in for another test. The CDC recommends that a lab that specializes in toxoplasmosis test your blood sample again to make sure the result is correct. If so, more tests can be done on your blood to find out when the infection started. If you have a serious illness such as encephalitis (a life-threatening brain infection), you may need imaging tests to check for cysts or lesions in your brain. These tests may include an MRI or a brain biopsy. With an MRI, you lie inside a machine that creates images of your brain and head using a magnetic field and radio waves. With a brain biopsy, a doctor takes a sample of brain tissue and has it checked for toxoplasmosis cysts.', 'Toxoplasmosis in Pregnancy If you find out you have toxoplasmosis while you’re pregnant, your doctor will want to see if it has passed to your baby. They may recommend one of these: Ultrasound .\xa0This uses sound waves to make images of the baby. It can show if fluid has built up in the brain , among other signs. Amniocentesis .\xa0Your doctor will use a long, thin needle to take a small bit of fluid from the area around the baby (the amniotic sac). The fluid will be tested for signs of the infection. You’ll need to be at least 15 weeks along before this test is done.', 'Toxoplasmosis Treatment Toxoplasmosis doesn’t cause problems for most people, so you probably won’t need treatment for it if your immune system is healthy. If you are\xa0HIV-positive \xa0or have AIDS, your doctor may recommend the antibiotic sulfadiazine , along with a medication usually used to treat malaria called pyrimethamine ( Daraprim ). For a pregnant woman whose baby hasn’t been affected, the doctor might prescribe an antibiotic called spiramycin. It’s used to treat toxoplasmosis in Europe but is still being tested in the United States. If your baby is also infected or is likely to be, the doctor may recommend sulfadiazine and pyrimethamine, but only after the 16th\xa0week of pregnancy. Your doctor will watch the baby closely for signs of problems.', 'Toxoplasmosis Complications If your immune system is normal,\xa0 toxoplasmosis is likely to not cause any complications. You’re at greater risk for serious health problems from toxoplasmosis infection if: You have HIV or AIDS. You are having chemotherapy, which affects your immune system. You’re taking steroids or other drugs with the side effect of suppressing your immune system. If you have a weakened immune system (especially because of HIV or AIDS), toxoplasmosis can be serious and cause seizures or encephalitis. People who have AIDS or encephalitis that isn’t treated can die from toxoplasmosis. Children with toxoplasmosis may have hearing loss, blindness, and mental disabilities.', 'Toxoplasmosis Prevention? You can do a few things to keep from coming into contact with the parasite: Wear gloves and wash your hands thoroughly after working outdoors or in a garden. If you have a sandbox, keep it covered to keep cats out of it. Thoroughly clean your hands, counters, cutting boards, utensils, and dishes with warm water and soap after preparing raw meat. Make sure food is cooked well, fruit and vegetables are thoroughly washed, and any water you drink has been treated. Avoid drinks that include things like unpasteurized goat’s milk and raw eggs. If you have a cat, here are few tips to make sure you and your family are safe around your feline friend: Keep your cat indoors so it doesn’t pick up the parasite. Do your best to keep your cat off counters where food is prepared. Feed your cat only dry or canned cat food. Cats can get it from raw or undercooked meat. Don’t touch stray cats or kittens. Clean the litter box every day. Only people who are healthy and aren’t pregnant should clean the litter box. Wear gloves when you clean the litter box, and wash your hands with soap and warm water. Boil the litter scoop in water for 5 minutes after each cleaning.', 'Toxoplasmosis Outlook For most healthy adults, toxoplasmosis doesn’t pose any problems. But women who are pregnant or people with compromised immune systems will have to take special care. People with AIDS who have recovered from toxoplasmosis are at a high risk for getting it a second time. To prevent this, they must take medication as long as their immune system is compromised. Children with toxoplasmosis who are treated at birth may not show any signs of the disease. If a pregnant woman is treated, the chances of the baby getting it drops 60%.']"
62,What Is Grover's Disease?,"['Grover’s disease is a rare, temporary skin condition. It causes sudden red, raised, blistery, and sometimes very itchy spots that form around the middle of the body. The rash is most often seen in middle-aged men. Another name for this condition is transient acantholytic dermatosis (TAD).', 'Who Gets It? Grover’s disease usually happens in men over 50. However, women sometimes get it, too.', 'What Causes It? Scientists aren’t sure what causes Grover’s disease. It may appear for no reason. Some doctors think that sun-damaged skin or extreme swings in temperature play a role. One popular, but unproven, theory is that it may be linked to sweating. Many cases have occurred in men who use hot tubs, steam rooms, electric blankets, and other warming items.\xa0It can also be caused by certain medications, organ transplants, kidney disease, Dialysis, or exposure to x rays.', 'What Are the Symptoms? The main symptoms of Grover’s disease are: Sudden rash on the chest, back, and sometimes arms and legs Blisters containing a thin, watery liquid with a hair follicle in the center Blisters clumped together, surrounded by a red swollen ring Itching, which may be intense Symptoms usually last about 6 to 12 months, but may go away sooner or take longer to disappear.', 'How Is It Diagnosed? Your doctor will examine you and the rash. Sometimes it can be tough to tell the difference between Grover’s disease and other skin disorders. A shaved skin biopsy can confirm the diagnosis.', 'How Is It Treated? If you have a mild rash, the first treatments may include: Antihistamines, taken by mouth Prescription cortisone cream, applied to the rash Other anti-itch lotions that contain menthol or camphor If your symptoms are very bad, your doctor may suggest retinoids or an antibiotic taken by mouth. But, these medicines can cause side effects (some may be severe). Always talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of the medications you are prescribed. Severe, stubborn symptoms can be hard to treat and may keep coming back. This could mean you need long-term treatment. Your doctor may prescribe light therapy combined with medications if this happens. Other treatments that may be used for severe symptoms are: Antifungal pills Antifungal lotions such as selenium sulfide Cortisone shots, Oral corticosteroids Antibiotics Systemic retinoid', 'Your doctor may also suggest you reduce activities that can cause a lot of sweating (like heavy-duty workouts), since sweating can worsen the rash. Your doctor might also recommend that you take fewer baths and showers, and that you don’t spend a lot of time in the sun.']"
63,Hereditary Transthyretin Amyloidosis (hATTR) With Polyneuropathy,"['What Is Hereditary Transthyretin Amyloidosis With Polyneuropathy? Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (hATTR) with polyneuropathy is a rare disorder passed down in families that gets worse over time. It’s a result of a change in a gene, also called a mutation. The mutated TTR gene in the liver makes abnormal shapes of a protein called transthyretin. These abnormal transthyretin proteins clump together in various organs and nerves to form deposits called amyloids. The deposits of amyloid damage organs and tissues. hATTR can cause serious complications and death. But symptoms can be managed through drugs and therapies. Your doctor might also use the word ""amyloidosis"" when talking about the condition. That\'s because hATTR is one of a group of diseases also known by that name. When you have hATTR, you may have a variety of symptoms when too much amyloid protein starts to collect in the nerves that branch out from your brain and spinal cord. This can affect your senses. For instance, you may be less likely to feel pain or heat, or you might have trouble walking. Or it could affect your hearing or vision.', 'The protein also gathers in the nerves that control important actions in your body, like blood pressure, heart rate, and digestion. You may have trouble going to the bathroom or having sex, or you may sweat too much. Your heart may beat too fast or too slowly. Serious symptoms that can be life-threatening include an enlarged heart and an irregular heartbeat. hATTR can affect people of almost any age, usually between their 30s and 70s.', 'hATTR Amyloidosis Symptoms Because hATTR can affect a number of organs and systems in your body, it can have a lot of symptoms. The most serious problems include heart enlargement and irregular heartbeats, the cause of death in many people with hATTR. You might have numbness, tingling, and swelling in your hands and feet. Or you could have problems like diarrhea, constipation, feeling full soon after you start eating, and trouble peeing. You might also feel very tired. Some eye problems you could get include: Cloudiness Dry eyes Increased pressure in the eye (glaucoma)', 'hATTR Amyloidosis Causes and Risk Factors As the name suggests, hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (hATTR) with polyneuropathy runs in families. If you have it, you got it from genes one or both of your parents passed to you. How common is it? The exact number of people who have hATTR isn’t known. In parts of Brazil, Japan, Portugal, and Sweden, the disease is considered endemic. That means it’s around all the time in certain areas. In northern Portugal, for instance, hATTR is common, with one in 538 diagnosed. In the U.S., an estimated 6,400 people have hATTR. Americans of European descent are more likely to have it, with one in 100,000 people diagnosed. Black and Irish Americans more commonly get it, but it can impact all ethnic groups. Men and women are equally affected. It’s likely that there are many more hATTR cases than reported. Because its symptoms are similar to those of other conditions, it’s often misdiagnosed.', ""hATTR Amyloidosis Diagnosis If you know hATTR runs in your family, your doctor will probably suggest you get a DNA test to see if you have the gene that causes it. They check a sample of your blood, cheek cells, or skin. It can be tough to diagnose hATTR. Your doctor will ask you about your health history to get clues, including: Have you or anyone in your family had heart failure or thickening of the heart muscle? Do you feel numbness or tingling in your hands or feet? Do you have digestive problems such as diarrhea or constipation? Are you having trouble controlling your bladder? Do you get dizzy when standing up or stretching? Have you had any eye or vision problems? Your doctor may want to do tests related to symptoms you have, too, especially for your nerves and heart. Blood and urine tests . These simple lab tests will sometimes show if there's too much protein in your body. Tissue biopsy . Your doctor may suggest a tissue biopsy if hATTR is suspected. They will take a little bit of tissue from your body, often a small piece of fat from your belly or side. This is quick and does not need a hospital stay. The doctor numbs the skin and then uses a needle to pull out some of the fat cells. Then a lab runs tests on these cells. A type of bone scan called scintigraphy may be done first, and if it detects amyloid deposits in the heart, a heart muscle biopsy may not be needed."", 'hATTR amyloidosis genetic testing If tests find amyloid, genetic testing will help figure out whether you have hereditary ATTR amyloidosis (hATTR) or non-hereditary, which is commonly called wild-type ATTR amyloidosis. Knowing which one you have is important because it affects treatment plans and prognosis. But tests cannot predict when symptoms will start, how serious they’ll be, or how soon the disease will get worse. You may want to get a second opinion once you’re diagnosed since hATTR is rare and not every doctor has experience with the disease.', 'Questions for Your Doctor Will my symptoms keep getting worse? What treatments are best for me now? Is there a clinical trial that I should think about? Do these treatments have side effects? What can I do about them? How do we check on my progress? Are there new symptoms I should watch for? How often should I see you? Should I add my name to a transplant or disease registry?', ""hATTR Amyloidosis Treatment Treatment of hATTR depends on your symptoms and how far your condition has developed. The goal of some treatment is to ease the symptoms that are caused when too much amyloid gathers in your organs. For instance, if you're having problems with your heart or kidneys, you may have a buildup of fluid in your body. Your doctor may prescribe a pill that helps you get rid of extra fluid. There are also medications you can take if you have digestive problems such as diarrhea or an early feeling of fullness. Researchers are also looking at the drugs anakinra and tocilizumab as possible treatments for hATTR. Treatment plan There are options to treat hATTR with polyneuropathy. The goal of these treatments is to lower the number of misfolded proteins. You can: Use gene silencer drugs . Some FDA-approved drugs act as a gene silencer. They stop the creation of TTR protein. They include: Inotersen. This drug is mostly used in stage I or II of hATTR. It is offered only through a specific, limited program because it can cause serious bleeding and kidney disease. You give yourself a shot from a prefilled syringe once a week. Patisiran. This drug is used in stage I or II. You get this in an 80-minute intravenous infusion at a clinic once every 3 weeks. Vutrisiran. It's an injection into the skin every 3 months to treat hATTR polyneuropathy."", ""Consider a liver transplant. Since TTR is made in the liver, a liver transplant may slow the disease, but it won't stop it. Transplants are sometimes recommended in the first stage of the disease in certain cases. If other organs are affected, such as the heart or kidney, other transplants may be considered. But transplants are costly and have a high risk of complications. The outcome of the transplant depends on a person’s age when symptoms start and the type of mutation. A liver transplant is major surgery. First, you'll need to get on a waiting list for a donor. Your new liver will come from someone who recently died and has the same blood type and a similar body size as yours. When donor livers are available, they go to the sickest people on the waiting list. You may need to stay in the hospital for up to 3 weeks after your surgery. It could take you 6 months to a year before you can return to your regular lifestyle. After your transplant, you'll need to take drugs that prevent your body from rejecting the new liver."", ""If you're considering a transplant, you'll need a lot of emotional support. Ask your doctor about support groups that have people facing the same concerns as you. Also ask about educational workshops that can explain what to expect before and after a transplant. What to do if your treatment isn’t working When approved treatments aren’t working, there are drugs that can help block the TTR gene. These drugs are considered “off-label” and are not officially approved for this particular use. Gene stabilizer drugs. These drugs prevent the TTR proteins from misfolding and forming amyloid deposits. They include: Tafamidis. This drug binds to the TTR gene. It is taken orally and slows down the disease in stages I-III. It also helps maintain quality of life. Tafamidis is approved to treat the cardiomyopathy of hATTR. Diflunisal. This is an NSAID (an anti-inflammatory). Studies of this drug show that it slowed disease progression and improved quality of life. It is taken orally twice a day. Doxycycline. This antibiotic may disrupt the amyloid fibrils (long strands of proteins that clump together) and may help relieve cardiac symptoms. More clinical trials need to be done to find out how effective it is."", 'Future or innovative treatments Researchers are looking into new treatments to find ways to suppress or stabilize the TTR gene. One of the drugs being researched is acoramidis. Clinical trials are looking at whether it works for both polyneuropathy and cardiac patients. In addition, clinical trials are using antibodies to remove amyloid deposits. Lastly, IONIS-TTR-LRx is a medicine in clinical trials to find out whether it reduces TTR production. Meet the care team (who treats this condition) Since hATTR with polyneuropathy impacts several organs and is a genetic disease, you’ll likely have to see several specialists to manage the disease. Your care team can include: Genetic counselor. This professional will help you understand how this disease affects you and your family. Genetic tests and counseling can help with early diagnosis of the disease. Neurologist. Neuropathy, or nerve pain and numbness, is one of the early signs of hATTR. A neurologist will use different tools to address the disease as it gets worse. Cardiologist. Some people with hATTR may have irregular heartbeats or other heart conditions. A cardiologist can guide you on how to reduce the cardiac symptoms. Nephrologist. Kidneys are often impacted by hATTR, and a nephrologist will assist in evaluating how well your kidneys work. Ophthalmologist. Some hATTR patients can have eye issues because of amyloid deposits. An ophthalmologist can help you with any impact on vision. Physical therapist. The physical therapist can help you with mobility issues and exercises that assist with walking.', 'How hATTR Progresses hATTR with polyneuropathy is a progressive disorder, meaning it gets worse over time. Different symptoms can come during the stages. These are the likely stages of the disease: Stage 0 In stage 0, hATTR with polyneuropathy generally has no symptoms. It is the stage where the TTR gene mutation is found through genetic testing. Stage I Mild symptoms appear in stage I. Those could include mild sensory, motor, and autonomic neuropathy in the lower limbs. Walking is generally not seriously affected. Stage II As the disease progresses, walking becomes more difficult and assistance may be required for movement. Your upper and lower limbs, as well as your trunk, are moderately affected. Stage III This involves serious motor, sensory, and autonomic involvement of all limbs. Most patients are bedridden and need the assistance of a wheelchair.', 'Disparities and hATTR Transplant surgery and medications for TTR blocking and stabilization are very expensive. People in lower socioeconomic groups may not be able to afford them. There are also issues of access as many of the treatments involved with hATTR use injectable medications, permission beforehand, specialist referrals, and shifts between medical and pharmacy benefits. Other baseline differences show up when considering race as a factor in hATTR. Black Americans have more heart failure complications from hATTR than White people. Some of the reasoning is related to societal factors related to access, health literacy, and poor access to care. But biological differences – such as how Black people respond to heart failure therapies, and a greater risk for high blood pressure and diabetes – also play a role in Black Americans and increased heart issues from hATTR.', 'hATTR Amyloidosis Complications Since hATTR amyloidosis affects several organs, the disease can lead to serious complications. Peripheral nervous system complications include carpal tunnel syndrome, trouble walking, and trouble with fine motor skills. You could be more sensitive to pain, and you may get weaker. hATTR patients will likely have autonomic problems that affect your internal organs. Among them are passing out from not enough blood getting to your brain (syncope), lower blood pressure, urinary tract infections that keep coming back, bladder issues, sexual dysfunction, and abnormal sweating. You can also have diarrhea and constipation. Irregular heartbeat and palpitations can happen and may need a pacemaker. Heart failure may need diuretic medicines to get extra fluid out of your body. And you may need medicine to raise your blood pressure if it becomes too low. Kidney failure, eye issues, and pain are also potential complications of hATTR.']"
64,Amyloidosis,"['Amyloidosis is when an abnormal protein called amyloid builds up in your tissues and organs. When it does, it affects their shape and how they work. Amyloidosis is a serious health problem that can lead to life-threatening organ failure.', 'Causes and Types of Amyloidosis Many different proteins can lead to amyloid deposits, but only a few have been linked to major health problems. The type of protein and where it collects tells the type of amyloidosis you have. Amyloid deposits may collect throughout your body or in just one area. The different types of amyloidosis include: AL amyloidosis (immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis). This is the most common type and used to be called primary amyloidosis. AL stands for “amyloid light chains,” which is the type of protein responsible for the condition. There’s no known cause, but it happens when your bone marrow makes abnormal antibodies that can’t be broken down. It’s linked with a blood cancer called multiple myeloma. It can affect your kidneys, heart, liver, intestines, and nerves.', ""AA amyloidosis. Previously known as secondary amyloidosis, this condition is the result of another chronic infectious or inflammatory disease such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn’s disease, or ulcerative colitis. It mostly affects your kidneys, but it can also affect your digestive tract, liver, and heart. AA means the amyloid type A protein causes this type. Dialysis-related amyloidosis (DRA). This is more common in older adults and people who have been on dialysis for more than 5 years. This form of amyloidosis is caused by deposits of beta-2 microglobulin that build up in the blood. Deposits can build up in many different tissues, but it most commonly affects bones, joints, and tendons. Familial, or hereditary, amyloidosis. This is a rare form passed down through families. It often affects the liver, nerves, heart, and kidneys. Many genetic defects are linked to a higher chance of amyloid disease. For example, an abnormal protein like transthyretin (TTR) is usually the cause. Age-related (senile) systemic amyloidosis. This is caused by deposits of normal TTR in the heart and other tissues. It happens most commonly in older men. Organ-specific amyloidosis. This causes deposits of amyloid protein in single organs, including the skin (cutaneous amyloidosis). Though some types of amyloid deposits have been linked to Alzheimer's disease, the brain is rarely affected by amyloidosis that happens throughout your body."", 'Risk Factors for Amyloidosis Men get amyloidosis more often than women. Your risk for amyloidosis goes up as you grow older. Amyloidosis affects 15% of patients with a form of cancer called multiple myeloma. Amyloidosis may also happen in people with end-stage kidney disease who are on dialysis for a long time (see ""Dialysis-related amyloidosis"" above).', 'Symptoms of Amyloidosis Symptoms of amyloidosis are often subtle. They can also vary greatly depending on where the amyloid protein is collecting in the body. It is important to note that the symptoms described below may be due to a variety of health problems. Only your doctor can make a diagnosis of amyloidosis. General symptoms of amyloidosis may include: Changes in skin color Severe fatigue Feeling of fullness Joint pain Low red blood cell count (anemia) Shortness of breath Swelling of the tongue Tingling and numbness in legs and feet Weak hand grip Severe weakness Sudden weight loss', 'Cardiac Amyloidosis (Stiff Heart Syndrome) This condition can cause less blood to flow to your heart muscle. Eventually, your heart will no longer be able to pump normally.', ""Some doctors also call cardiac amyloidosis “stiff heart syndrome.” Others say a stiff heart is actually a symptom of cardiac amyloidosis. Either way, amyloid deposits in your heart can make the muscular walls of your heart stiff. They can also make your heart muscle weaker and affect the electrical rhythm of the heart. Stiff heart syndrome can be serious. It may lead to congestive heart failure if it's not successfully treated. Who’s at risk? Cardiac amyloidosis is more common in men than in women. It’s also more likely to affect older people. People under 40 rarely get the condition. You can inherit stiff heart syndrome. Other things that raise your chances of getting it are: Having untreated high blood pressure Being obese Being over 60 Having gone through menopause What are the symptoms? If amyloidosis affects your heart, some symptoms you might notice are: Shortness of breath when you're doing light activity or lying down An irregular heartbeat Signs of heart failure, including swelling of the feet and ankles, weakness, fatigue, and nausea, among others"", ""These can be signs of other health conditions, too. So see your doctor to figure out what’s going on. How is it diagnosed? Your doctor will ask you about your symptoms and whether anyone in your family has cardiac amyloidosis or other heart conditions. They’ll give you a physical exam, too. The doctor may do several tests to diagnose or rule out cardiac amyloidosis, like: Blood and urine tests Imaging tests to see inside your body, like ultrasound, echocardiogram, electrocardiogram, MRI, or CT scan Biopsy Genetic testing, if cardiac amyloidosis runs in your family What are the treatments? There’s more than one type of cardiac amyloidosis. Your treatment will depend on the type you have. Among the options your doctor might recommend are: Medications, including chemotherapy and immunotherapy A pacemaker A stem cell transplant While some of these treatments, like chemo and immunotherapy, are also used to treat cancer, cardiac amyloidosis isn't cancer. It's a disease that affects the heart muscle. There's no cure, but there are treatments for most types of cardiac amyloidosis. Getting an early diagnosis is important since treatment can prevent permanent damage."", 'Renal (Kidney) Amyloidosis Your kidneys filter waste and toxins from your blood. Amyloid deposits in the kidneys make it hard for them to do this job. When your kidneys do not work properly, water and dangerous toxins build up in your body. If amyloidosis affects the kidneys, you may have: Signs of kidney failure, including swelling of the feet and ankles and puffiness around the eyes High levels of protein in your urine', 'Gastrointestinal Amyloidosis Amyloid deposits along your gastrointestinal (GI) tract slow down the movement of food through your intestines. This interferes with digestion. If amyloidosis affects your GI tract, you may have: Less appetite Diarrhea Nausea Stomach pain Weight loss If your liver is affected, that can cause liver enlargement and fluid buildup in the body.', ""Amyloid Neuropathy Amyloid deposits can damage the nerves outside your brain and spinal cord, called the peripheral nerves. The peripheral nerves carry information between your brain and spinal cord and the rest of your body. For example, they make your brain perceive pain if you burn your hand or stub your toes. If amyloidosis affects your nerves, you may have: Balance problems Problems controlling your bladder and bowel Sweating problems Tingling and weakness Lightheadedness when standing due to a problem with your body's ability to control blood pressure"", ""Diagnosing Amyloidosis A thorough physical exam and a detailed and accurate account of your medical history are crucial in helping your doctor diagnose amyloidosis. Blood and urine tests can spot abnormal proteins. Depending on your symptoms, your doctor may also check your thyroid and liver. Your doctor will do a biopsy to confirm a diagnosis of amyloidosis and know the specific type of protein you have. The tissue sample for the biopsy may be taken from your belly fat (the abdominal fat pad), bone marrow, or sometimes your mouth, rectum, or other organs. It's not always necessary to biopsy the part of the body damaged by the amyloid deposits. Imaging tests can also help. They show the amount of damage to organs like your heart, liver, or spleen. Your doctor will do a genetic test if they think you have a type that is passed down through families. Treatment for hereditary amyloidosis is different from treatment for other types of the disease. Once you’re diagnosed, your doctor might check your heart with an echocardiogram or your liver and spleen with imaging tests."", 'Amyloidosis Treatment There is no cure for amyloidosis. Your doctor will prescribe treatments to slow the development of the amyloid protein and manage your symptoms. If amyloidosis is related to another condition, then treatment will include targeting that underlying condition. Specific treatment depends on what type of amyloidosis you have and how many organs are affected. High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant can help remove the substance that leads to amyloid formation in some people with primary AL amyloidosis. Chemotherapy medicines alone may be used to treat other patients with primary AL amyloidosis. Secondary (AA) amyloidosis is treated by controlling the underlying disorder and with powerful anti-inflammatory medicines called steroids, which fight inflammation. A liver transplant may treat\xa0the disease if you have certain types of hereditary amyloidosis. New therapies can slow the production of the abnormal protein TTR. Your doctor might also recommend a kidney transplant. Other treatments to help with symptoms include: Diuretic medicine to remove extra water from your body Thickeners to add to fluids to prevent choking if you have trouble swallowing Compression stockings to relieve swelling in your legs or feet Changes to what you eat, especially if you have gastrointestinal amyloidosis', 'What to Expect Amyloidosis can be deadly, especially if it affects your heart or kidneys. Early diagnosis and treatment are important and can help improve survival. Researchers continue to question why some types of amyloid make people sick and how the formation of amyloid can be stopped. Studies to find new treatments are ongoing. If you have amyloidosis, consider asking your doctor if there are any clinical trials you can join, or search for one by visiting www.clinicaltrials.gov and typing in the search term ""amyloidosis.""']"
65,What Is Transverse Myelitis?,"[""Transverse myelitis (TM) is an inflammation of your spinal cord. It results from damage to nerve cells in your spinal cord. Myelin is a fatty tissue that protects these nerve fibers. It fits around them like the insulation that covers an electrical wire. Inflammation of your spinal cord causes transverse myelitis, a rare condition that can cause back pain, bladder and bowel control issues, and even loss of control of your legs. (Photo Credit: iStock/Getty Images) When myelin is damaged, the nerves under it can be hurt, too. Once your nerves are scarred, it’s harder for them to send signals to other parts of your body the way they should. This often brings pain , weakness, or paralysis . When this happens to the nerves on both sides of a segment of your spinal cord, it's known as transverse myelitis. It might take months to years to recover from this condition, leaving minor problems for some people. But it also might cause serious and permanent problems affecting your ability to do simple, everyday tasks. TM is rare, resulting in about 1,400 new cases a year in the U.S. Transverse myelitis can happen at any age but often occurs in people aged 10-19 years and 30-39 years. People assigned female at birth are at a higher risk of this condition."", 'Multiple sclerosis vs. transverse myelitis Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a condition that affects the brain and spinal cord. It occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks myelin in the brain, spinal cord, and eye nerves. Rarely, it can cause TM. When it does, symptoms usually appear on one side of the body. These symptoms can be the first ones that a person with MS shows. They may also happen as a sign of an MS relapse.', ""Idiopathic Transverse Myelitis For the majority of people with TM, there's no known cause, and that's called idiopathic transverse myelitis. There may be an abnormal immune response against your spinal cord that causes the inflammation and damage associated with TM. But so far researchers haven't been able to find what triggers it."", ""Transverse Myelitis Causes It's not clear what exactly causes TM. But scientists know it can happen when your immune system attacks healthy cells for some reason or when your body tries to fight off a disease, such as a viral, bacterial, or fungal infection. Mostly, it starts after you’ve recovered from an illness."", ""Your immune system releases inflammatory cells in response to an invading agent during an infection. Sometimes, the immune system releases inflammatory cells for no reason or sends out too many, leading to serious damage to the body. TM occurs when your spinal cord's nerve cells are damaged. TM is often linked to: Autoimmune conditions Autoimmune conditions occur when the immune system works abnormally and attacks healthy cells, tissues, and organs. They include lupus , ankylosing spondylitis, antiphospholipid syndrome, Behçet’s disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and Sjogren's syndrome, all tied to TM. Infections Bacterial infections such as Lyme disease , tuberculosis , and syphilis Fungal infections of the spinal cord, such as those caused by aspergillus, blastomyces, candida, coccidioides, and cryptococcus Parasitic infections such as toxoplasmosis, cysticercosis , schistosomiasis, and strongyloidiasis Viral infections such as those caused by varicella-zoster (which causes chickenpox and shingles), enterovirus, Zika virus, and West Nile virus Multiple sclerosis (MS) In rare cases, multiple sclerosis can cause transverse myelitis.

The first symptoms of TM are usually: Pain in your back Sharp pain that moves down your legs and arms or around your chest and belly Weakness or paralysis in your legs or arms Sensitivity to touch, to the point where slight fingertip pressure causes pain Numbness or a pins-and-needles feeling in your toes, feet , or legs Muscle spasms Fever Loss of appetite Bladder and bowel control issues, such as an increased urge to use the toilet, constipation, or incontinence Sexual dysfunction Headache Loss of appetite Depression Anxiety Breathing problems', 'Once they start, symptoms can get worse within hours. Most of the time, they peak within 10 days. At that point, about half the people who get TM lose control of their legs. How much of your body is affected depends on which part of your spinal cord has the problem. The higher it is, the more problems you’ll have. Abnormal sensations caused by transverse myelitis TM can cause abnormal sensations in the legs, back, belly, and arms that feel numb, tingle, burn, tickle, or prick. You might also have sensory loss altogether.', 'Transverse Myelitis Diagnosis Your doctor will run tests to find out if you have TM or other conditions. MRI or CT scans These tests create\xa0detailed images of your insides. They’ll show the doctor if something else is affecting your nerves, such as a tumor, slipped disk, or narrowing of the channel that holds your spinal cord. An MRI can show demyelination, a sign of MS.', 'Spinal tap For this test, your doctor puts a needle between two vertebrae (bones in your back) to take a sample of the fluid surrounding your brain and spinal cord. You might have an infection if it has more disease-fighting white blood cells or certain proteins than it should. That may be a sign of TM. Blood work Your doctor will test your blood for signs of illnesses with similar symptoms, such as lupus , HIV , or another form of myelitis.', ""Transverse Myelitis Treatment There's no cure for TM, so your doctor will try to manage the disease and ease your symptoms.

66,Concussions: Symptoms and Treatment,"['What Is a Concussion? The most common and least serious type of traumatic brain injury is called a concussion. The word comes from the Latin word concutere , which means ""to shake violently."" A concussion is most often caused by a sudden direct blow or bump to the head. According to the CDC, between 2001 and 2009, an estimated 173,285 people under age 19 were treated in hospital emergency rooms for concussions related to sports and recreation activities. Other causes include car and bicycle accidents, work-related injuries, falls, and fighting. A concussion is a brain injury often caused by a blow such as a fall or collision in sports. Photo Credit: Living Art Enterprises / Science Source', ""Concussion Causes The brain is made of soft tissue. It's cushioned by spinal fluid and encased in the protective shell of the skull. When you have a blow or bump to your head, the impact can jolt your brain . Sometimes, it literally causes it to move around in your head. Traumatic brain injuries can cause bruising, damage to the blood vessels, and injury to the nerves. The result is your brain doesn't function as it should. If you've had a concussion, vision may be disturbed, you may lose equilibrium, or you may fall unconscious. In short, the brain is confused."", ""Some things increase your risk for a concussion, including: Falls, particularly in children and older adults Playing a contact sport Lack of proper safety gear or supervision for contact sports Car, motorcycle, bicycle, and other accidents that cause a blow to the head Being hit, struck with an object, or other physical abuse Military service An earlier concussion Other than direct blows to the head, concussions can be caused by foreign objects. You can be struck by something such as during a sports game or get whiplash injuries or blast zone injuries in a war zone. Sports concussion In both contact and noncontact sports, athletes are at risk for concussions. This is true whether you're playing Little League or in the pros. The symptoms for a sports concussion are the same as any other type of concussion. But putting an athlete back in the game too soon could be dangerous and lead to a higher chance of another concussion. If you get a second concussion, it may make it much harder to heal and you could have long-term effects such as chronic headaches or learning difficulties. Get cleared by a doctor before you return to sports."", ""Concussion Symptoms Concussions can be tricky to diagnose. Though you may have a visible cut or bruise on your head, you can't see a concussion. Signs of a concussion may not appear for days or weeks after the injury. Some symptoms last for just seconds; others may linger. Concussions are fairly common. Some estimates say a mild brain trauma is sustained every 21 seconds in the U.S. But it's important to recognize the signs of a concussion so you can take the proper steps to treat the injury. There are some common physical, mental, and emotional symptoms a person may display following a concussion. Signs of traumatic brain injury include: Confusion or feeling dazed Clumsiness Slurred speech Nausea or vomiting Headache Balance problems or dizziness Blurred vision Sensitivity to light Sensitivity to noise Sluggishness Ringing in ears Irritability or other behavior or personality changes Difficulty concentrating Loss of memory Fatigue or sleepiness Loss of consciousness Forgetfulness such as repeating yourself Slowed response to questions Problems with sleep Depression Problems with taste or smell"", ""Concussions in Children Because their heads are \xa0large compared to the rest of their body, \xa0young children get concussions fairly often. As kids enter adolescence, they have rapid height and weight gain. Both these things make them more prone to accidents than adults. If a child has concussion symptoms, an adult should monitor them for the first 24 hours. Don’t give medications , including ibuprofen or aspirin , which may cause bleeding, to a child without talking to a doctor first. It's important to watch closely for behavioral changes or other signs of a concussion. Young children, especially, may not be able to fully communicate what they’re feeling. Symptoms of concussions in children include: Headache Dizziness Problems with balance Upset stomach or vomiting Fatigue Sensitivity to light or noise Mental fogginess or slowed thinking Problems with memory, concentration, or focus Feeling more irritable, sad, nervous, or emotional than usual Problems with sleep"", ""Concussions in Babies The signs of a concussion in a baby or toddler may be harder to spot because they won't be able to tell you what is happening. So you'll have to be extra vigilant. Concussion symptoms in toddlers and babies are similar to those in children. But also watch out for: Changes in sleeping or eating patterns Not showing interest in their favorite toys Unsteadiness Staring blankly If they are able to speak, their words are slurred Loss of consciousness Particularly in babies, crying without being able to be consoled Also in babies, not nursing or eating Extreme emotions Confusion or distraction Not being able to preform new skills, such as toilet training Large bruises or head bumps in places other than the forehead"", 'Concussion Diagnosis Most people with concussions fully recover with appropriate treatment. But because a concussion can be serious, safeguarding yourself is important. Seek medical attention . A health care professional can decide how serious the concussion is and whether you require treatment.', 'They’ll ask how the head injury happened and discuss the symptoms. The doctor may also ask you simple questions such as ""Where do you live?,"" ""What is your name?,"" or ""Who is the president?"" The doctor asks these questions to evaluate memory and concentration skills. The doctor may test coordination and reflexes, which are both functions of the central nervous system . They may also order a CT scan or an MRI to rule out bleeding or other serious brain injury. Emergency symptoms of a concussion include: Weakness in the arms or legs Being very pale for more than an hour Changes in behavior Becoming easily confused, such as not being able to recognize places or people Slurred speech Problems with mental function Stumbling or clumsiness Vomiting or nausea Dilated pupils Ringing in the ears that doesn\'t go away Seizures or convulsions Dizziness that won\'t go away No improvement in your condition Being unconscious for longer than 30 seconds Worsening headache Fluid or blood draining from the nose or ears', ""Concussion Treatment If you don’t need hospitalization, the doctor will give you instructions to follow.\xa0Concussions very rarely require an overnight stay in the hospital, and typically you can return home to rest and recover. Experts recommend follow-up medical attention within 24 to 72 hours if symptoms worsen. To recover at home, you should: Take a break. If your concussion was sustained during athletic activity, stop play and sit it out. Your brain needs time to properly heal, so rest is key. Definitely do not resume play the same day. Coaches should closely monitor athletes and children upon resuming play. If you resume play too soon, you risk a greater chance of having a second concussion, which can compound the damage. The American Academy of Neurology has issued guidelines about resuming activities after a concussion. For the first 2 days after your injury, you should take plenty of time to relax and avoid anything too straining on your brain such as heavy loads of work, loud noises, and bright lights. You can gradually increase physical and mental activities as your symptoms improve. Guard against repeat concussions. Repeat concussions cause cumulative effects on the brain. They can have devastating consequences, including brain swelling , permanent brain damage , long-term disabilities, or even death. Don't return to normal activities if you still have symptoms. Get a doctor's clearance so you can return to work or play with confidence. Treat pain with aspirin-free medications. Your doctor will prescribe a medication to relieve pain or recommend an over-the-counter option. Avoid anything that will thin the blood such as ibuprofen, and stick to acetaminophen."", ""Concussion self-care It's important to give yourself the time to properly heal from a concussion. Don't push yourself. It's normal to need more sleep than you typically do, but that doesn't mean you should stop all activities. Recognize what triggers your symptoms. Maybe it's watching TV or texting, and try to avoid those things until you're feeling better. In the meantime, drink plenty of water and avoid alcohol."", ""Concussion Recovery There are three phases of concussion recovery: Phase one: Acute symptomatic phase. This is the time from injury until symptoms begin to clear up. This phase usually lasts less than 3 days. During this phase, if you have any of the emergency symptoms mentioned above, get medical help right away. The most important thing during this phase is rest. Stay hydrated and eat as you normally would. Phase two: Recovery. By this phase your symptoms should be improving. You can gradually start to increase your physical and mental activities, but if they trigger you, take a break. Your doctor will tell you on when it's safe to return to sports. You may need accommodations at school or work. Phase three: Recovered phase. Full recovery for those under 18 is normally considered 30 days, and for those over 18 is 14 days. But the severity of your symptoms play a role in how quickly you'll be back to yourself. Milestones include being able to return to school or work and getting back to physical activity."", ""Concussion Complications Post-concussive syndrome is when issues from a concussion linger after you should have recovered. These symptoms can include trouble concentrating, problems with memory, headaches, changes in personality, mood swings, dizziness, fatigue, and insomnia for weeks to months. Delayed concussion symptoms, in which you don't have symptoms until several days or weeks after the event, can play a role in this as well. If this happens to you, it's extra important to avoid activities that put you at risk of another concussion. By following concussion protocol -- the set of rules and guidelines for caring for those with brain injuries -- your doctor may suggest small increases in activity and a gradual return to your normal activities. Concussion protocol for kids may call for shorter school days and fewer assignments."", ""Concussion Prevention A concussion is unexpected, so it is tough to prevent. But there are several commonsense precautions you can take to lessen the possibility of traumatic brain injury. Wear protective equipment. Playing high-contact, high-risk sports such as football, hockey, boxing, and rugby increases the odds of a concussion. Skateboarding, snowboarding, horseback riding, and inline skating are also a threat to your brain's health. Wearing headgear, padding, and mouth and eye guards can help safeguard against traumatic head injuries. Wearing a bike helmet can lower the risk of traumatic head injury by 85%. There's also a new collar-like device called\xa0Q-Collar that can be worn by athletes. It applies compression to the neck and increases blood volume to help reduce brain movement due to hits to the head. Make sure any equipment fits you correctly and is well-maintained. Drive and ride smart. Always wear a seatbelt, obey speed limits, and don't use drugs or alcohol because they can impair reaction time. Don't fight. Fighting is a common cause of concussions. Reduce trip and fall hazards in your home. Clear clutter from floors and hallways, and make sure your home is well-lighted. Exercise regularly. It can give you stronger leg muscles and better balance, which can prevent falls. Use home safety measures to protect your children. Install window guards and block stairways."", 'Takeaways A concussion is the least serious type of injury to the brain. Any kind of blow or jolt to the head, such as a fall or sports injury, can cause a concussion. In certain cases, such as if you lose consciousness for more than 30 seconds, are continuously vomiting, \xa0or have a worsening headache, this could be an emergency and you should go to a doctor right away. The best way to recover from a concussion is rest and slowly getting back to your routine.', 'Concussion FAQs What are five signs of a concussion? Some signs of a concussion include nausea, feeling confused, clumsiness, slurred speech, and headache. What are the early signs of concussion? Early signs of a concussion include double or blurry vision, forgetfulness, and sensitivity to light. How long will a mild concussion last? Symptoms tend to improve within 3 days, but for a full recovery it will typically take about 30 days for those under 18 and 14 days for those over 18.']"
67,Summer Travel Health Advice,"['SARS. Lyme disease . West Nile virus . With the smorgasbord of exotic bugs seemingly waiting to get us, is it safe to travel this summer? The answer is a resounding yes, say travel health experts. With proper planning and precautions, the 7 in 10 Americans hitting the roads and skies this summer can help ensure a healthy vacation for their families. Here is some travel health advice, straight from the experts.', 'Be Proactive ""Think about health in advance of your trip,"" advises Bradley Connor, MD, a travel health specialist at Weill Medical College of Cornell University and president of the International Society of Travel Medicine (ISTM). ""If you have a chronic health problem, get a checkup before you leave,"" he says. And find out as much as you can in advance about destination-specific health risks. The ISTM as well as the CDC and the World Health Organization (WHO) offer up-to-date information.', 'Pack a Travel Health Kit Expect the unexpected, warns Connor. He tells all his patients to pack a travel health kit, equipped with the following:', ""An anti-inflammatory drug such as ibuprofen or naproxen Anti- diarrhea medication such as Imodium , available over-the-counter Motion sickness medication -- also available over-the-counter Band-Aids Antiseptic cream Drugs for stomach upset If you wear glasses, pack a spare pair. Mosquito or other bug repellents may also be advisable. And if you take any prescription drugs , be sure to bring along enough for the entire trip, he says. If you're flying, always place the medication in your carry-on luggage in case your baggage is lost."", 'A Shot in the Arm About 30 million Americans go abroad each year, some 8 million of whom visit developing countries where the risk of tropical and infectious diseases is high, notes Connor. And many of them fail to follow basic travel health advice. ""The good news is most of these diseases are preventable, but the bad news is most people fail to take steps to protect themselves."" He should know. Connor is co-author of a new survey showing that 4 in 10 Americans traveling to areas with high rates of malaria fail to carry antimalarial drugs. And although the majority of travelers said they believe vaccines are effective for prevention, only 1 in 3 was immunized against tetanus , fewer than 3 in 10 had received hepatitis A shots, and just 1 in 10 was vaccinated against yellow fever . ""Ensure you have all the right vaccinations and medications before you leave,"" he says.', 'Consider a Flu Shot Flu shots are now recommended for all people traveling to developing nations, in a group, or on a cruise, says David O. Freedman, MD, travel health specialist at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. In addition to warding off the aches and misery of influenza, a flu shot may also help avoid an unnecessary scare -- or being pulled over by immigration officials who suspect you have SARS, he says. ""The symptoms of influenza and SARS are very similar,"" Freedman notes. ""Until we have a good mechanism in place to rapidly identify SARS, the only sensible approach is to cast a wide net. If people have symptoms that mimic those of SARS, they will need to be isolated until we can clear them.""', 'Wash Your Hands -- Again, and Again, and Again ""If there is one message we want to say over and over, it is, "" Wash your hands ,"" says Isabelle Nuttall, MD, an infectious disease specialist at WHO headquarters in Geneva. Good hygiene is the first line of defense against any viral or bacterial ailment, be it the common cold or the potentially deadly severe acute respiratory syndrome.', ""Following the correct technique is important, the experts say. If you're in a public restroom with a towel dispenser, first pull down the paper so you have a clean sheet waiting with which to dry off. Then run the hot water and vigorously scrub for at least 15 seconds, making sure to get all the nooks and crannies -- the folds of your hands as well as cuticles and fingernails that can trap dirt and germs. If the washbasin has foot pedal, be sure to use it."", 'A simple trick, they add, is to say the alphabet to yourself while washing -- by the time you reach the letter ""Z,"" your 15 seconds will have elapsed. If the washroom has an electric hand-dryer rather than a paper dispenser, use your elbow to turn it on. When should you wash? Before you prepare or eat food; treat a cut or wound; tend to someone who is sick, or insert or remove contact lenses . And, of course, you should wash after you go to the bathroom; handle uncooked foods, particularly raw meat, poultry or fish; change a diaper; blow your nose, cough or sneeze; handle garbage; tend to someone who is sick or injured, or handle an animal or animal waste.', 'Drink and Eat Sensibly Travelers\' diarrhea throws a wrench into more vacations than any other disease, striking an estimated 10 million travelers each year, says David Shlim, MD, medical director of Jackson Hole Travel and Tropical Medicine in Wyoming. High-risk destinations: Mexico, Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. To minimize risk, follow this standard travel health advice: Drink only bottled or boiled water. Eat well cooked, rather than raw or undercooked meat and seafood. Avoid any foods or beverages purchased from street vendors or establishments with unhygienic conditions. Avoid eating raw fruits and vegetables unless you peel them yourself. Don\'t put ice in your drinks. But no matter how closely you follow this advice, you may still come down with travelers\' diarrhea, says Shlim, who believes restaurant food preparation is the culprit. ""Some restaurants may use the same cutting board for raw vegetables and meat, for example. Or they may rinse vegetables in dirty tap water."" His advice: Eat only freshly served foods that were cooked at high heat. ""Lasagna and casseroles are risky because they are often cooked earlier, leaving plenty of time for organisms to grow.""', 'Shlim also advises going to a doctor in advance of your trip and asking him or her for a course of antibiotics . Taken as soon as diarrhea strikes, the drugs can usually shorten the illness from several days to several hours.', 'Move Around, Drink Plenty of Fluids Sitting in a cramped position for long periods -- whether in an airplane, car, or a bus -- can lead to an increased risk of potentially deadly blood clots , warns Wolfgang Schobersberger, MD, professor of intensive care medicine at the University of Innsbruck in Austria. To minimize risk, drink plenty of non- alcoholic fluids and frequently move your legs, he says. Taking frequent, deep breaths can also improve circulation. Those at moderate risk should also wear compression stockings , sometimes called support hose, he says. And those at high risk should ask their doctor about an injection of heparin immediately before the trip, which will provide protection for about 12 hours, he says. Your risk for blood clots increases if you are age 60 or older, have heart disease, a family history of blood clots, varicose veins , obesity, cancer , are pregnant or recently had a baby, or have had recent surgery.', ""Don't Get Bitten Mosquitoes are not just pesky pests: They can carry West Nile disease, dengue fever , even malaria. Ticks spread Lyme disease . But a few simple precautions can minimize your risk of getting bitten this summer, the experts say. Among their travel health advice: Stay indoors at dawn and dusk and in the evening, when mosquitoes are most active. Wear long-sleeved shirts, long pants, and hats. Shirts should be tucked in. Tuck your pants into your socks and wear boots, not sandals. Inspect yourself and your clothing for ticks, both during outdoor activity and at the end of the day. Prompt removal of attached ticks can prevent some infections. Consider using an insect repellent: Most experts recommend repellents containing DEET on skin and permethrin -containing repellents on clothing, shoes, bed nets, and camping gear. But these ingredients can be toxic, so be sure to follow the instructions carefully."", 'Leave Fear -- and Masks -- at Home Do not let fear of SARS ruin your summer vacation, Freedman says.', 'And even though designer masks are popping up in some airports, Freedman advises against them. ""They probably don\'t do a whole lot of good and may even facilitate the spread of germs,"" he says. Typically, masks bought in stories do not have a tight fit, he explains. Plus, they get easily soiled, so you may inadvertently spread germs when taking them off. Finally, the pore size is insufficient to catch viruses or bacteria, Freedman says. ""SARS may dominate the headlines, but there\'s no reason it should dominate your trip."" Published May 22, 2003.']"
68,Traveler's Diarrhea,"[""Traveler's diarrhea is\xa0an intestinal infection that occurs as a result of eating or drinking contaminated food or water. Food handlers who do not wash their hands after they use the bathroom can transmit the infection to people who consume the contaminated food. Areas where there is the highest risk of contracting traveler's diarrhea include the developing countries of Africa, the Middle East, Latin America, and Asia. The risk of infection varies depending on the type of exposure -- from a fairly low risk from eating hot, cooked foods and drinking factory-sealed beverages to a higher risk from eating raw vegetables and fruits and drinking tap water. The most common culprit is a bacteria called E.coli ."", ""What Are the Symptoms of Traveler's Diarrhea? The typical symptoms of traveler's diarrhea include: Abrupt onset of diarrhea Fever Nausea and vomiting Bloating Urgent need to have a bowel movement Malaise (weakness or discomfort) Explosive and painful gas Stomach c ramps Loss of appetite Traveler's diarrhea usually lasts from 3 to 7 days and is rarely life threatening."", ""How Do I Treat Traveler's Diarrhea? As with all diseases, it is best to consult a doctor rather than attempting to self-medicate for traveler's diarrhea. This is especially relevant for pregnant women and children. Pepto-Bismol (2 ounces four times daily or two tablets four times daily) decreases the diarrhea and shortens the duration of the illness. This medication also appears to be effective in preventing traveler's diarrhea, but it should not be taken for more than three weeks at a time. Side effects of Pepto-Bismol can include temporary blackening of tongue and stools, occasional nausea, constipation , and rarely, ringing in the ears . Do not take Pepto-Bismol if you have an aspirin allergy, renal insufficiency, gout , or if you are taking anticoagulants, probenecid ( Benemid , Probalan ), or methotrexate ( Rheumatrex ). The most important treatment\xa0requires the replacement of fluids and salts lost from diarrhea. This is best achieved by use of an oral rehydration solution such as the World Health Organization oral rehydration salts (ORS) solution. ORS packets are available at stores or pharmacies in almost all developing countries."", ""ORS is prepared by adding one packet to boiled or treated water. Packet instructions should be followed carefully to ensure that the salts are added to the correct volume of water. ORS solution should be consumed or discarded within 12 hours if stored at room temperature or within 24 hours if refrigerated. An antidiarrheal medication, such as Lomotil or Imodium , can decrease the number of diarrheal stools but can also cause complications for people with serious infections. These drugs should not be used by anyone with a high fever or blood in their stools. Antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin ( Cipro ), norfloxacin ( Noroxin ), rifamycin (Aemcolo),\xa0and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim ( Bactrim , Septra ), may shorten the length of illness. The CDC does not recommend the use of\xa0 most antibiotics to prevent traveler's diarrhea, with the exception of rifaximin (Xifaxan) ,\xa0because they can sometimes cause additional problems. Azithromycin (Zithromax) is typically used to treat traveler's diarrhea. Consult your doctor about taking these medications . It is important for an infected person to consult a doctor about treating diarrhea in children and infants, because some of the drugs mentioned above are not recommended for children. The greatest risk for children, especially infants, is dehydration . Again, the best treatment for dehydration is the ORS solution. Breastfed infants should continue nursing on demand. For bottle-fed infants, full-strength lactose-free or lactose-reduced formulas should be used. Be sure to mix the formula with boiled water that has cooled. Older children receiving semisolid or solid foods should continue to receive usual foods if they have diarrhea. Immediate medical attention is required if an infant with diarrhea develops signs of moderate to severe dehydration (including dry mouth , eyes , and skin ),\xa0confusion; sunken eyes ; and fever, bloody diarrhea, persistent vomiting , or fever higher than 102 F."", ""When Should I Call the Doctor About Traveler's Diarrhea? Seek medical help for traveler's diarrhea if: Diarrhea is severe, bloody, or does not resolve within a few days Diarrhea is accompanied by fever and chills You are unable to keep fluids down to prevent dehydration"", ""How Can I Protect Myself From Traveler's Diarrhea? In areas with poor sanitation, only the following beverages may be safe to drink: boiled water, hot beverages (such as coffee or tea) made with boiled water, canned or bottled carbonated beverages, beer, and wine. Avoid ice, as it may have been made from contaminated water. It is safer to drink from an unopened can or bottle than from a container that is not known to be clean and dry. Water on the surface of a beverage can or bottle may also be contaminated. Therefore, the area of a can or bottle that will touch the mouth should be wiped clean and dried. Where water may be contaminated, you should not brush your teeth with tap water."", ""How Can I Make Water Safe to Drink? Boiling is the most reliable method to make water safe to drink. Bring water to a vigorous boil, then allow it to cool; do not add ice. At high altitudes, allow water to boil vigorously for a few minutes or use chemical disinfectants. Chemical disinfection can be achieved with either iodine or chlorine. Iodine usually provides greater disinfection. For disinfection with iodine, use either tincture of iodine or tetraglycine hydroperiodide tablets, such as Globaline or Potable-Aqua. These disinfectants can be found in sporting goods stores and pharmacies. Read and follow the manufacturer's instructions. If the water is cloudy, strain it through a clean cloth and double the number of disinfectant tablets added. If the water is very cold, either warm it or allow increased time for the disinfectant to work. Adding a pinch of salt or pouring water from one container to another will improve the taste. Portable water filters are not recommended due to lack of independently verified results of the filters' effectiveness. As a last resort, if no source of safe drinking water is available, tap water that is uncomfortably hot to the touch may be safer than cold tap water. However, many disease-causing organisms can survive the usual temperature reached by the hot water in overseas hotels and boiling or proper disinfection is still advised."", 'What Precautions Should I Take With Food? Food should be selected with care. Foods you should avoid include: Salads Uncooked vegetables and fruit. If you peel fruit yourself, it is generally safe. Unpasteurized milk and dairy products Raw meat and shellfish Food that has been cooked and is still hot is usually safe. Some fish is not guaranteed to be safe, even when cooked, because of the presence of toxins in their flesh. Tropical reef fish, red snapper, amberjack, grouper, and sea bass can occasionally be toxic at unpredictable times if they are caught on tropical reefs rather than in the open ocean. The barracuda and puffer fish are often toxic and should generally not be eaten. Seafood from the islands of the West Indies and the tropical Pacific and Indian Oceans should be avoided, as it is more likely to contain toxins.']"
69,The Brain and Essential Tremor,"['Essential tremor is a nerve disorder that causes shaking that you can’t control in different parts and on different sides of your body. It often affects areas like your hands, arms, head, larynx (voice box), tongue , and chin. The lower body is rarely involved. ET is not life-threatening unless it keeps someone from caring for themselves. Most people are able to live regular lives with this condition, although they may find it hard to do everyday things like eating, dressing, or writing. It’s only when the tremors become severe that they actually cause disability.', 'What Causes Essential Tremor? Doctors don’t understand the true cause of essential tremor, but it’s thought that the unusual electrical brain activity that causes it is processed through the thalamus. The thalamus is a structure deep in the brain that coordinates and controls muscle activity. Genes cause ET in half of all people with the condition. Someone who has ET will have up to a 50% chance of passing down the responsible gene to their child, but the child may never have symptoms. Although ET is more common in older people -- and symptoms become more serious with age -- it is not a part of the natural aging process.', 'Who Gets Essential Tremor? Essential tremor is the most common movement disorder, affecting up to 10 million people in the U.S. ET can happen at any age, but it most often appears during adolescence or in middle age (between ages 40 and 50).', ""What Are the Symptoms of Essential Tremor? The main symptoms of essential tremor include: Shaking for brief periods of time that you can’t control Shaking voice Nodding head Tremors that get worse during emotional stress Tremors that get worse when you move on purpose Tremors that lessen with rest Balance problems (in rare cases) Many other factors or diseases can also cause tremors, including Parkinson's disease , multiple sclerosis , fatigue after exercise , extreme emotional distress, brain tumors , some prescription drugs , metabolic problems, and alcohol or drug withdrawal."", ""Can Essential Tremor Increase the Risk for Other Illnesses? Essential tremor is linked to other illnesses. Other movement disorders, such as Parkinson's disease , have been associated with ET. Some reports have linked ET with migraine headaches . People with ET may also be at high risk of having dementia (particularly Alzheimer’s disease)."", ""Drugs that treat essential tremor may also make you more likely to become depressed. Some experts think there’s no increased risk for Parkinson's disease for people with ET. Instead, some people diagnosed with ET may be incorrectly diagnosed at first and later turn out to have Parkinson's."", 'How Is Essential Tremor Diagnosed? A neurologist or movement disorder specialist can usually diagnose essential tremor based on your symptoms and a complete neurological exam. There is no specific blood , urine, or other test used to diagnose ET. As part of the exam, your doctor may consider other causes of tremor, such as thyroid disease, too much caffeine , or medication side effects.', 'How Is Essential Tremor Treated? Mild essential tremor may not need treatment. But if ET causes problems in your everyday life or if you find it socially unacceptable, treatments may improve symptoms. These can include medications or surgery. Medications. Drugs that you take by mouth can make essential tremor less severe. They include gabapentin ( Neurontin ), primidone ( Mysoline ), propranolol ( Hemangeol , Inderal , Inderal XL , InnoPran XL ), and topiramate ( Topamax ). Other drug options include the benzodiazepines alprazolam ( Xanax ), clonazepam ( Klonopin ), diazepam ( Valium ), and lorazepam ( Ativan ). Botox shots may also be a treatment option. This treatment has been effective for vocal and head tremors. Adaptive devices. These are external devices that can help change or control how severe your tremors are. They may help anyone with ET, but people who have disabling tremors are generally not considered good candidates. The devices include neuromodulation devices that you wear and control yourself, and tremor cancellation devices that control hand tremors, allowing you to eat or write. Deep brain stimulation (DBS). People who have severe tremor despite medical therapy can get help from this surgical treatment. Your doctor implants an electrode in your thalamus and attaches it to a pacemaker-type device under the skin of your chest. The device causes tiny, painless shocks that disrupt faulty electrical messages in the brain. DBS offers moderate relief in about 90% of people who get it. It doesn’t destroy brain tissue, and it can be removed or adjusted. But you need brain surgery to put it in place, and some people have symptoms when it delivers a shock. MRI-guided focused high-intensity ultrasound . This uses magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to focus ultrasound to destroy tissue in the thalamus. The procedure is painless, with no cutting or drilling into the brain. You don’t need anesthesia, and you’re awake and responsive the whole time. But it doesn’t work for everyone, and any improvement in your tremors can fade over time. Thalamotomy. Less often, someone with ET may have surgery to destroy part of the thalamus. It’s usually done on only one side of your brain, to lower the risk of complications. Tremors will get better on the opposite side of your body. Biomechanical loading. External force is applied to a limb or muscle to control the tremor. Studies show that a repeat of this therapy can ease tremors.', 'Can Essential Tremor Be Prevented? Because we don’t know the exact cause of essential tremor, there is no way to prevent it. But knowing that ET has a genetic link gives researchers clues as they look for treatments and prevention.', 'Can Essential Tremor Be Cured? There is no cure for essential tremor, but treatments that ease symptoms may improve your quality of life. These include drugs and surgery that ease tremor. But not every treatment or procedure is effective for every person with ET. Your doctor will recommend a personal treatment plan, including lifestyle changes that may help reduce your tremors.']"
70,Trichomoniasis (Trich),"['What Is Trichomoniasis? Trichomoniasis , also called trich, is a common sexually transmitted disease (STD). Trich is caused by a tiny one-celled parasite named Trichomonas vaginalis . Anyone who’s sexually active can get it. It affects women more than men, older women more than younger ones, and African American women more than white or Hispanic women. People with trich often don’t have any symptoms, and it doesn’t usually cause problems. But if you don’t get treatment, it raises your chances of getting or spreading other STDs , including HIV.', 'Trichomoniasis Causes You get trich by having sex with someone who has it. Typically, it spreads through contact between a penis and a vagina . Women who have sex with women can also get trich through vaginal contact. Women typically get the infection in their vulva, vagina, cervix , or urethra. Men usually get it in their urethra. They may also get it in their prostate , the gland between the bladder and the penis. It’s rare to have trich in other parts of your body, such as your hands, mouth , or anus . Anyone who has trich can spread it, even if they don’t have symptoms.', 'Trichomoniasis Symptoms About 70% of people with trich don’t have symptoms . In others, the signs might not show up until days or weeks after infection. Women with trichomoniasis may have: Vaginal fluid that smells bad and is greenish or yellowish Genital itching , burning, redness, or soreness Pain when they pee or have sex The need to pee more often Bleeding after sex Men with trichomoniasis may have: Itching or irritation inside their penis A thin white discharge from the penis Pain when they pee or have sex The need to pee more often', 'Trichomoniasis Diagnosis Doctors can diagnose trich by taking a sample of pee or fluid from your genitals and looking at it under a microscope to spot the parasite. Sometimes, they might need to do a test called a culture. This is when they store the sample for several days so the parasite can grow and be easier to find under a microscope. Sensitive tests called nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) can also spot signs of the parasite. Your doctor might test you for other STDs at the same time because many people with trich also have gonorrhea or chlamydia .', 'Trichomoniasis Treatment Antibiotic medications like metronidazole ( Flagyl , Noritate , Nuvessa) and tinidazole ( Tindamax ) clear up the infection in most people. Your doctor will give you pills to swallow, either in one large dose or in several smaller doses. Take all of the medicine, even if you start to feel better before you’re done. Treatment will get rid of the parasite, but you can still get it again. About 20% of people get trich again within 3 months of treatment . Your sex partner or partners should also be treated, even if they don’t have symptoms. Don’t have sex for 7 to 10 days after treatment. Your doctor might want to test you again before you have sex.', 'Trichomoniasis Complications If you don’t get treatment, trich can lead to other health problems. It can raise your risk of getting or spreading other STDs. If you have HIV , trich may make you more likely to spread it. Because of this risk, doctors suggest that women with HIV get tested for trich at least once a year. If you’re pregnant , trich may make you give birth earlier than expected. Your baby may have a low birth weight, which can raise the chances of health or developmental problems. It’s rare, but your baby may also get trich as they go through the birth canal. You can get treated for trich while pregnant, so talk to your doctor about the best options for you.', 'Trichomoniasis Prevention The only way you can totally avoid trich is to not have vaginal sex. You can take other steps to lower your chances of getting it: Always use latex condoms . Because you can get or spread trich through contact alone, make sure to put the condom on early, before it touches the vagina. Avoid douching . Your vagina has a natural balance of bacteria to keep you healthy. When you douche, you remove some of those helpful bacteria, which can raise your chances of getting an STD. Stick with one sex partner who’s tested negative for STDs. If that doesn’t work for you, think about limiting your number of sex partners. Talk openly with your partners about your sexual histories and potential risk of infection. This can help you make the best choice for yourself.']"
71,Trichotillomania: Understanding the Hairpulling Disorder,"[""What Is Trichotillomania? Trichotillomania is a type of impulse control disorder where people have an irresistible urge to pull out their hair , usually from their scalp, eyelashes, and eyebrows. It's also called hairpulling, hairpulling disorder, TTM, and trich. Mental health professionals think of trichotillomania as a “body-focused repetitive behavior.” Body-focused repetitive behaviors are habits like pulling your hair, biting your nails, or chewing on your lips that become extreme or get in the way of enjoying life. Most commonly, people with trichotillomania pull out hair from their scalp. They may also pull out their eyelashes, eyebrows, facial hair (like beards or\xa0mustaches), or armpit, leg, or pubic hair. Often, they pull when they're stressed or bored as a way to soothe themselves. Trichotillomania is a type of impulse control disorder. People with these disorders know that it might be harmful if they act on an impulse like hairpulling, but they cannot stop themselves. Trichotillomania can cause hair loss, including uneven bald patches, that can make people feel self-conscious or embarrassed. This can lead to emotional distress or avoiding social situations. Even though having trichotillomania or pulling your hair is not your fault, there can be social stigma around talking about it."", ""How common is trichotillomania? Doctors aren't sure exactly how common trichotillomania is because many people who have it don't tell their doctors. Stigma can make it hard to ask for help. Scientists think\xa03.5% of all people experience hairpulling at some point in their life, and it might be higher. Trichotillomania is an impulse control disorder sometimes caused by anxiety or stress. This condition can start in childhood and last a lifetime. (Photo credit: Richard Usatine, MD) Why does pulling hair feel good? For many people with trichotillomania, hairpulling is a response to stress, frustration, or boredom. It can feel comforting and give you a place to direct your energy or something to do. Even if you know you might feel upset about it later, pulling can feel pleasant and satisfying in the moment. It might also help you feel in control during stressful situations. Hairpulling can become a habit. This creates a cycle in your brain where you think about the habit and feel the urge to do it. When you do, your brain releases “reward” chemicals like dopamine, which makes you feel happy and calm. Your body then connects doing the habit with feeling good, which in turn strengthens the habit and makes the urge to do it more intense. For people who feel a strong urge to pull, actually pulling can bring a sense of relief because they are no longer focused on the urge."", ""Some people with trichotillomania have rituals or routines related to hairpulling, like choosing which hair to pull or smelling, looking at, playing with, or eating hair you pull out. Rituals of all kinds can be soothing or pleasing to people. Many people also enjoy the sensory experience of the rituals they develop around hairpulling. This can involve any of the senses, such as the sound of pulling out a hair or rubbing it against your hand, the feeling or taste of hair in your mouth, or other sensations. Hairpulling sometimes helps people feel in control of unpleasant physical sensations. For example, some people with trichotillomania who pull on their eyelashes say that they feel an eyelash getting in the way when they blink, so they try to remove the one that's bothering them. In the process, they end up pulling out more eyelashes or get in the habit of pulling. Other people say they feel itchiness or tingling in the area they pull on, and pulling helps get at the itch."", ""Trichotillomania Symptoms The main symptom of trichotillomania is pulling out your hair, often to the point that you have hair loss or bald patches. People with trichotillomania often try to stop pulling but can't. They also say that pulling has negative effects on their lives, self-esteem, or well-being. Pulling can be focused or automatic. With automatic pulling, you aren't aware that you're doing it. Automatic pulling might happen when you're studying, reading, or watching TV and not paying attention. Automatic pulling can be a response to feeling bored. With focused pulling, people know that they are doing it but can't stop themselves. Focused pulling can be a way to ease stress or soothe yourself. People sometimes have rituals or routines for focused pulling, like playing with the hair you pull, tasting it, or smelling it. You might feel relieved or calmer after focused pulling. Most of the time, people with trichotillomania pull out their hair with their fingers, but you might also use tweezers or other tools. Other signs of trichotillomania"", 'Besides repeated hairpulling, other signs of trichotillomania may include: Feeling tense before pulling out your hair or if you try to resist the urge to pull Feeling relieved, satisfied, or pleased after acting on the impulse to pull hair Distress or problems at work, at school, or in your social life due to hairpulling Avoiding situations where people might find out that you pull hair or have hair loss, like sleepovers, swimming, going outside in windy weather, hair salons or barber shops, changing rooms, or sexual intimacy with a partner Conflicts or tension with your friends or family related to pulling Irritated or sore skin from pulling or a tingling feeling or itch that makes you want to pull Scars or damage to your skin, scalp, or hair follicles Rituals like chewing on the hair you pull out, inspecting the hair root, twirling the hair, putting the hair between your teeth , or eating hair A preference for certain types or textures of hair Changes to how you look because of hair loss Bare patches where your hair has been pulled out Pulling fibers from blankets and clothing or hair from pets or dolls', 'If you have trichotillomania, you could also have other body-focused repetitive behaviors, like nail biting, skin picking, or chewing on your lips or cheeks. About 1 in 5 people with trichotillomania also have trichophagia, a related condition that causes you to eat the hair you pull out. If you eat hair, it can lead to problems with digestion like throwing up, nausea, and stomachaches. Over time, you might get blockages or holes in your digestive tract as hair builds up. Many people who have trichotillomania feel\xa0embarrassed or ashamed to let other people know they pull. They may try to hide their\xa0bald patches or hair loss with hats, scarves, or wigs. They might also wear false eyelashes or use makeup to try to cover up the physical effects of trichotillomania. This can be expensive or take a lot of time to do. Some people will stay at home or avoid social situations if they are self-conscious about their hair loss or pulling.', ""Trichotillomania Causes The exact cause of trichotillomania isn't known. Scientists are still learning about it, but they think it might be linked to differences in the parts of your brain related to impulse control, learning, emotion, and movement. It might also be connected to brain chemicals, psychology, your environment, and stress. Some things may boost your risk of trichotillomania, including: Age. Young children sometimes pull out their hair as a way of soothing themselves, and they often outgrow it. More serious forms of trichotillomania often start in the early teens, between ages 10 and 13. Some doctors think it might be linked to the changes in your hormones that happen during puberty. Trichotillomania can last your whole life, though symptoms may come and go. Genes. In some families, the tendency to trichotillomania may be passed on. You're more likely to get it if other people in your family have it . Gender. People of all genders can have trichotillomania. In children and teenagers, the rate of trichotillomania is the same across genders. But adult women are up to nine times more likely than adults of other genders to get diagnosed with it. Some scientists think that this is because people who identify as women might be more likely to tell their doctors about hairpulling or that doctors might pay more attention when women talk about it. Some doctors think hormone changes might affect trichotillomania in people who get periods (menstruate). Other mental health disorders. If you live with trichotillomania, you may have other mental health conditions, such as anxiety, depression, or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Stress. Extreme stress may trigger trichotillomania in some people. Stress can be caused by situations including family conflict, abuse, or the death of a friend or family member. Boredom. Some people start pulling their hair as a way to cope with being bored and then it becomes a habit."", ""Trichotillomania Diagnosis Your doctor or mental health care professional can diagnose you with trichotillomania based on your symptoms. There are no specific tests for it, but your doctor will ask you questions about your habits, stress levels, and experiences pulling your hair. They'll check to make sure you don't have other conditions that could cause pulling or hair loss."", ""Sometimes, your doctor might take a very small piece of skin to look for certain kinds of damage that can happen from pulling. This is called a punch biopsy. They might also look at your hair under a microscope to see if it looks like\xa0it's been pulled out and grown back or look at how much hair you are missing. They may take pictures of your bald patches to help track if treatment works over time. They might send you to a psychiatrist, psychologist, therapist, or other mental health care professional. Your mental health care provider will also ask questions about your hairpulling, your life, and your overall mental health to help figure out what's going on. They will help you learn ways to manage your trichotillomania. Doctors use a guidebook called the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , Fifth edition (DSM-5), to diagnose mental health conditions, including trichotillomania. According to the DSM-5, people with trichotillomania have these five things in common: You pull your hair out. You have tried to stop yourself from pulling but couldn't resist the urge. You feel distressed or upset about pulling or it has negative effects on your life or self-esteem. Your pulling isn't caused by another medical issue. Your pulling isn't caused by another mental health issue."", ""Trichotillomania Treatment Treatment options for trichotillomania include: Therapy Many types of therapy can support people with trichotillomania and even help them stop hairpulling completely. Acceptance and commitment therapy. You'll be able to practice accepting the hairpulling urges without actually hairpulling. Habit reversal. This is often the main treatment of trichotillomania. It'll help you\xa0practice other, less harmful habits instead of hairpulling, like clenching your fists when you have the urge to pull your hair. Cognitive therapy. This helps people explore and change the beliefs that lead to hairpulling. Medications There are no FDA-approved medications for trichotillomania, but these drugs may control symptoms in some people: Antidepressants Atypical antipsychotics N-acetyl cysteine, an amino acid supplement"", 'Trichotillomania Self-Care People with trichotillomania have come up with different ways to help themselves resist the urge to pull. These include: Distractions. Some people might play with a fidget toy or stress ball, knit or crochet, give themselves a manicure, doodle, do a craft project like wood carving or origami, or something else to keep their hands busy when they are bored or feel the urge to pull. New routines or rituals. Many people with trichotillomania have specific routines around pulling that feel good to them. Some people try to create new routines to do instead of pulling. Some examples are repeating a saying you like, giving yourself a hand massage, doing physical exercise, or tightening and then releasing different muscles. Stress management and mindfulness. Sometimes, people pull in response to stress. It might be helpful to use stress management techniques like deep breathing, meditation, or taking a hot bath until the urge goes away. Different sensations. Many people with trichotillomania enjoy certain sensory aspects of pulling, chewing on or smelling their hair, or playing with it in their hands. They might feel itchiness or tingling in the area they pull. Using itch relief cream, putting a washcloth or cold water on the area, or doing something that has a sensation you enjoy might be useful. Making it harder to get to your hair. People sometimes wear hats, scarves, or bandanas to stop themselves from pulling. They might tie their hair back in braids, ponytails, locs, or other styles that make it harder to reach or cut it short. If you use tools like tweezers to pull, you can try hiding them or putting them in a different place each time you use them. Your doctor or mental health professional can help you figure out which ideas might work best for you. Together, you will come up with a personalized plan to treat your trichotillomania. They will work with you to learn and practice different strategies.', ""Trichotillomania Complications Like other body-focused repetitive behaviors, trichotillomania can cause great distress to people who have it. Without treatment, it can lead to different kinds of complications including: Emotional issues and stigma. People say they feel ashamed or\xa0embarrassed about pulling or hair loss. T his can affect self-esteem and self-confidence. People who are too embarrassed to talk about their pulling might feel like they are carrying a big secret or weight. Even though it's not the person's fault, there is still stigma around having trichotillomania. People might worry that no one will understand or that they are the only ones who pull. This can all lead to shame, guilt, or other difficult feelings. These feelings might affect their relationships with their loved ones. Problems at work, at school, or in social settings. People with trichotillomania may avoid friendships, relationships, and intimacy. They might turn down school or job opportunities because they feel down about themselves or embarrassed about pulling. They also might avoid situations like changing rooms, swimming, sleepovers, and overnight trips, where other people might be more likely to notice their pulling or hair loss. This can lead to isolation, feeling left out, or feeling\xa0like you don't belong. Damage to your scalp, skin, or hair. People with trichotillomania often have hair loss or bald or uneven patches on their scalp, body, or face. Repeated pulling can leave tiny scars on your scalp, skin, or hair follicles. Sometimes, this scarring makes it harder for the hair to grow back. People can also get infections or damage to the tissue. Complications from eating hair (trichophagia). About half of all people with trichotillomania put the hair they pull in their mouth in some way, and 1 in 5 swallow or eat it.\xa0Hair is hard for your body to break down, so swallowing it can lead to digestive system problems like\xa0stomachaches, nausea, throwing up, or blockages. It's rare, but sometimes, undigested hair can clump together in your digestive tract and form a tight wad or ball, called a trichobezoar. Trichobezoars can cause blockages and holes in your intestines or other digestive organs, ulcers, weight loss, and other problems. It's important to see a doctor right away if you swallow the hair you pull and you start to have any digestive system issues. If you have a trichobezoar, your doctor will do surgery to take it out."", ""Trichotillomania and eyebrows Some people with trichotillomania also pull out the hair from their eyebrows. This goes beyond usual grooming, and people have trouble resisting the urge to pull their eyebrows. You might use your fingers, tweezers, or other tools. If you only pull your eyebrows, and not any other hair, it's sometimes considered a minor form of trichotillomania. Some people feel itchiness or tingling in their eyebrows and pull in response. Other people pull or over-pluck their eyebrows because they are worried about how they look or to help themselves deal with stress. The skin near your eyebrows is sensitive and can easily get hurt from pulling. If you end up with damage to this area, it will be harder for them to grow back, and they might not be able to grow back all the way. In general, it takes about 3-4 months for eyebrow hair to grow, and it might take longer if your hair or skin has been affected by pulling. To help prevent damage, doctors say to pull your eyebrow hair in the same direction it grows and use angled metal tweezers with sharp, skinny points. Tweezers with rubber tips or wide, flat points are rougher on your hair and skin, which makes it harder for eyebrows to grow back."", ""A doctor or mental health professional can help you recover from trichotillomania and stop pulling. Some people also put cold water, a wet washcloth, coconut oil, or anti-itch cream on their eyebrows. They might also hide their mirrors or tweezers or wear clear glasses to stop themselves from plucking. If you are trying to get your eyebrows to grow back, some doctors recommend taking vitamins like iron, omega-3 supplements, biotin, and a multivitamin. Always check with your doctor about any vitamins or supplements you want to take. Your doctor might give you certain medications or creams to help eyebrow hair grow back. In some severe cases where eyebrows don't grow back, they might suggest getting permanent eyebrow tattoos or hair transplants. Trichotillomania and eyelashes Pulling out your eyelashes can be an issue for you if you have trichotillomania. Eyelashes can be painful to pull, and scientists think that the pain might lead to relief or pleasure. People who pull their eyelashes sometimes say that they feel an eyelash getting caught when they blink, so they try to remove it."", 'People may pull their lower or upper eyelashes or both. Because eyelashes protect your eyes from dust and other irritating things, pulling them out can make you more likely to get eye infections and injuries. Pulling can also hurt the delicate skin on your eyelids, which makes it harder for eyelashes to grow back. If you pull your eyelashes, your eye doctor might tell you to put eye ointment on your eyelids to moisten the area and help the hair grow back. In general, eyelashes replace themselves in 6-10 weeks, but it might take longer if your eyelids are damaged from pulling. Your eye doctor might recommend medications or special creams to help your eyelashes grow back. These treatments can have risks, so make sure to let them know if you pull to help them find the right treatment for you. Eating plenty of fruits, vegetables, protein, and foods with iron in them (red meat, beans, etc.) may help your eyelashes grow faster.', 'Trichotillomania Prevention There is no proven way to prevent trichotillomania, but getting treatment as soon as symptoms start can be a big help. Learning\xa0stress management\xa0is also a good idea because stress often triggers hairpulling behavior.', 'Takeaways Trichotillomania is an uncontrollable urge to pull out your hair that can lead to hair loss, bald patches, and feelings of shame, embarrassment, or isolation. Many people with trichotillomania try to hide their pulling, but help is available. If you struggle with hairpulling, talk to your doctor or a mental health professional.', ""Trichotillomania FAQs Is trichotillomania an OCD or anxiety? According to some experts, trichotillomania is a type of OCD. OCD is a mental health condition that causes overwhelming thoughts that are hard to move on from, called obsessions. These obsessions lead to compulsions, which are actions that you can't stop yourself from doing over and over. People with OCD often feel anxiety or fear about their obsessions. For example, someone might worry obsessively about things being out of order and feel a compulsion to arrange their things in a certain order."", ""While everyone has some obsessive thoughts or compulsions once in a while, if you have OCD, these thoughts and actions have strong, negative effects on your life and make it hard to do daily tasks. Like the urge to pull for people with trichotillomania, they can be very hard or impossible to ignore. Other experts think that trichotillomania is different from OCD, for a few reasons: First of all, many people with trichotillomania feel satisfied, relieved, or happier after they pull. People with OCD usually don't feel better after they do one of their compulsions. Also, people with trichotillomania often pull without thinking about it and don't have obsessive thoughts like with OCD. Treatment of trichotillomania and OCD is often different. Because of this, trichotillomania and OCD can be thought of as “cousins.” Trichotillomania is also linked to anxiety, but scientists don't fully understand the relationship. For example, some people with trichotillomania might feel anxious or depressed because they are embarrassed about pulling. Other people might start pulling as a way to deal with stress or anxiety. We do know that about 3 out of 5 people with trichotillomania also have anxiety."", 'Make sure to tell your care team if you experience obsessive thoughts, compulsions, anxiety, or fear. Your mental health professional can help you figure out if you have OCD or an anxiety disorder and include helping you feel better in your treatment plan. Is trichotillomania related to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)? ADHD is a mental health condition that affects focus, attention, activity, and concentration. While ADHD is not an impulse control disorder like trichotillomania, it can cause problems with impulse control. For this reason, scientists think ADHD and trichotillomania might have some connection with each other, but scientists are still learning about these links. So far, studies have shown that people with trichotillomania are more likely to also have ADHD. In one study that looked at people with trichotillomania, almost 1 in 6 also had ADHD. In general, only about 2 or 3 out of 100 people have ADHD. People who have ADHD and trichotillomania might have more issues with controlling their impulses than people who only have one condition. Scientists think some people with ADHD might pull to help themselves focus. People who have trouble paying attention also might not notice if they are pulling out their hair.']"

This can cause symptoms throughout your body. Sores inside your mouth and on your genitals are common, but you may also have symptoms in other areas. There’s no cure for Behcet’s syndrome, but there are ways to treat the symptoms.', 'Behcet’s Syndrome Signs and Symptoms Behcet’s syndrome is different for everyone. Some people have only mild symptoms. Others have more serious problems. Your symptoms often come and go. Bouts of symptoms are called flares. Going long periods without symptoms is called remission. Most people with Behcet’s syndrome have sores in the mouth and on the genitals. But the swelling of blood vessels it causes can bring on symptoms throughout your body: Mouth: Sores on the lips, tongue , and inside of the cheek Mouth pain Eyes : Swelling in the front or back of the eye , called uveitis Blurry vision Sensitivity to light Tearing Redness Pain Vision loss', 'Genitals: Sores on the scrotum in men Sores on the vulva in women Skin : Bumps that look like acne Red lumps on the legs and ankles Joints: Pain in the knees, ankles, wrists, and elbows Joint swelling Brain and spinal cord: Fever Headache Stiff neck Confusion Personality changes Memory loss Trouble speaking Digestive system : Stomach pain Diarrhea Bleeding from sores in the stomach and intestines Sometimes, Behcet’s affects other organs, like the kidneys and lungs .', 'Behcet’s Syndrome Causes and Risk Factors Doctors aren’t sure what causes Behcet’s syndrome. They believe it starts when the immune system mistakenly attacks the blood vessels. You’re more likely to get it if you have a problem with your immune system. Some people inherit genes that cause their immune system to attack the blood vessels. Doctors believe an infection or something else in the environment triggers the condition in those who have the gene. Risk factors Some things can make you more likely to have Behcet’s syndrome, including: Age: Although you can get it at any age, it usually shows up when you’re in your 20s or 30s. Genes: Certain genes (a portion of your DNA) are linked to this condition. Sex: Although anyone can get it, it affects more men, more severely, than women. Where you live: Behcet’s syndrome is very rare in the U.S. It’s more common in the Middle East and Asia.', 'Behcet’s Syndrome Diagnosis Because there are so many different symptoms, Behcet’s syndrome can be hard to diagnose. It has symptoms similar to many other conditions, including Crohn’s disease, lupus , and arthritis . Your doctor may want to give you a blood test to rule out other conditions. It can take months to find out for sure that you have Behcet’s. Doctors will look at your medical history, do a physical exam , and look for groups of symptoms. You may be diagnosed with Behcet’s if you have mouth sores at least three times in a year, and you have at least two of these symptoms: Sores on your genitals Swelling in your eyes , along with vision loss Skin sores Positive pathergy test: Your doctor will prick your arm with a small needle.

Corticosteroids can calm the immune system and bring down swelling in your body. Other medicines that work to help your immune system response can also be prescribed, such as adalimumab ( Humira ), azathioprine ( Imuran ), cyclophosphamide , cyclosporine ( Neoral , Sandimmune ), and infliximab ( Remicade ). Creams or ointments can ease skin and genital sores. Your doctor may recommend nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs , or NSAIDs , and colchicine for joint pain and swelling. Steroid eye drops can bring down eye swelling.', 'Behcet’s Syndrome Complications Depending on your symptoms, it’s possible you could get complications from Behcet’s syndrome. But not everyone will. It’s important to see your doctor if you are noticing new symptoms. For example, if you have eye inflammation that goes untreated, it can result in loss of vision . Treatment can help prevent this. Blood clots can also cause serious complications. A pulmonary artery aneurism (when there’s a bulge in your artery that can burst) is rare but can be fatal. Inflammation in your brain or spinal cord can also cause disability. Always call your doctor if you have questions or new symptoms.', 'Behcet’s Syndrome Outlook You can live an active life with Behcet’s. Your symptoms might get better as you grow older.

73,Risks Linked With Twin Births,"[""No pregnancy is entirely free of risks. But carrying twins can put you and your babies at increased risk for certain pregnancy-related complications, including premature birth and diabetes. Don't let this alarm you. With good prenatal care, you can greatly increase your chances of enjoying a healthy pregnancy and healthy babies."", ""What Are My Risks? With twins, you're at greater risk for: Premature birth. Twins are born prematurely more than half the time. That's before the end of 36 weeks of pregnancy. Premature babies may have health problems as newborns. Sometimes they also have lasting disabilities. Low birth weight (LBW). More than half of twins are born with LBW, weighing less than 5 1/2 pounds. LBW babies are at increased risk of health problems after birth, such as: Vision and hearing loss Mental disabilities Cerebral palsy However, know that this is more likely if babies are born before 32 weeks or weighing less than 3 1/3 pounds. Twin to twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) occurs in identical twins or multiples when the blood vessels of the babies’ shared placenta are connected causing one twin to transfer more blood to the other. At birth, the babies have different skin color because of the blood flow with one usually being abnormally pale and the other appearing red. Over time, their colors will change as normal blood counts are established. TTTS occurs about 15 % of the time among identical twins. Twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS). This condition affects about 10% of identical twins, who share a placenta. TTTS develops when a connection between the babies' blood vessels allows one baby to get too little blood and the other too much. A doctor can treat TTTS with laser surgery to seal off the vessel connection or with amniocentesis to drain excess amniotic fluid."", 'Preeclampsia . You are more than twice as likely to develop preeclampsia than women carrying one baby. Preeclampsia is marked by: High blood pressure Swelling Headache Vision changes If you have this, you may need early delivery to prevent serious complications. If not treated, preeclampsia can deprive your baby of oxygen and nutrients and can damage your organs. Gestational diabetes . If you develop diabetes (high blood sugar) during pregnancy, your babies may grow too big. Delivering big babies increases your risk of complications during delivery, and may require you to deliver by cesarean. Your babies may also have breathing problems and low blood sugar when they are born. But you can take steps, such as with diet, to lower your risk. Iron deficiency anemia . A lack of healthy red blood cells from too little iron can lead to premature birth. Be sure to add iron to your diet as recommended by your doctor. Yes, these are serious risks, but try not to worry too much. With good prenatal care, you and your doctor can lower your risk and spot any problems earlier, rather than later. Then you can work with your doctor to manage and minimize the impact of any complications.']"

Trisomy 13, sometimes called Patau syndrome, is a rare genetic condition that happens when babies have an extra 13th chromosome. Chromosomes in our cells carry DNA, which controls how our bodies develop. Usually, people have 23 pairs of chromosomes, half from each parent. But babies with trisomy 13 have three copies of chromosome 13 instead of two. This causes very serious physical and mental issues. If you're carrying a fetus with trisomy 13, a miscarriage is likely. Most babies born with it don’t live past their first year, though some can survive much longer. This condition affects 1 in every 10,000 to 20,000 newborns."", ""Trisomy 13 Causes Trisomy 13 syndrome happens when cells don't divide normally while a fetus is forming.

But these tests can’t tell your doctor whether your fetus definitely has trisomy 13. They can only show that it's more likely. To make sure, your doctor will likely recommend a karyotype test, such as a chorionic villus sampling (CVS) or amniocentesis, the most common diagnostic test for trisomy 13.

No, but both are conditions in which three chromosomes are present instead of two. Down syndrome, also known medically as trisomy 21, affects the 21st chromosome.']"
75,What Is Trisomy 18?,"['Trisomy 18 Explained Trisomy 18 is a condition caused by a problem in your chromosomes. It\'s also called Edwards syndrome, after the doctor who first described it. Chromosomes are the threadlike structures in cells that hold genes. Genes carry the instructions needed to make every part of a baby\'s body. Trisomy 18 is a condition where you have three copies of chromosome 18 in your body\'s cells instead of two. (Photo Credit: KATERYNA KON/Science Source) When an egg and sperm join and form an embryo, their chromosomes combine. Each baby gets 23 chromosomes from the mother\'s egg and 23 chromosomes from the father\'s sperm – 46 in total. Sometimes the mother\'s egg or the father\'s sperm contains the wrong number of chromosomes. As the egg and sperm combine, this mistake is passed on to the baby. A ""trisomy"" means that the baby has an extra chromosome in some or all of the body\'s cells. In the case of trisomy 18, the baby has three copies of chromosome 18. This causes many of the baby\'s organs to develop in an abnormal way. Types of trisomy 18 There are three types of trisomy 18: Full trisomy 18. The extra chromosome is in every cell in the baby\'s body. This is by far the most common type of trisomy 18. Partial trisomy 18. The child has only part of an extra chromosome 18. That extra part may be attached to another chromosome in the egg or sperm (called a translocation). This type of trisomy 18 is very rare. Mosaic trisomy 18. The extra chromosome 18 is only in some of the baby\'s cells. This form of trisomy 18 is also rare.', ""How Common Is Trisomy 18? Trisomy 18 is the second-most common type of trisomy syndrome, after trisomy 21 (Down syndrome). About 1 in every 5,000 babies are born with trisomy 18, and most are female. The condition is even more common than that, but many babies with trisomy 18 don't survive past the second or third trimester of pregnancy ."", 'Symptoms of Trisomy 18 Babies with trisomy 18 are often born very small and frail. They typically have many serious health problems and physical defects, including: Cleft palate Clenched fists with overlapping fingers that are hard to straighten Defects of the lungs , kidneys , and stomach / intestines Deformed feet (called ""rocker-bottom feet"" because they\'re shaped like the bottom of a rocking chair) Feeding problems Heart defects, including a hole between the heart \'s upper (atrial septal defect) or lower (ventricular septal defect) chambers Low-set ears Severe developmental delays and mental disabilities Chest deformity Slowed growth Small head ( microcephaly ) Small jaw (micrognathia) Weak cry', ""Risk Factors for Trisomy 18 The risk of having a child with trisomy 18 increases with the age of the mother, though women of any age can have a child with trisomy 18. There isn't anything you can do to lessen your chances of having a child with the condition as it's due to a chromosome disorder. If you've had one baby with trisomy 18, the risk of having another with it is 0.5% to 1%. If you or your partner is a carrier of a chromosome disorder that leads to partial trisomy 18, the risk of having another child with this condition could be as high as 20%."", ""Trisomy 18 Diagnosis The doctor usually will do a screening test using some of the mother's blood. The test can't say for sure if your baby will have trisomy 18, but it can tell if your baby is at risk for it – and for other diseases that come from chromosome errors. To diagnose trisomy 18, your doctor will take cells from the amniotic fluid ( amniocentesis ) or placenta (chorionic villus sampling) and analyze their chromosomes. These tests are done after the screening test because they carry a small risk of miscarriage or early labor."", ""Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) is done in the first trimester, and amniocentesis is done in the second or third trimester. Trisomy 18 ultrasound Around 12 weeks of pregnancy or later, your doctor can do an ultrasound, which will give them a picture of what your fetus looks like. It may tell them if your baby has trisomy 18, but it's usually confirmed by the CVS or amniocentesis. Some of the things a doctor may see on an ultrasound if your baby has trisomy 18 include a smaller size, problems with the intestines, and problems with the limbs, like clenched fists. After birth, the doctor may suspect trisomy 18 based on your child's face and body. A blood sample can be taken to look for the chromosome disorder. The chromosome blood test can also help determine how likely you are to have another baby with trisomy 18. If you're concerned that your baby may be at risk for trisomy 18 because of a past pregnancy, you may want to see a genetic counselor."", 'Treatment for Trisomy 18 There is no cure for trisomy 18. Treatment for trisomy 18 consists of supportive medical care to provide the child with the best quality of life possible. This might include: Surgeries, especially for heart defects Medicines Feeding tubes Breathing tubes Providing comfort care (as opposed to treatments) At one time, babies born with trisomy 18 were not resuscitated at birth because their long-term chances of survival were so low. Now, guidelines have changed, and reviving infants with trisomy 18 is more likely to be done. The Textbook of Neonatal Resuscitation has removed trisomy 18 from the list of diagnoses that it considers ethical to not resuscitate at birth.', ""Trisomy 18 Life Expectancy Because trisomy 18 causes such serious physical defects, many babies with the condition don't survive to birth. About half of babies who are carried full-term are stillborn. Boys with trisomy 18 are more likely to be stillborn than girls. Of those babies who do survive, half die within the first week of life. Fewer than 10% live to reach their first birthday. Children who do live past that milestone often have severe health problems that require a large amount of care. Only a very small number of people with this condition live into their 20s or 30s.

76,Ectopic Pregnancy: What to Know,"['What Is Ectopic Pregnancy? Ectopic pregnancy happens when a fertilized egg implants itself outside of the womb, such as in a fallopian tube. A look at the symptoms of the condition and how doctors treat it. (Photo Credit: Science Photo Library/Getty Images) Usually, a fertilized egg attaches itself to the lining in your uterus. But with an ectopic pregnancy (also called extrauterine pregnancy), the fertilized egg grows outside your uterus. This can include other areas like a fallopian tube, the ovaries, in your belly, or the lower part of your cervix, which is above the vagina. In more than 90% of cases, the egg attaches itself in a fallopian tube. This is called a tubal pregnancy. How common are ectopic pregnancies? Rates are hard to determine, but one study suggests that about 1 in 50 pregnancies in the U.S. are ectopic. As the fertilized egg grows, it can burst (rupture) and can cause life-threatening bleeding. If this happens, you will need medical care right away. If you don\'t treat it, it can be deadly. In fact, ectopic pregnancies are the leading cause of pregnancy-related deaths in the first trimester . Can a baby survive an ectopic pregnancy? No. It\'s important to note that the fertilized egg in an ectopic pregnancy is not ""viable."" That means it\'s impossible for the egg to survive and grow into a baby that can survive in or outside your body. It will always result in a pregnancy loss. That\'s because the egg can\'t get the blood supply and support it needs to grow outside of the uterus. Ectopic pregnancy vs. miscarriage A miscarriage is when you abruptly lose a pregnancy before the 20th week. So while an ectopic pregnancy ends in a miscarriage, miscarriages can happen for other reasons like extra or missing chromosomes.', 'Ectopic Pregnancy Symptoms At first, you may not have any symptoms of an early ectopic pregnancy. They may seem very similar to those of a normal pregnancy. You might miss your period and have discomfort in your belly and tenderness in your breasts . Only about half of women with an ectopic pregnancy will have all three of the main signs: a missed period, vaginal bleeding, and belly pain. Early signs of an ectopic pregnancy include: Upset stomach and vomiting Sharp belly cramps Pain on one side of your body Dizziness or weakness Pain in your shoulder, neck, or rectum Signs of a ruptured ectopic pregnancy An ectopic pregnancy can cause your fallopian tube to burst, or rupture. Emergency symptoms include major pain, with or without severe bleeding. Call your doctor right away if you have heavy vaginal bleeding with lightheadedness, fainting , or shoulder pain, or if you have severe belly pain, especially on one side. You might need to call 911 or head to the nearest hospital to have it treated right away.', 'When Do Ectopic Pregnancy Symptoms Start? Symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy usually develop fairly early in the pregnancy: between the 4th and 12th weeks.', ""Ectopic Pregnancy Locations While most ectopic pregnancies happen in a fallopian tube, an egg can also attach itself to other areas outside of your uterus. Other types of ectopic pregnancy include: Ovarian ectopic pregnancy (OEP) When a fertilized egg implants on the outside of your ovary, it causes this type of ectopic pregnancy. OEP could happen because of problems with how your body releases eggs during your menstrual cycle. It's possible that an egg is fertilized while it's still in the follicle (a structure in the ovary), and OEP may happen as the egg moves from your fallopian tube to your ovary. Abdominal ectopic pregnancy In rare cases, a pregnancy happens in the space between your abdominal wall and spine (abdominal cavity). With this type of ectopic pregnancy, the movement of fluid in the abdomen may transport an egg behind the uterus where a sperm fertilizes it. Or an embryo might move from the reproductive tract to the abdominal cavity by traveling through lymphatic channels."", 'Cervical ectopic pregnancy This type of ectopic pregnancy happens when an egg implants in the cervical canal, and may happen because of damage to the space inside your uterus (uterine cavity). Cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy (CSEP) CSEP is when a fertilized egg attaches to scar tissue from a C-section. Since scar tissue is weaker than the lining of your uterus, it can tear and cause heavy bleeding. Symptoms of these ectopic pregnancies, like bleeding from your vagina and lower belly pain, are similar to the kind that happen in your fallopian tube.', 'Ectopic Pregnancy Causes You may never know why you have an ectopic pregnancy. One cause could be a damaged fallopian tube. It could keep the fertilized egg from getting into your uterus.', ""Ectopic Pregnancy Risk Factors You're more likely to have an ectopic pregnancy if you: Smoke cigarettes Are older than 35 Have a sexually transmitted infection Have scarring from pelvic surgery Had a previous ectopic pregnancy Tried to have tubal ligation (tubes tied) or tubal ligation reversal Had fertility treatments such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) It could also happen if you become pregnant while you have an intrauterine device (IUD) for birth control ."", 'Ectopic Pregnancy and Endometriosis Endometriosis is a painful condition where tissue like the kind found lining your uterus grows outside of the uterus. It usually forms on the ovaries, fallopian tubes, and tissue lining the pelvis. Scarring from the condition may stop a fertilized egg from reaching the uterus, causing an ectopic pregnancy.', ""Ectopic Pregnancy Complications During an ectopic pregnancy, the fertilized egg is wrapped in a structure that can grow for several weeks outside your uterus. But the structure usually bursts between 6 and 16 weeks. A ruptured ectopic pregnancy can cause severe bleeding. If the bleeding isn't stopped, your body might start to shut down due to the blood loss (hemorrhagic shock), and the odds of dying from it increase. If it's treated before it bursts, it rarely results in death. If the structure does burst, it may damage the fallopian tube it was attached to. Your doctor might remove the fallopian tube during the surgery. But you have two fallopian tubes. If your other fallopian tube is healthy, you should still be able to get pregnant. But if your other fallopian tube is damaged or not there, you may have fertility issues. In this case, talk to your doctor about other ways to get pregnant , like IVF (in vitro fertilization)."", 'Ectopic Pregnancy Diagnosis Your doctor will probably do tests that include a pregnancy test and a pelvic exam. They might give you an ultrasound to look at your uterus and fallopian tubes. An ultrasound for ectopic pregnancy is a noninvasive test that uses sound waves to create images of the inside of the uterus. The test is performed by a sonographer and may be done transvaginally or transabdominally. During the ultrasound, the doctor will look for the presence of a gestational sac, the location of the gestational sac, and whether there is a fetal heartbeat. The test is painless and usually takes around 15 to 20 minutes. An abdominal ultrasound test, which is performed by moving a wand over the abdomen, may be used to confirm pregnancy or check for internal bleeding.', ""Ectopic Pregnancy Treatment Because a fertilized egg can't survive outside a uterus, your doctor will need to take it out, so you don't have serious health problems. They'll use one of two methods: medication or surgery."", 'Methotrexate for ectopic pregnancy If your fallopian tube hasn\'t ruptured and your pregnancy isn\'t far along, your doctor can give you a shot of methotrexate (Trexall). You only need one dose of the injection. It stops the fertilized egg from growing. Your body will absorb the egg in about 4-6 weeks. With this treatment, there\'s no need to remove the fallopian tube. Before you can take methotrexate, your doctor will need to run a few blood tests to measure your levels of hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin). It\'s the hormone your body makes when it detects a pregnancy. You won\'t be able to take methotrexate if you\'re breastfeeding or have certain health problems. Once you get the shot, the doctor will check your hCG levels during follow-up appointments. If your levels don\'t drop after the first dose, you might need a second dose of the same medication. You\'ll need to follow up until your blood no longer has hCG. It\'s important to note that taking methotrexate is not the same as having a medical abortion, as you could get if you had a ""viable"" pregnancy in which the fertilized egg attaches inside the uterus. For a medical abortion, you need a combination of two prescription drugs: mifepristone and misoprostol.', ""The methotrexate that you take during an ectopic pregnancy before the egg bursts is medically necessary. It can lower your risk of dying or other serious complications. Surgery for ectopic pregnancy In other cases, you'll need surgery. The most common is laparoscopy . Your doctor will make very small cuts in your lower belly and insert a thin, flexible tube called a laparoscope to remove the ectopic pregnancy. If your fallopian tube is damaged, they may have to remove it as well. If you're bleeding a lot or your doctor suspects that your fallopian tube is ruptured, you might need emergency surgery with a larger cut. This is called a laparotomy. Surgery side effects can include: Pain Bleeding Infection Whether you take methotrexate or have surgery, you may feel tired for a few weeks and have some discomfort in your belly. You may continue to have pregnancy-like symptoms for a bit. It might take a few period cycles before you feel back to normal."", ""After an Ectopic Pregnancy It might be hard for you to have a typical pregnancy afterward. Consider talking to a fertility specialist, especially if you had a fallopian tube removed. And talk to your doctor about how long to wait before trying again. Some experts suggest giving yourself at least 3 months so your body has time to heal. An ectopic pregnancy raises your risk of having another one. If you think you're having another pregnancy, be mindful of the changes in your body. Check with your doctor, and they can confirm it and take the necessary steps. An ectopic pregnancy can take a toll on your mental health , too. Don't hesitate to reach out to mental health experts like a licensed counselor or therapist."", ""How to Avoid an Ectopic Pregnancy There's no way to prevent an ectopic pregnancy. But you can lower your odds with certain lifestyle choices. You can: Use a condom when you have sex. This can lower your risk for pelvic inflammatory disease and sexually transmitted infections. Avoid using a vaginal douche. Studies show that using a douche can increase the risk of ectopic pregnancy.""]"

They are not cancerous, but TSC can cause issues depending on wear the tumors grow.  They first appear as small red dots and then later grow into fibromas. If they develop in your lungs, it could affect your ability to breathe. The disease may also cause tuber-like growths on the brain, which calcify and harden (becoming sclerotic) with age. This may cause retardation and seizures. Symptoms usually show up soon after birth. There is no cure for TS, but its symptoms can be treated and managed. About a third of people inherit TSC from a parent. If one of your parents has it, you have a 50% chance of getting it.', ""Symptoms Symptoms usually show up early, shortly after birth. But they can also appear later in life. Your symptoms depend on how many tumors you have, how big they are, and where they are. When you have TSC, all of that can change throughout your life. Tumors in a kidney can stop it from working like it should. They can also cause bleeding inside your body or high blood pressure. Tumors in your heart usually happen when you're young, and they shrink over time. But they can block blood flow or cause problems with your heart rhythm. Lung tumors can make you short of breath, even after mild exercise. They can also cause a cough or make your lung collapse. Tumors in your brain could cause: Seizures , which can be mild at first Behavior changes, such as temper tantrums , anxiety, or sleep problems Nausea or headaches Problems such as autism and developmental delays Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetic condition which affects how your cells divide. Growths can occur in many places in your body including, your skin, lungs, kidneys, heart and brain. TSC tumors aren’t cancerous, but they can cause problems where they’re growing.

Your doctor may check your eyes and skin, as well as ask you to get imaging tests. These can include: A CT scan. This series of X-rays creates detailed pictures of your body to check for tumors and other changes related to the disease. An MRI. This makes a more detailed image than CT. An MRI scan can show how blood and spinal fluid are flowing, and can help pinpoint locations of tumors and other changes. The doctor may inject a dye to make certain kinds of tissue look different in the image. That helps them see changes faster and clearer. An echocardiogram is an ultrasound test of the heart. It shows tumors and other changes in the heart. Gene tests, done from a blood sample, can also confirm that you have TSC.', 'Questions for Your Doctor How fast might the tumors grow? How do the tumors cause the symptoms? How might my symptoms change over time? What treatments are available? What are the possible complications from those treatments?

If TSC is affecting your kidneys , doctors may be able to block or reduce blood flow to kidney tumors, or give you drugs to help shrink them. You may need surgery to remove the tumors. At some point, you may also need dialysis or a kidney transplant.', 'If you have tumors in your brain , sometimes drugs can shrink them, or surgeons can remove them.', 'The drug Afinitor (everolimus) is approved by the FDA to treat specific types of brain and kidney tumors caused by TSC, too. When a child with seizures gets treated, it helps their brain develop, and they can learn better. Some people with lung problems from TSC take the drug sirolimus , which works on your immune system. Laser treatment ( dermabrasion ) can help ""refinish,"" or smooth your skin before tumors become large.', ""Taking Care of Yourself Having a disease like TSC can be tough, so find ways to reduce your stress and keep doing the things you love.

It often affects rabbits and other animals including rodents, sheep, and birds. House pets like dogs and cats can get tularemia too. These are some of the ways people can get it: Insect bites , especially from a deer fly or tick Coming into contact with the skin, hair , or meat of an animal that’s infected Consuming contaminated water or food, such as undercooked meat Breathing in bacteria that comes up from the soil during an activity like construction or gardening It’s also possible to become infected if you’re exposed to the bacteria in a laboratory setting, or potentially, in an act of bioterrorism. Tularemia can happen anywhere in the world, but it’s most common in rural areas where animals are more likely to be infected with the bacteria. It can survive in soil, water , and dead animals for weeks. That’s why it can cause infections in so many different ways. The way you become infected with the disease influences the type of symptoms you’ll have and how severe they may be. But just because you’re exposed to the bacteria doesn’t mean you’ll become sick with the disease.', 'Symptoms If you do become sick after being exposed to Francisella tularensis , you’re likely to start having symptoms within 3 to 5 days, but it can take up to 2 weeks.

The condition can cause symptoms throughout your life, but treatments and continued research help people manage their condition.', 'Turner Syndrome Causes Turner syndrome happens when a female is missing certain genes that are normally on the X chromosome. (Females have two X chromosomes. Males have an X and a Y). Some girls with Turner are actually missing a whole copy of the X chromosome. For others, just part of one containing the particular set of genes is missing. The different ways genes can be affected include: Monosomy . A problem with the mom’s egg or dad’s sperm causes an absence of the X chromosome in every cell of the body. Mosaicism . When cell division during early stages of fetal development doesn’t happen correctly, some cells in the body get two complete copies of the X chromosome. Other cells have only one copy.', 'X chromosome abnormalities . Cells have one complete copy and one abnormal or missing copy of the X chromosome. Y chromosome material . In a few cases, some cells get one copy of the X chromosome and other cells get one copy of the X chromosome and some Y chromosome material. Biologically, you develop as a female. The Y chromosome material increases your risk of a type of cancer called gonadoblastoma. About 70,000 U.S. women and girls live with it. Research has found that almost 99% of babies missing the chromosome are miscarried. But about 1% of the time, these babies are born, and they have the syndrome.', 'Symptoms of Turner Syndrome Signs of Turner syndrome can start even before birth, and they give parents some idea that their baby might be born with the condition. An ultrasound of a baby with it may show heart and kidney problems or a buildup of fluid.', 'A DNA test using a blood sample from the mother can also screen for Turner syndrome before birth.', 'At birth or during infancy, girls might have a number of physical features that point to the condition. Swollen hands and feet or smaller than average height at birth are among them. Others include: A wide or weblike neck with extra folds of skin Receding or small lower jaw and a high, narrow roof of the mouth (palate) Low-set ears and a low hairline Broad chest with widely spaced nipples Arms that turn outward at the elbows Short fingers and toes and narrow fingernails and toenails Delayed growth Heart defects Down-turning eyelids Short roots of teeth Kidney abnormalities Greater than usual number of moles on the skin In older females, throughout the lifespan, symptoms can continue.

If you’re able to become pregnant , high blood pressure and gestational diabetes might be issues.', 'Turner Syndrome Diagnosis If an ultrasound shows something abnormal while you’re pregnant, your doctor may want to examine your baby’s chromosomes with a karyotype. This test compares chromosomes by lining them up. To get samples from you, your doctor may recommend: Amniocentesis. This is when protective fluid that surrounds a baby is taken from your uterus. Blood sample. This can help find out whether the baby is missing all or part of an X chromosome. Chorionic villus sampling (CVS). Your doctor removes tissue samples from a portion of the placenta for testing. This test is typically done around 10-12 weeks of pregnancy. Cheek scraping or skin sample. Your doctor may be able to test you using cells scraped from the inside of your cheek (buccal smear), or a sample of skin cells. If a diagnosis isn’t made before or at birth, other lab tests that check hormones, thyroid function and blood sugar can help diagnose it. Because of the problems linked to Turner syndrome, doctors will also often suggest tests for the kidneys, heart, and hearing.', 'Turner Syndrome Treatments Medical care often calls for a team of specialists that’s built around the specific needs of each person, because the cases vary so widely. There’s no cure, but most girls will take the same main therapies during childhood and the teen years. These are: Growth hormone , given as an injection a few times a week, to increase height as much as possible. Estrogen therapy, beginning around the time of puberty until a woman reaches the average age of menopause . This hormone treatment can help a woman grow and reach adult sexual development. Almost all women with the condition need fertility treatments to become pregnant. And carrying a child can come with health risks. If you have Turner syndrome, you should discuss those issues with your doctor.']"
80,Type 1 Diabetes,"['What Is Type 1 Diabetes? Type 1 diabetes is a condition in which your immune system destroys insulin -making cells in your pancreas . These are called beta cells. The condition is usually diagnosed in children and young people , so it used to be called juvenile diabetes. A condition called secondary diabetes is like type 1 , but your beta cells are wiped out by something else, like a disease or an injury to your pancreas, rather than by your immune system. Both of these are different from type 2 diabetes , in which your body doesn’t respond to insulin the way it should.', 'Type 1 Diabetes Symptoms Signs are often subtle, but they can become severe. They include: Extreme thirst Increased hunger (especially after eating) Dry mouth Upset stomach and vomiting Frequent urination Unexplained weight loss, even though you’re eating and feel hungry Fatigue Blurry vision Heavy, labored breathing (your doctor may call this Kussmaul respiration) Frequent infections of your skin , urinary tract, or vagina Crankiness or mood changes Bedwetting in a child who’s been dry at night Signs of an emergency with type 1 diabetes include: Shaking and confusion Rapid breathing Fruity smell to your breath Belly pain Loss of consciousness (rare)', ""Type 1 Diabetes Causes Insulin is a hormone that helps move sugar, or glucose, into your body's tissues. Your cells use it as fuel. Damage to beta cells from type 1 diabetes throws the process off. Glucose doesn’t move into your cells because insulin isn’t there to do the job. Instead, it builds up in your blood , and your cells starve. This causes high blood sugar , which can lead to: Dehydration . When there’s extra sugar in your blood, you pee more. That’s your body’s way of getting rid of it. A large amount of water goes out with that urine , causing your body to dry out. Weight loss. The glucose that goes out when you pee takes calories with it. That’s why many people with high blood sugar lose weight. Dehydration also plays a part. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). If your body can't get enough glucose for fuel, it breaks down fat cells instead. This creates chemicals called ketones. Your liver releases the sugar it stores to help out. But your body can’t use it without insulin, so it builds up in your blood, along with the acidic ketones. This mix of extra glucose, dehydration, and acid buildup is known as ketoacidosis and can be life-threatening if not treated right away. Damage to your body. Over time, high glucose levels in your blood can harm the nerves and small blood vessels in your eyes , kidneys , and heart . They can also make you more likely to get hardened arteries , or atherosclerosis , which can lead to heart attacks and strokes."", ""There’s no way to prevent type 1 diabetes. Doctors don't know all the things that cause it. But they know that your genes play a role. They also know that you can get type 1 diabetes when something around you, like a virus, tells your immune system to go after your pancreas . Most people with type 1 diabetes have signs of this attack, called autoantibodies. They’re there in almost everyone who has the condition when their blood sugar is high. Type 1 diabetes can happen along with other autoimmune diseases , like Graves’ disease or vitiligo."", 'Type 1 Diabetes Risk Factors Only about 5% of people with diabetes have type 1.

They may test your urine for glucose or chemicals your body makes when you don’t have enough insulin.', 'Type 1 Diabetes Treatment People who have type 1 diabetes can live long, healthy lives. You’ll need to keep a close eye on your blood sugar levels . Your doctor will give you a range that the numbers should stay within. Adjust your insulin, food, and activities as necessary. Everyone with type 1 diabetes needs to use insulin shots to control their blood sugar. When your doctor talks about insulin, they’ll mention three main things: ""Onset"" is how long it takes to reach your bloodstream and begin lowering your blood sugar. ""Peak time"" is when insulin is doing the most work in terms of lowering your blood sugar. ""Duration"" is how long it keeps working after onset. Several types of insulin are available. Rapid-acting starts to work in about 15 minutes. It peaks about 1 hour after you take it and continues to work for 2 to 4 hours. Regular or short-acting gets to work in about 30 minutes. It peaks between 2 and 3 hours and keeps working for 3 to 6 hours. Intermediate-acting won’t get into your bloodstream for 2 to 4 hours after your shot. It peaks from 4 to 12 hours and works for 12 to 18 hours. Long-acting takes several hours to get into your system and lasts about 24 hours.', 'Your doctor may start you out with two injections a day of two types of insulin. Later, you might need more shots. Most insulin comes in a small glass bottle called a vial. You draw it out with a syringe that has a needle on the end and give yourself the shot. Some kinds come in a prefilled pen. Another kind is inhaled. You can also get it from a pump, a device you wear that sends it into your body through a small tube. Your doctor will help you pick the type and the delivery method that’s best for you.', ""Lifestyle Changes Exercise is an important part of treating type 1. But it isn’t as simple as going for a run. Exercise affects your blood sugar levels. So you have to balance your insulin dose and the food you eat with any activity, even simple tasks around the house or yard. Knowledge is power. Check your blood sugar before, during, and after an activity to find out how it affects you. Some things will make your levels go up; others won't. You can lower your insulin or have a snack with carbs to keep it from dropping too low."", 'If your blood sugar is high -- above 240 mg/dL -- test for ketones, the acids that can result from high sugar levels. If they’re OK, you should be good to go. If they’re high, skip the workout . You’ll also need to understand how food affects your blood sugar. Once you know the roles that carbs, fats, and protein play, you can build a healthy eating plan that helps keep your levels where they should be. A diabetes educator or registered dietitian can help you get started.', 'Type 1 Diabetes Complications Type 1 diabetes can lead to other problems, especially if it isn’t well-controlled. Complications include: Cardiovascular disease . Diabetes can put you at higher risk of blood clots , as well as high blood pressure and cholesterol. These can lead to chest pain , heart attack, stroke , or heart failure . Skin problems . People with diabetes are more likely to get bacterial or fungal infections. Diabetes can also cause blisters or rashes . Gum disease . A lack of saliva , too much plaque, and poor blood flow can cause mouth problems. Pregnancy problems . Women with type 1 diabetes have a higher risk of early delivery, birth defects, stillbirth, and preeclampsia . Retinopathy. This eye problem happens in about 80% of adults who have had type 1 diabetes for more than 15 years. It’s rare before puberty , no matter how long you’ve had the disease. To prevent it -- and keep your eyesight -- keep good control of blood sugar, blood pressure , cholesterol , and triglycerides . Kidney damage. About 20% to 30% of people with type 1 diabetes get a condition called nephropathy. The chances go up over time. It’s most likely to show up 15 to 25 years after the onset of diabetes. It can lead to other serious problems like kidney failure and heart disease. Poor blood flow and nerve damage . Damaged nerves and hardened arteries lead to a loss of feeling in and a lack of blood supply to your feet . This raises your chances of injury and makes it harder for open sores and wounds to heal. When that happens, you could lose a limb. Nerve damage can also cause digestive problems like nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea . You can take steps to keep from getting complications.

With type 2, your pancreas makes some insulin -- the hormone that helps your cells turn glucose (a type of sugar) from the food you eat into energy. In some people, your cells don't respond to this hormone as they should (a condition called insulin resistance). Type 1 diabetes In type 1, your immune system attacks and destroys the cells in your pancreas that make insulin, leading to high blood sugar. Doctors aren't sure why this happens. Type 1 isn't related to weight or lifestyle habits. It used to be called insulin-dependent or childhood diabetes. Gestational diabetes You only get this type of diabetes when you're pregnant. It happens because hormonal changes and weight gain during pregnancy can lead to insulin resistance. It usually goes away after you have your baby."", ""Causes of Type 2 Diabetes Usually, a combination of things causes type 2 diabetes. They might include: Genes. Scientists have found different bits of DNA that affect how your body makes insulin. Weight. Having extra weight or obesity can cause insulin resistance. Metabolic syndrome. People with insulin resistance often have a group of conditions including high blood sugar, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol and triglycerides. Too much glucose from your liver. When your blood sugar is low, your liver makes and sends out glucose. After you eat, your blood sugar goes up, and your liver usually slows down and stores its glucose for later. But some people's livers don't. They keep making sugar. Bad communication between cells. Sometimes, cells send the wrong signals or don't pick up messages correctly. When these problems affect how your cells make and use insulin or glucose, this can lead to diabetes. Broken beta cells. If the cells that make insulin send it out at the wrong time, your blood sugar gets thrown off.

Usually, they’ll test you on 2 different days to confirm the diagnosis. But if your blood glucose is very high or you have many symptoms, one test may be all you need. Blood tests for type 2 diabetes include: A1c. It's an average percent of your blood glucose over the past 2 or 3 months. Fasting plasma glucose. This is also known as a fasting blood sugar test. It measures your blood sugar on an empty stomach. You won't be able to eat or drink anything except water for 8 hours before the test. Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). This checks your blood glucose before and 2 hours after you drink something sweet to see how your body handles the sugar. Learn more about how type 2 diabetes is diagnosed."", 'Stages of Type 2 Diabetes Researchers have defined four stages of type 2 diabetes: Insulin resistance In this stage, your body usually makes enough insulin to keep blood sugar levels in the normal range. But if your cells ""resist"" the insulin (don\'t use it correctly), your body will make more insulin to try to help the glucose get into them. Insulin resistance can be temporary, but it can also last. T here\'s no test to detect insulin resistance , so it can be hard to diagnose.', 'Prediabetes Eventually, insulin resistance causes glucose to build up in your blood. You have prediabetes when your blood sugar levels are higher than normal, but not high enough to be considered diabetes. An A1c between 5.7% and 6.4% means you have prediabetes . You may not have any symptoms.\xa0But prediabetes ups your risk for heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes If your A1c is 6.5% or higher, you have diabetes. You may have symptoms like increased thirst, blurred vision, and numbness in feet or hands. Or you may not have any symptoms at all.', 'Type 2 diabetes with vascular complications At this stage, your diabetes has led to vascular (blood vessel) problems. You may have damage to vessels in your eyes (retinopathy), kidneys ( nephropathy ), and certain nerves (neuropathy). You might also develop heart disease, stroke, or circulation issues.', 'Type 2 Diabetes Treatment Managing type 2 diabetes includes a mix of lifestyle changes and medication. Lifestyle changes You may be able to reach your target blood sugar levels with diet and exercise alone. Weight loss. Dropping extra pounds can help. While losing 5% of your body weight is good, losing at least 7% and keeping it off seems to be ideal. That means someone who weighs 180 pounds can change their blood sugar levels by losing around 13 pounds. Weight loss can seem overwhelming, but portion control and eating healthy foods are a good place to start. Healthy eating. There’s no specific diet for type 2 diabetes. A registered dietitian can teach you about carbs and help you make a meal plan you can stick with. Focus on: Eating fewer calories Cutting back on refined carbs, especially sweets Adding veggies and fruits to your diet Getting more fiber Exercise. Try to get 30 to 60 minutes of physical activity every day. You can walk, bike, swim, or do anything else that gets your heart rate up. Pair that with strength training, like yoga or weightlifting. If you take a medication that lowers your blood sugar, you might need a snack before a workout. Watch your blood sugar levels. Depending on your treatment, especially if you’re on insulin, your doctor will tell you if you need to test your blood sugar levels and how often to do it.', 'Medication If lifestyle changes don’t get you to your target blood sugar levels, you may need medication. Some of the most common for type 2 diabetes include: Metformin (Fortamet, Glucophage, Glumetza, Riomet). This is usually the first medication used to treat type 2 diabetes . It lowers the amount of glucose your liver makes and helps your body respond better to the insulin it does make. Sulfonylureas. This group of drugs helps your body make more insulin. They include glimepiride (Amaryl), glipizide (Glucotrol), and glyburide (DiaBeta, Micronase). Meglitinides. They help your body make more insulin, and they work faster than sulfonylureas. You might take nateglinide (Starlix) or repaglinide (Prandin). Thiazolidinediones. Like metformin, they make you more sensitive to insulin. You could get pioglitazone (Actos) or rosiglitazone (Avandia). But they also raise your risk of heart problems, so they aren’t usually a first choice for treatment. DPP-4 inhibitors. These medications -- linagliptin (Tradjenta), saxagliptin (Onglyza), and sitagliptin (Januvia) -- help lower your blood sugar levels, but they can also cause joint pain and could inflame your pancreas. They work by blocking DPP-4, which is an enzyme that affects the hormone incretin. GLP-1 receptor agonists. You take these medications with a needle to slow digestion and lower blood sugar levels. Some of the most common ones are exenatide (Byetta, Bydureon), liraglutide (Victoza), and semaglutide (Ozempic). SGLT2 inhibitors. These help your kidneys filter out more glucose. You might get bexagliflozin (Brenzavvy), canagliflozin (Invokana), dapagliflozin (Farxiga), or empagliflozin (Jardiance). Empagliflozin has also proven effective in reducing\xa0the risk of hospitalization or death from heart failure. GIP and GLP-1\xa0receptor agonist. Tirzepatide (Mounjaro) is the first in its class and\xa0activates both the GLP-1 and GIP receptors, which leads to improved blood sugar control. Insulin. You might take long-lasting shots at night, such as insulin detemir (Levemir) or insulin glargine (Lantus). Even if you change your lifestyle and take your medicine as directed, your blood sugar may still get worse over time. That doesn’t mean you’ve done something wrong. Diabetes is progressive, and many people eventually need more than one drug.', 'When you take more than one drug to control your type 2 diabetes, that’s called combination therapy. You and your doctor should work together to find the best mix for you. Some drugs control blood sugar spikes (your doctor may call this hyperglycemia ) that come right after meals, for instance. Others are more effective at stopping drops in blood sugar (hypoglycemia) between meals. Some may help with weight loss or cholesterol, as well as your diabetes. You and your doctor should talk about any possible side effects. Cost may be an issue as well. If you take medication for something else, that will need to be factored into any decision. You’ll need to see your doctor more often when you start taking a new combination of drugs. You might find that adding a second drug doesn’t bring your blood sugar under control. Or the combination of two drugs might work only for a short time. If that happens, your doctor might consider a third non-insulin drug, or you may start insulin therapy.', ""Surgeries\xa0for type 2 diabetes Weight loss surgery can effectively treat type 2 diabetes by helping you to lose weight .

That number includes both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Here's what you need to know if your child is diagnosed with type 2."", ""What Is Type 2 Diabetes? You've probably heard diabetes and high blood sugar mentioned together. Here's what happens. Your digestive system breaks down carbohydrates into a type of sugar called glucose. Your pancreas creates a hormone, known as insulin , that moves glucose from your blood into your cells, where it’s used for fuel. In type 2 diabetes , the cells in your child's body don’t respond to the insulin, and glucose builds up in their bloodstream. This is called insulin resistance. Eventually, the sugar levels in their body get too high for it to handle. That could lead to other conditions in the future, like heart disease , blindness, and kidney failure."", ""Who Gets It?

The more they do, the more confident they’ll be. Use your best judgment for what you think your child can handle. Even as they take on more responsibilities, keep an eye on things and give support when needed. At ages 3-7, they can: Choose which finger to use to check blood sugar levels. Pick where to get the insulin shot. Count before taking out the insulin pen or syringe. At ages 8-11, they may: Give themselves insulin while you watch. Notice low blood sugar symptoms and treat themselves. Learn carb counting and start picking some healthy food choices. At age 12 and up, they may: Check blood sugar and take insulin increasingly on their own. Count carbs. Set reminders on when to take pills or check levels. Teen years can bring new challenges. Physical changes during puberty that can make it harder to control blood sugar. Also, weight and body image issues may start to show up. Watch your child for emotional issues, like depression and anxiety , and look out for eating disorders, too. If you have concerns, talk to their doctor. You may want to consider therapy .', ""Tips to Keep Your Child Safe Follow these tips to help keep your child safe and healthy at home and at school: Make sure that your child wears a medical ID bracelet or necklace at all times. This is especially important when they're not with you. Give the school a detailed written plan for how to manage your child’s condition, including how to give insulin injections, meal and snack schedules, and a target blood sugar range. You can create this yourself or use a template called the Diabetes Medical Management Plan. Create a 504 or an Individualized Education Program . These documents take what’s in your child’s diabetes medical plan and spell out the school’s responsibilities. They help keep your child safe and make sure they get the same education and opportunities as everyone else. Make sure your child’s school, coaches, friends’ parents, and others know how to reach you and your child’s doctor in case of emergency. Teach your child, family, and anyone responsible for your child how to notice low blood sugar and what to do about it. Try to keep calm when your child makes mistakes managing diabetes . You need your child to feel comfortable telling you when something’s wrong instead of trying to hide it."", ""Can You Prevent It? The same steps used to treat type 2 diabetes in children can also prevent it. Reduce calories, unhealthy fats, and sweets in your child's diet. Make sure they get physical activity each day. Studies show that exercise has a dramatic effect on reducing insulin resistance. These are two important ways to help your child get down to and stay at a healthy weight and normal blood sugar levels ."", ""Special Concerns Children -- especially teens -- may have a tough time making changes to prevent or manage type 2 diabetes. Here are some ways you can help: Talk with your child honestly about health and weight. Be supportive. Encourage them to speak up about their concerns. Don't separate your child for special treatment. Your entire family can benefit from making changes in diet and activity. Make changes slowly. Just as it took time for diabetes to develop, it will take time to achieve better health. Do more activities your child enjoys. Lower the amount of time your family spends watching TV or playing video games. If your child refuses to follow their plan, try to find out why. Teens, for example, are dealing with hormone changes, demands on their time, peer pressure , and other things that seem more important to them than their health. Set small, easy-to-reach goals. Plan special rewards for your child when they meet each goal. Then move on to the next. Talk to a diabetes educator, doctor, dietitian, or other diabetes professional for more ideas on how to help your child become healthier. By working together, you, your child, and their diabetes health care team can be sure they remain healthy for years to come.""]"
83,What Is Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis?,"['You may know that white blood cells are your body’s infection fighters. But if your body makes too much of a type of immune cell called histiocytes, they can cause tumors, lesions, and other tissue damage. One of these rare disorders -- which resembles some types of cancer -- is called Langerhans cell histiocytosis, or LCH. It most commonly appears in toddlers and very young children, but you can have it as an adult, too.', 'Symptoms LCH can show up on many places on your body, but most often on your skin and bones. It can affect any organ, including your lungs , liver , brain , spleen , or lymph nodes . In about 8 out of 10 people, LCH leads to tumors called granulomas in the skull and in other bones. That can cause pain and swelling, and sometimes it can fracture your arms or legs. LCH symptoms can range from mild to more serious. Some people are born with it, and the disease eventually goes away on its own. But others have a severe and long-lasting type that affects multiple parts of the body.', 'Along with your bones, it can affect your: Skin. Red, scaly bumps in skin folds are common. Infants with LCH can get red, scaly scalps, which is often mistaken for cradle cap , a common skin condition. Liver . Usually, only severe cases of LCH affect the liver. Your skin might appear jaundiced, or yellow, and your blood can take longer to clot. Lymph nodes. These glands, which are behind the ears , in the neck, and in other places, can swell up. You also might have trouble breathing or have coughs .', 'Diagnosis Your doctor will know if you have LCH after a tissue biopsy . That’s when a specialist called a pathologist views the sample under a microscope for specific proteins and other markers of the disease. In addition to the physical exam , your doctors may order other tests based on your symptoms: X-rays of your lungs and bones Bone marrow biopsy to look for signs of LCH Blood chemistry test to check your kidneys , liver , thyroid , and immune system MRIs and PET and CT scans to get detailed images of your body Urinalysis to check levels of red and white cells, protein, and sugar in your pee', 'Causes We don’t know all the reasons why some people get LCH. About half of the people with the disorder have a faulty gene that makes the Langerhans immune cells grow out of control. That genetic mutation happens after birth, which means you usually won’t get LCH from your parents. Researchers suspect that other things may also play a role: Smoking Parents who were exposed to environmental toxins, like benzene or wood dust Infections as a newborn Family history of thyroid disease', 'Treatments As with some types of cancer , doctors sometimes treat LCH with chemotherapy . Many people with the disorder get care from cancer specialists like oncologists and hematologists. But unlike most cancers, limited forms of LCH sometimes spontaneously go away on their own. Beside chemotherapy, options for treatment include: Low-dose radiation to targeted part of the body Surgery to remove LCH lesions Steroids like prednisone or anti-inflammatory drugs Ultraviolet light therapy for skin conditions Stem cell transplant Bone marrow, liver, or lung transplants in very serious cases A great majority of people with LCH recover with treatment. If the disease is in your spleen, liver, or bone marrow, it’s called a high-risk LCH. About 80% of people with that type survive.']"
84,Typhoid Fever (Salmonella Typhi),"[""What Is Typhoid Fever? Typhoid fever (also called enteric fever) is a serious illness caused by infection with the Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi bacteria. A related bacteria called Salmonella serotype Paratyphi causes a similar but milder illness called paratyphoid fever. Both diseases spread through water or food that has been contaminated by the poop or pee of a person who is infected with the germ. You can also get it from uncooked foods, such as raw, unpeeled fruits and unpasteurized milk or juice. Some people with typhoid fever get a flat rash called rose spots. In people with a light skin tone, the spots appear rose-colored or warm pink. (Photo Credit: Mike Devlin/Science Source) Typhoid fever used to be very common throughout the world, but now it's rare in countries such as the U.S., Canada, Japan, Western Europe, and Australia because human waste disposal is managed and water is treated to kill germs. However, other areas still have high levels of typhoid. It's more common in parts of South and Southeast Asia, Central and South America, Africa, and the Caribbean. It sickens up to 21 million people around the world each year. Children are more likely to get it than adults."", ""Typhoid fever vs. typhus These diseases sound similar, and that's because they are. They have similar symptoms, and people used to think they were the same thing. But now that we have modern tools, we know that they're caused by two different types of salmonella bacteria. In the U.S., people most often get typhus from fleas that are infected by biting rats and opossums, whereas typhoid fever mostly spreads through contaminated food."", ""Typhoid Fever Causes People who have typhoid fever release the germ in their pee and poop. If they don’t wash their hands well after going to the bathroom, the germ stays on their hands. It then spreads to other things, including water and food. The bacteria can survive for weeks in water or dried sewage. If you drink or\xa0eat contaminated water or food, the bacteria will enter your body. This is generally how you get sick. However, you can (rarely) get it from close contact with a sick person or someone who is a carrier. A carrier is a person who still has the bacteria in their body, even when they don't look or feel sick and they've taken antibiotics. They can still spread the illness, and this can last up to a year or longer after recovery. Even if you're feeling better, you need to be tested for Salmonella Typhi to make sure you can't spread it."", ""Typhoid Fever Diagnosis Your doctor may suspect you have typhoid fever based on your symptoms and your medical and travel history. Make sure you tell your doctor if you've traveled recently, or if you think you've been exposed to typhoid fever. To check that you have it, your doctor will do lab tests to look for the bacteria that causes it in a sample of your body fluid or tissue. Your doctor may also do other tests to look for complications, such as: X-rays to look for changes in your lungs EKG Ultrasound Liver enzymes and function tests Test for typhoid fever The most common test your doctor will do is a tissue culture. To do that, your doctor may take tissue samples, such as your: Blood (most often) Poop Skin, especially if you have rose spots Bone marrow Pee (rarely) After they take the sample, technicians will put it in a warm place to let the bacteria grow. Then, they’ll look at it through a microscope to see if there’s any\xa0salmonella bacteria in it. Your doctor may also confirm the infection by testing your blood for antibodies against typhoid bacteria (called a Widal test) or DNA from the bacteria in your blood. Antibodies are proteins your immune system makes that attach to foreign invaders like bacteria so they can be killed."", 'Typhoid Fever Symptoms After you come in contact with the germ that causes typhoid fever, it may take a while for you to get sick. Your symptoms usually show up in 1-3 weeks. At first, you may get: Fever that can be as high as 103-104 F and may rise one night, fall the next morning, and then continue to rise and fall Headaches Chills Weakness and fatigue Muscle aches Sweating Cough Loss of appetite Diarrhea or constipation A rash of flat, warm pink spots, usually on your chest or stomach A few weeks after your symptoms start, you may also get severe stomach swelling and pain or an infection called sepsis, affecting the entire body. In serious cases, you may get life-threatening complications, such as: Confusion Inability to pay attention Inability to respond', 'If you have any of the following symptoms, you should go to the ER right away: High fever Brain symptoms, such as confusion or seizures Coughing up or vomiting blood Serious stomach pain Bloody or tarry (dark, thick, and sticky) poop', 'Typhoid fever rash Typhoid fever sometimes causes a rash called ""rose spots."" About 30% of people who get infected with Salmonella Typhi get rose spots. In people with light skin tones, rose spots usually appear as groups of 5-15 warm pink spots about the size of a grain of rice or slightly smaller. They tend to last about 3-5 days and are usually on your chest or stomach, but they may also appear on your back, arms, and legs.', ""Typhoid Fever Treatment Antibiotics are the only way of treating typhoid fever. Most people who start antibiotics soon after getting sick start to feel better in a few days, but you will likely need 7-10 days to recover fully. If you are very ill or have complications such as vomiting, diarrhea, or swelling in your belly or brain, you may get additional treatments, such as steroids. You may also need to go to the hospital, especially if you're dehydrated or need help breathing."", 'Some people who have serious intestinal complications, such as peritonitis or ileal perforation, may need to have surgery to repair these. Peritonitis is when one of the tissues in your stomach gets infected, usually due to a hole in your stomach or colon. Ileal perforation is when you get a hole in the last part of your small intestine (called the ileum). People who are carriers may need surgery to remove their gallbladder because the S. Typhi bacteria hide out there, and the organ\'s removal can cure the infection. Typhoid fever medication The S. Typhi bacteria in different areas may have slightly different versions (these are called ""strains""). So, the bacteria you\'re infected with may or may not respond to certain antibiotics. This is why you must tell your doctor where you\'ve been traveling. This information will help your doctor pick the right antibiotic for you. They may also prescribe a combination of antibiotics.', 'Some of the antibiotics that your doctor may use include: Carbapenems Cephalosporins, such as ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, or cefixime Fluoroquinolones, such as ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, or ofloxacin (these are the most often used) Macrolides, such as azithromycin', 'Some bacteria have developed antibiotic resistance, which means that only a few antibiotics work on them. If you get one of these strains, typhoid fever can be very hard to treat and may result in long-term health problems, which can be life-threatening. Your doctor may do extra tests to see which antibiotics will work on your infection. To help prevent antibiotic resistance, make sure you complete the entire course of antibiotics as directed by your doctor. Because of the chance of exposure to antibiotic-resistant strains of S. Typhi , make sure you get vaccinated before you travel. Also, practice good hygiene, especially in regions that have high rates of typhoid fever. Typhoid fever diet No diet can treat typhoid fever, but you can ease some of your symptoms by choosing easy-to-digest foods that give you a lot of nutrients, including: Cooked vegetables (avoid raw vegetables) Canned or fresh fruit, such as ripe bananas, applesauce, or melon Refined grains, such as white rice, pasta, and white bread (avoid whole grains until you feel better) Proteins such as eggs, chicken, turkey, fish, tofu, or ground meat Low-fat or fat-free milk, yogurt, and cheese Make sure you drink plenty of water. And avoid spicy foods and those with high fiber and fat content (such as pastries, potato chips, nuts, seeds, and beans). These foods can be hard to digest and worsen some of your symptoms.', ""Is Typhoid Fever Contagious? Yes, it's generally spread through food or water contaminated with the S. Typhi bacteria. Food and water can get contaminated when someone with typhoid fever touches your food or water without washing their hands. Sometimes, it spreads when water that has poop or pee in it gets into the food you eat or the water you drink or use to rinse food you eat raw. This might happen when there's a natural disaster in your area, such as a flood or earthquake."", ""You usually don't get it from direct contact with another person (for instance, you can't get it from kissing someone), but you can get it from touching something they've touched (such as a doorknob) after going to the bathroom and not washing their hands. Typhoid fever prevention You’re more likely to get typhoid fever in places where it's common, including parts of South and Southeast Asia, Central and South America, Africa, and the Caribbean. If you travel to one of these places, you should take extra precautions to stay safe. To avoid getting typhoid fever, you should: Wash your hands often with warm soap and water. Do this especially before you make or eat food and after you go to the bathroom. If warm soap and water aren't available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. And don't make food for other people if you're sick because you might accidentally contaminate their food. Even after you feel better, talk to your doctor about whether you could still be contagious. You can get tested to make sure you’re not a carrier of the bacteria. Avoid raw fruits and vegetables. If you do eat them, peel them first or wash them with bottled water. Wash cooking surfaces and utensils, preferably with bottled water, before and after you use them. Eat packaged or fresh, hot food. These are the safest options when you're not sure if your food is contaminated. Drink only bottled or canned liquids. Use bottled water to brush your teeth. Avoid ice cubes because they may have been made with contaminated water. Also, avoid unpasteurized juice and milk. Get vaccinated before you travel. Vaccines are about 50%-80% effective in preventing an S. Typhi infection. Since the vaccine isn't 100% effective, you should still take care to avoid exposure to the bacteria. Plan for medical care before you travel. The CDC has a web page on getting health care while traveling, which includes a list of recommendations for making a plan before you travel and a list of resources for international travelers. For instance, if you are a U.S. citizen, you can call the local consulate or embassy, and they can help you find doctors in your area."", ""Signs of Recovery From Typhoid If you start antibiotics soon after you get sick, you can expect to feel better about a week after starting the right one. Signs that you're getting better include: No fever Improved appetite Reduced diarrhea No body pain Improved energy No chest congestion People who don't get treatment right away may take weeks before they start to feel better. This also puts them at a higher risk of getting complications, which could further extend their recovery time. Some people get sick again after they recover. This is called a relapse and is usually a milder case than the first time. If it happens, it's usually about a week after you finish your antibiotics, but it can also happen weeks or months later. In this case, call your doctor because you will likely need more antibiotics. About 5% of people who have recovered from typhoid fever are carriers. This means that even though you look and feel fine, you can still pass the bacteria in your pee in poop. This can last a year or even longer. Your doctor can test to see if you still carry the S. Typhi bacteria. In some places, you may need to have a negative test before you can go back to work or school."", ""Typhoid Fever Complications In the later stages, typhoid fever can damage the walls of your intestines. When your intestinal walls are weakened, partially digested food can leak out of your intestine and spread throughout your body. This can lead to a dangerous infection called sepsis. If you’re sick with typhoid fever and have severe stomach pain and nausea, or any signs of sepsis, call 911 or go to the ER right away. Signs and symptoms of sepsis include: A change in your mental status, such as delirium, hallucinations, or confusion Seizures Feeling dizzy or light-headed Fast, shallow breathing Sweating when you don't know why Shivering If you don't get treatment for typhoid fever, you can get serious complications, including: Internal bleeding Holes in your intestines Swollen or burst gallbladder Inflammation of your heart (myocarditis) or the lining of your heart and heart valves (endocarditis) Infection in your major blood vessels (mycotic aneurysm) Inflammation of your pancreas (pancreatitis) Inflammation of the membranes and fluid in your brain and spinal cord (meningitis) Inflammation of your bones (osteomyelitis) Pneumonia or bronchitis Kidney or bladder infection Miscarriage in pregnant people"", ""Typhoid Fever Vaccine Two vaccines are currently available in the U.S. to prevent typhoid fever: Oral vaccine. This is available for people who are at least 6 years old. It comes as four pills that you take every other day, and you need to finish it at least 1 week before you travel. You'll need a booster for this every 5 years. Injectable vaccine. This is available for people who are at least 2 years old. For this vaccine to be effective, you need to get it at least 2 weeks before you travel. You'll need a booster every 2 years. These vaccines lower your chance of getting sick, but they don’t guarantee that you won’t get it. So, even if you're vaccinated, practice good hygiene by washing your hands often, and use good food safety habits."", ""Takeaways Typhoid fever is a serious infection. You get it by eating or drinking something that's contaminated with Salmonella Typhi\xa0bacteria.\xa0If you think you have typhoid fever, call a doctor right away. Antibiotics are the only treatment for typhoid fever. You need to start treatment as soon as possible after you get sick to prevent potentially life-threatening complications and a long recovery."", 'Typhoid Fever FAQs Does typhoid fever ever go away? Most of the time, typhoid fever goes away when you take antibiotics. The earlier you start treatment, the sooner you will get better. However, about 5% of people will still be contagious after they have recovered. These people are called carriers. Some carriers need to have their gallbladder removed to fully get rid of the bacteria. What is the survival rate of typhoid fever? Most people (about 70%-88%) recover from typhoid fever. Of course, your chance of a full recovery is better when you get treatment with antibiotics as soon as possible after getting sick. If you wait to get treatment, it can increase your chance of getting life-threatening complications, preventing complete recovery.']"
