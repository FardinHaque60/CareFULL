0,What Is Kava Kava?,"Kava Kava is an herbal remedy that's made from the roots of Piper methysticum -- a type of plant found in the islands of the Pacific Ocean. Its name literally means “intoxicating pepper.” People who live on Pacific islands like Fiji and Tonga have used it for hundreds of years in social gatherings and traditional medicine. They dry out the roots or crush them into a powder. Then they add water and drink the mixture. How’s It Used? Kava kava (“kava” for short) contains substances called kavapyrones. They act much like alcohol on your brain , making you feel calm, relaxed, and happy. The plant is also thought to relieve pain , prevent seizures , and relax muscles. You can buy it as an herbal supplement online and in health food stores. It's available in capsules, tablets, or tinctures (that means it’s dissolved in alcohol ). Kava has been used to treat a number of conditions, including: Anxiety -- including generalized anxiety disorder ( GAD ) Stress Trouble sleeping Premenstrual syndrome ( PMS ) -- the physical and emotional symptoms that come before a woman's period Is it Safe? Doctors aren’t sure how much kava you can take safely. If your doctor gives you the okay, use the smallest possible dose. Don't take it for longer than 3 months, and avoid drinking alcohol while you’re using it. Kava can have side effects. The most common are: Headaches Dizziness Fatigue Depression Diarrhea Skin problems Dry, scaly, or yellow skin (in people who use large amounts) The most serious concern stems from reports of liver damage in a few people who took kava. In 2002, the FDA released a consumer advisory that warned about the risk of liver disease with the supplements . The herb was linked to cirrhosis ( liver scarring), hepatitis (irritation of the liver), and liver failure (this led to a liver transplant or death in a few patients). It's not clear whether kava caused the liver damage, or if other medications or herbs the people took caused it. Most of the time, the damage improved within a few months after they stopped taking the kava. A few countries, including France and Canada, have banned kava because of the risk it poses to the liver. But you can still buy it in the U.S. and online. It might also be addictive, but this hasn't been proven. Before You Use It Talk to your doctor if you’re thinking about taking kava. Tell them about all the medicines you take. This herb can interact with some medications, including: Antiretroviral medicines used to treat HIV / AIDS Benzodiazepines and barbiturates that treat anxiety Medications used to treat Parkinson's disease . Don't use kava if you have liver disease, are pregnant or breastfeeding , or have depression or bipolar disorder . When to Call Your Doctor Make an appointment if you take kava and have any of the following signs of liver damage: Tiredness Nausea , vomiting Yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes ( jaundice ) Stomach pain Loss of appetite"
1,Kawasaki Disease: Symptoms and Treatment,"What Is Kawasaki Disease? Kawasaki disease is an illness that causes blood vessels to become inflamed, almost always in young children. It's one of the leading causes of heart disease in kids. But doctors can treat it if they find it early. Most children get better without any problems. Kawasaki disease usually happens in young children. It can cause your blood vessels to inflame. It's treatable if doctors find it early, and most kids get better without any issues. (Photo Credit: ISM/Science Source) Kawasaki Disease Causes and Risk Factors The inflammation of Kawasaki disease can damage a child's coronary arteries, which carry blood to their heart. It can also cause problems with lymph nodes, skin, and the lining of a child's mouth, nose, and throat. Scientists haven't found an exact cause of Kawasaki disease. It might be linked to genes, viruses, bacteria , and other things in the world around a child, such as chemicals and irritants. The disease probably isn't contagious, but it sometimes happens in clusters in a community. Kids are more likely to get it in the winter and spring. Other things can raise a child's odds of getting Kawasaki disease, including: Age. It usually affects children who are 5 years or younger. Sex. Boys are 1.5 times more likely to get it than girls. Ethnicity. Children of Asian and Pacific Island descent are more likely to have Kawasaki disease. Research shows Black children with Kawasaki disease may have different symptoms and respond differently to treatment than White children . One study found this group of kids had more serious inflammation, worse treatment outcomes and more secondary treatments and spent longer in the hospital than White kids. Kawasaki Disease Symptoms Kawasaki disease comes on fast, and symptoms show up in phases. Signs of the first phase of Kawasaki disease include: High fever (above 101 F) that lasts more than 5 days; it won't go down even if a child takes medication that usually works on fever Rash, often between the chest and legs and in the genital or groin area Peeling skin on the fingers and toes (usually in weeks two or three of the illness) Swelling and redness in hands and bottoms of feet Red eyes Swollen glands, especially in the neck Irritated throat, mouth, and lips Swollen, bright red ""strawberry tongue"" In the second phase, symptoms include: Joint pain Belly pain Stomach trouble, such as diarrhea and vomiting Peeling skin on hands and feet Kawasaki disease can cause heart trouble 10 days to 2 weeks after symptoms start. Symptoms tend to go away slowly in the third phase. It might last as long as 8 weeks. Call your doctor if your child has these symptoms, including a fever between 101 F and 103 F that lasts more than 4 days. Early treatment can help lower their risk of lasting effects. Kawasaki disease rash If your child has Kawasaki disease, you'll probably notice a rash in their genital area or in the area between their chest and legs. It's likely to disappear in a week. It's often flat and blotchy but can also have raised bumps. While the rash may look red on light skin, it can be harder to see on darker skin tones. Kawasaki Disease Diagnosis Your doctor will do a physical exam and ask about your child's symptoms. They'll look for a long-lasting fever and at least four of these five signs: Red eyes Dry, cracked, very red lips and a redder-than-normal swollen tongue Rash Swollen lymph nodes Swollen, discolored skin on your palms and bottom of your feet They may need to do tests to rule out other illnesses or to see whether the condition has affected your child's heart. These include: Heart tests such as electrocardiogram (EKG) and echocardiogram Blood tests Imaging tests like X-rays and coronary angiogram Kawasaki disease and COVID-19 Kids who get COVID-19 can also end up with a condition called multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C). The symptoms of MIS-C such as fever and rash look a lot like the ones of Kawasaki disease. Talk to your child's doctor about any concerning symptoms. Kawasaki Disease Treatment Your child may have a lot of pain from the fever, swelling, and skin problems. Their doctor might prescribe medicine to make them feel better, such as aspirin and drugs that prevent blood clots. Don't give your child any drugs without talking to your doctor first. The doctor will probably also give them immunoglobulin into a vein (intravenous or IV). This has proteins called antibodies to help fight infection. It will lower a child's chance of heart issues when they get it early on in treatment. Most children start treatment for Kawasaki disease in a hospital because there's a high chance it will cause serious health problems . After their first treatment, your child may continue to take low-dose aspirin for 6 weeks or more, especially if the artery supplying oxygen-infused blood to their heart widens (called coronary artery aneurysm). Aspirin stops their blood from clotting. Your child's doctor will likely schedule several follow-up visits to check for signs of heart problems. If they do show signs, your child could need heart health tests and to visit a heart disease specialist. Kawasaki Disease Complications Because it involves a child's heart, this illness can be scary. But most kids recover completely and have no lasting problems. In rare cases, children can have: Unusual heart rhythms (dysrhythmia) Inflamed heart muscles (myocarditis) Damaged heart valves (mitral regurgitation) Inflamed blood vessels (vasculitis) These can lead to other troubles, including weak or bulging artery walls. These are called aneurysms. They could raise a child's risk of artery blockages, which can cause internal bleeding and heart attacks. An echocardiogram can show many of these complications. In severe cases, a child might need surgery. Infants have a higher risk of other serious health problems. In the U.S., fewer than 1% of children die during the early illness. Kawasaki Disease Outlook With treatment, most kids with Kawasaki disease can avoid heart disease and death. Coronary artery aneurysms impact just 6% of kids who've been treated for the condition, and 50% of children with coronary artery problems heal in 1 or 2 years with treatment. Without treatment, heart problems from Kawasaki disease can cause death in 45 days or less after a fever starts."
2,What Is Keratoconus?,"Normally your cornea, the clear outer lens or ""windshield"" of the eye , has a dome shape, like a ball. Sometimes the structure isn’t strong enough to hold its round shape and it bulges outward, like a cone. This is called keratoconus . Tiny fibers of protein in your eye called collagen help hold your cornea in place. When these fibers get weak, they can’t hold their shape. Your cornea gets more and more cone-like. It happens when you don’t have enough protective antioxidants in your cornea. Its cells produce harmful byproducts, the same way a car puts out exhaust. Normally, antioxidants get rid of them and protect the collagen fibers. But if levels are low, the collagen weakens and the cornea bulges. What Causes It? We don’t know exactly what causes keratoconus. Researchers think that some people are more likely to get it from birth. Several things may have a link to the condition: Family history : If someone in your family has this condition, you have a greater chance of getting it yourself. If you have it, get your children’s eyes checked for signs starting around age 10. Age: It usually starts when you’re a teenager. But it might show up earlier in childhood or not until you’re 30. It can also affect people 40 and older, but that’s less common. Certain disorders: Studies have found a connection between keratoconus and systemic conditions such as Down syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, osteogenesis imperfecta, and retinitis pigmentosa . Inflammation : Inflammation from things like allergies , asthma , or atopic eye disease can break down the tissue of the cornea. Eye rubbing: Rubbing your eyes hard over time can break down the cornea. It can also make keratoconus progress faster if you already have it. Race: One study of more than 16,000 people with keratoconus found that people who are Black or Latino are roughly 50% more likely to get it than people who are white. Can It Damage Vision? Changes to the cornea can make it impossible for your eye to focus without glasses or contact lenses . In fact, you may need a corneal transplant to restore your sight if the condition gets bad enough. Laser vision correction surgery -- LASIK -- is dangerous if you have keratoconus. It can weaken your cornea more and make your vision worse. Even if you have only a small degree of keratoconus, don’t get LASIK surgery. What Are the Symptoms? Keratoconus changes your vision in two ways: As the cornea changes shape from a ball to a cone, the smooth surface becomes wavy. This is called irregular astigmatism . As the front expands, your vision becomes more nearsighted . That means you can see objects clearly only when they’re up close. Anything too far away looks like a blur. An eye doctor may spot the signs during an eye exam . You should also mention symptoms like: Double vision when looking with just one eye Objects both near and far that look blurry Bright lights that appear to have halos around them Light streaks Triple ghost images Blurry vision that makes it hard to drive How Is It Diagnosed? Your doctor needs to measure the shape of your cornea. There are different ways, but the most common is called corneal topography. The doctor snaps a photo of your cornea and checks it closely. Children of parents with keratoconus should have one every year starting at age 10. How Is It Treated? You’ll probably start with new glasses. If you have a mild case, new eyeglasses should clear things up. If they don't, your doctor will suggest contact lenses. Rigid gas permeable contacts are usually the first choice. Over time, you may need other treatments to strengthen your cornea and improve your sight. A treatment called cornea collagen crosslinking may stop the condition from getting worse. Or your doctor could implant a ring called an Intacs under the cornea’s surface to flatten the cone shape and improve vision. When other treatments don’t give you good vision, the last resort is a cornea transplant . This is a very safe operation, and it’s successful in more than 90% of cases. The doctor will remove the center of your cornea, replace it with one from a donor, and stitch the new one into place. You may need contact lenses afterward."
3,Kegel Exercises,"What Are Kegel Exercises? Kegel exercises are exercises to strengthen your pelvic floor muscles. You might also hear them called pelvic floor exercises. They affect the muscles that support your uterus, bladder, small intestine, and rectum. Kegels don’t just help keep them fit, they can help you avoid bladder leaks and passing gas or stool by accident. They can even improve your orgasms. Benefits of Kegel Exercise When they’re working like they should, your pelvic floor muscles may never cross your mind. But as you age, they can start to weaken. This puts you at risk for a condition doctors call pelvic organ prolapse (POP). Basically, your pelvic organs start to droop. They can fall into or out of your vagina. If you’ve had a hysterectomy, your vaginal tissues can start to come out of your body. Other things that put you at risk for POP include: Pregnancy Giving birth through the vagina Surgery in the pelvic area (C-section or hysterectomy ) Genetics Frequent coughing, laughing, or sneezing (it pushes on the pelvic organs) Kegel exercises aren’t just for women. They can strengthen men’s pelvic floor muscles, too. These muscles support your bladder and bowel and affect sexual function. Kegels can help if you have trouble with bladder or bowel incontinence, or if you dribble after you pee. They can make sex better by giving you more feeling during an orgasm and greater control over ejaculation. How to Do Kegel Exercises Try to pee. Once urine starts to flow, squeeze your muscles to hold it in. You should feel the muscles lift. Another way is to squeeze the muscles that stop you from passing gas. You just did one Kegel. Relax the muscle and do it again. Don’t get into the habit of doing Kegels while you pee, though. This can cause other problems, like urinary tract infections. Start slowly. Try squeezing your pelvic floor muscles for 3 seconds, then release for 3 seconds. Do this 10 times in a row. That’s one set. If you can’t do 10, do as many as you can and build up over time. Try to work up to one set of 10 Kegels two to three times a day. Kegels aren’t harmful. In fact, you can make them a part of your daily routine. Do them while you’re brushing your teeth , driving to work, eating dinner, or watching TV. When to See Your Doctor Ask for help if you’re having trouble doing Kegels. The doctor can give you tips on how to do them the right way. There are also tools that can help, like: Vaginal cones. Women can insert these weights into the vagina and hold in place with pelvic muscle contractions. Biofeedback . For both men and women, your doctor will insert a pressure sensor into the rectum or vagina. As you squeeze and relax your pelvic floor muscles, a monitor measures activity. Kegel Exercise Results Most women who do Kegels regularly see results, like fewer urine leaks, within a few weeks or months. If you’re still concerned about a prolapse or don’t feel your symptoms are getting better, talk to your doctor about other treatments. Kegel Complications Kegels are safe, but it’s still important to be careful. Here’s what to watch out for: Don’t do Kegels while you pee. The idea is to tighten your muscles like you’re trying to stop peeing, but not to actually do it. There’s a chance that you could get a urinary tract infection (UTI). Don’t overdo it. This could lead to straining when you use the bathroom. Exercise regularly. Just like with other types of exercise, Kegels take practice to get stronger. You’ll need to do them every day for at least 15 weeks. Talk to your doctor about any changes to your routine. Kegels aren’t for everyone. If your pelvic floor muscles are always tight, these exercises can do more harm than good. If you try to contract muscles that are already tired, they won’t be able to respond. Your doctor can help you figure out if this applies to you."
4,Seborrheic Dermatitis,"What Is Seborrheic Dermatitis? Seborrheic dermatitis is a common skin disease that causes an itchy rash with flaky scales. It causes redness on light skin and light patches on darker skin. It’s also called dandruff, cradle cap, seborrhea, seborrheic eczema, and seborrheic psoriasis. Seborrheic dermatitis is a skin disease that can cause a rash anywhere on your body. (Photo credit: istock/Getty Images) It might look similar to psoriasis, eczema, or an allergic reaction. It usually happens on your scalp, but you can get it anywhere on your body. Seborrheic dermatitis vs. dandruff Seborrheic dermatitis and dandruff both cause scales that be itchy and either dry or greasy. Dandruff may be considered the mildest form of seborrheic dermatitis. Both conditions can be treated the same way, but your doctor may suggest additional treatments if you have seborrheic dermatitis. Unlike seborrheic dermatitis, dandruff happens only on your scalp. Another difference is that seborrheic dermatitis causes swelling and discolored skin, but dandruff doesn't. Scalp psoriasis vs. scalp seborrheic dermatitis Both are common conditions that can affect your scalp . They share some symptoms, such as inflamed, scaly skin. Scalp psoriasis has patches of thicker and drier scales, while scalp seborrheic dermatitis has skin flakes. Your doctor can tell which condition you have by looking at your skin, scalp, and nails. Treatments for both include medicated shampoos and corticosteroid lotions. Scalp psoriasis, which is more persistent and difficult to treat than seborrheic dermatitis, may also require other treatments like light therapy. Seborrheic Dermatitis Causes Seborrheic dermatitis may be due to the yeast Malassezia, excess oil in your skin, or issues with your immune system. It doesn't come from an allergy or from being unclean. It's not contagious. But e xperts don't know what exactly causes it. Some seborrheic dermatitis triggers include: Stress Fatigue Change of seasons, or weather that's cold and dry Certain medical conditions and medicines Seborrheic Dermatitis Risk Factors Newborns and adults ages 30 to 60 are most likely to get seborrheic dermatitis. It's more common in men than women and in people with oily skin. These conditions can also raise your risk: Acne Alcoholism Having a mental health condition such as d epression Immune system disorders such as HIV infection Being an organ transplant recipient Recovery from a stressful medical condition like a heart attack or stroke Nervous system conditions such as Parkinson's disease Seborrheic Dermatitis Symptoms Your symptoms may include: Flaking skin Flakes of skin in your mustache or beard Patches of greasy skin covered with flaky white or yellow scales or crust A rash that may look darker or lighter in people with brown or Black skin -- and redder in those with white skin Ring-shaped (annular) rash (this is called petaloid seborrheic dermatitis) Itchiness (pruritus) Seborrheic dermatitis can look like other skin conditions. See your doctor to get a diagnosis and a treatment plan. Locations of seborrheic dermatitis Babies 3 months and younger often get cradle cap: crusty yellow or brown scales on their scalp. It usually goes away before they're a year old, although it can come back when they reach puberty . Parents might mistake seborrheic dermatitis for diaper rash. As an adult, you can get seborrheic dermatitis on your face, especially around your nose, in your eyebrows, on your eyelids, or behind your ears . You might develop it on your skin under your beard or mustache. It can show up on other parts of your body, too: In the middle part of your chest Around your navel On your buttocks In skin folds under your arms and on your legs In your groin Below your breasts Seborrheic Dermatitis Diagnosis Your doctor will ask about your medical history and look at your skin. They might scrape off a bit of skin and look at it under a microscope to rule out conditions that affect your skin, including: Psoriasis . This causes a lot of silvery white scales, often on your elbows and knees. It can also change how your fingernails look. You might have this at the same time as seborrheic dermatitis. Eczema (atopic dermatitis). This usually causes inflamed skin on your head, elbows, or knees. Rosacea. This can also happen along with dermatitis. It causes a red rash with few or no scales, often on your face. Rosacea can go away and come back several times. Allergic reaction. If your rash is itchy and doesn’t clear up with treatment, an allergy could be causing it. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Some stages of this condition can cause a butterfly-shaped rash across the middle of your face. Seborrheic Dermatitis Treatment Seborrheic dermatitis will sometimes clear up by itself. But often, it's a lifelong issue that clears and flares. You can usually control it with good skin care. Talk with your doctor about a treatment plan. They’ll probably tell you to start with over-the-counter medicines and home remedies. If you have seborrheic dermatitis on your scalp, use an over-the-counter dandruff shampoo with one of these ingredients: Coal tar Ketoconazole Salicylic acid Selenium sulfide Zinc pyrithione If your baby has cradle cap, shampoo their scalp daily with warm water and baby shampoo. A dandruff shampoo could irritate their skin, so talk to your pediatrician about medicated shampoos before you try one. To soften thick patches, rub mineral oil onto the area and brush gently with a baby hairbrush to help peel the scales off. If you have seborrheic dermatitis on your face and body, keep the affected areas clean. Wash with soap and water every day. Sunlight may stop the growth of the yeast organisms that are causing the problem, so being outdoors could help make the rash go away. Make sure to wear sunscreen. Other treatments include: Antifungal products Corticosteroid lotions Sulfur products These medicines can have side effects, especially if you use them for a long time. Seborrheic dermatitis shampoo. Your doctor might suggest you use a medicated shampoo with 2% ketoconazole or 1% ciclopirox (Loprox). But be aware that ketoconazole can make your hair more dry if it's tightly coiled or chemically treated. In that case, use the shampoo no more than once a week and use a moisturizing conditioner. You can use other medicated shampoos once a day, or two to three times a week, for several weeks. Let it sit on your scalp for a few minutes before rinsing. When your symptoms go away, you can use it every week or two to help prevent a relapse. Whatever treatments you use, follow your doctor’s advice. The best results often come from a mix of treatments . Contact your doctor if your affected areas: Don't get better Become painful, red, or swollen Start draining pus Can seborrheic dermatitis heal on its own? For babies, seborrheic dermatitis (cradle cap) goes away on its own within a few months . For teens and adults,  it might go away on its own, but you'll likely need treatment. It's possible to have flares of seborrheic dermatitis throughout your life. Seborrheic Dermatitis Complications Complications from seborrheic dermatitis are very rare. In some cases, you might develop secondary bacterial infections in areas of your body affected by this skin disease. These include eyelids in adults and diaper areas in babies. You might have some hair loss, but that's caused by itching and rubbing your scalp and other areas affected by seborrheic dermatitis, not by the condition itself. Intense itching can damage your hair follicles , which can interrupt your natural hair growth and cause your hair to fall out. Seborrheic Dermatitis Home Remedies Lifestyle changes and home remedies may help you control seborrheic dermatitis. Your best treatment depends on your skin type, grooming practices, and symptoms. But before using dietary supplements or other alternative therapies, talk with your doctor. Some home remedies you might try are: Use oil to remove scales. Use mineral oil, peanut oil, or olive oil on your scalp for 1 to 3 hours. Then comb or brush your hair and wash it. Wash your skin. Use warm, not hot, water and a gentle soap or non-soap cleanser. Rinse thoroughly. Pat dry and apply a moisturizer while your skin is still damp. Avoid hair-styling products. Don't use hair sprays, gels, or other styling products. Avoid skin and hair products with alcohol . These can make your condition worse. Clean your eyelids. If your eyelids are scaly, wash them daily. Mix a few drops of baby shampoo with two capfuls of warm water. Wipe away scales with a cotton swab. Warm, damp cloths pressed to your eyelids also may help. Use aloe. Apply aloe gel to your affected area. You can choose a skin product that contains aloe or use aloe directly from the leaf of an aloe plant.

5,What Is Kernicterus?,"Kernicterus is a rare kind of preventable brain damage that can happen in newborns with jaundice . Jaundice is a yellow coloring of the skin and other tissues that affects about 60%-80% of infants in the United States. It happens when babies build up too much of a chemical called bilirubin in their blood . Normally, this condition goes away on its own. It’s only when the bilirubin level stays too high and isn’t treated that jaundice becomes kernicterus and causes brain damage. That is called bilirubin-induced neurologic dysfunction, or BIND. Symptoms When your baby develops jaundice, the change in skin tone usually is seen in their face first. As the bilirubin level gets higher, the symptoms can move to the rest of their body, including their chest, abdomen , arms, and legs. It’s harder to see in babies with darker skin. It can also show up in the whites of your baby ’s eyes . If your baby has any of the symptoms of jaundice, it’s important to see the doctor immediately. Changes in skin color, causing a yellow or orange tint starting at their head Difficulty waking up or trouble sleeping at all Problems feeding, either from the breast or bottle Extreme fussiness Fewer than average wet or dirty diapers Most cases of jaundice don’t require treatment, but if it goes on too long, complications can occur and it can lead to kernicterus. Symptoms of kernicterus can vary, but may include: Drowsiness or lack of energy Uncontrollable or very high-pitched/shrill crying Fever Trouble feeding Limpness or stiffness of the whole body Unusual eye movements Muscle spasms or reduced muscle tone Other symptoms of kernicterus can develop as a child gets older: Seizures or convulsions Unusual motor development and movement Muscle spasms and/or writhing Hearing and other sensory problems Inability to gaze upward Stained tooth enamel Diagnosis and Tests Babies usually have their highest bilirubin level when they’re 3 to 5 days old. Newborns should be watched for jaundice every 8 to 12 hours during the first 2 days of their lives. They should then be rechecked before they’re 5 days old. Doctors can test the bilirubin level of your newborn with a light meter before they leave the hospital. If the result is high, the doctor can order a blood test for further evaluation. A blood test is the most accurate way to measure bilirubin levels. If your baby’s bilirubin level is too high, they’ll receive specific treatments depending on how many hours old they are and whether they have certain risk factors. The doctor may order more blood tests after treatment to make sure the level is going back toward a normal range. Treatment Mild jaundice may not require treatment, but if their bilirubin level is high, or if your baby has certain risk factors (like being born prematurely), treatment may be necessary. The options may include: Providing enough breast milk and/or formula . If your baby isn’t getting enough fluids, they may not be getting rid of enough of the yellow pigment of jaundice through their urine and stool. Newborns should have at least six wet diapers a day, and their stool should change from dark green to yellow if they’re starting to get enough nutrition . They should also seem satisfied when they’ve had enough to eat. Phototherapy ( light therapy ). This involves using a special blue light on a baby’s skin in the hospital or at home to break down bilirubin. This makes it easier for a baby’s body to pass it. At one time, experts thought sunlight could help treat jaundice, but it’s no longer recommended because it can lead to sunburn. Phototherapy is considered very safe, although it may cause some temporary side effects like a loose stool and a rash . Fluids. It is important for newborns to get enough fluids during phototherapy. Breast or bottle feeding should continue. If a baby is severely dehydrated, IV fluids may be needed. Blood transfusion . This is done if a baby isn’t responding to other treatments and it’s necessary to quickly lower their bilirubin level. It’s only done if a baby is showing signs of brain damage from too much bilirubin."
6,Chronic Kidney Disease,"If you have chronic kidney disease (CKD), it’s important to watch what you eat and drink. That’s because your kidneys can’t remove waste products and fluid from your body the way they should. A kidney-friendly diet can help you stay healthier longer. What’s a Kidney-Friendly Diet? A major function of the kidneys is to get rid of waste and extra fluid from your body through your pee. They also: Balance your body’s minerals , like salt and potassium Balance your body’s fluids Make hormones that affect the way other organs work A kidney-friendly diet is a way of eating that helps protect your kidneys from further damage. You’ll have to limit some foods and fluids so other fluids and minerals like electrolytes don’t build up in your body. At the same time, you’ll have to make sure you get the right balance of protein, calories, vitamins , and minerals. If you’re in the early stages of CKD, there may be few, if any, limits on what you can eat. But as your disease gets worse, you’ll have to be more careful about what you put into your body. The doctor may suggest you work with a dietitian to choose foods that are easy on your kidneys. They might recommend: Cut the Sodium This mineral is found naturally in many foods. It’s most common in table salt. Sodium affects your blood pressure . It also helps to maintain the water balance in your body. Healthy kidneys keep sodium levels in check. But if you have CKD, extra sodium and fluids build up in your body. This can cause a number of problems, like swollen ankles , high blood pressure , shortness of breath, and fluid buildup around your heart and lungs . You should aim for less than 2 grams of sodium in your daily diet. Take these simple steps to cut the sodium in your diet: Avoid table salt and high-sodium seasonings (soy sauce, sea salt, garlic salt, etc.). Cook at home -- most fast foods are high in sodium. Try new spices and herbs in place of salt. Stay away from packaged foods, if possible. They tend to be high in sodium. Read the labels when shopping, and choose low-sodium foods. Rinse canned foods (veggies, beans, meats, and fish ) with water before serving. Limit Phosphorus and Calcium You need these minerals to keep your bones healthy and strong. When your kidneys are healthy, they remove the phosphorus you don’t need. But if you have CKD, your phosphorus levels can get too high. This puts you at risk for heart disease . What’s more, your calcium levels begin to drop. To make up for it, your body pulls it from your bones. This can make them weak and easier to break. If you have late-stage CKD, your doctor may advise you to get no more than 1,000 milligrams (mg) of phosphorus mineral each day. You can do this by: Choosing foods with low levels of phosphorus (look for “PHOS” on the label) Eating more fresh fruits and veggies Choosing corn and rice cereals Drinking light-colored sodas Cutting back on meat, poultry, and fish Limiting dairy and processed foods Foods that are high in calcium also tend to be high in phosphorus. The doctor might suggest you cut back on calcium-rich foods. Dairy foods that are lower in phosphorus include: Brie or Swiss cheese Regular or low- fat cream cheese or sour cream Sherbet The doctor might also tell you to stop taking over-the-counter calcium supplements and suggest a phosphorus binder, a medicine that controls your phosphorus levels. Reduce Your Potassium Intake This mineral helps your nerves and muscles work properly. But when you have CKD, your body can’t filter out extra potassium. When you have too much of it in your blood , it can lead to serious heart problems. Potassium is found in a lot of fruits and veggies, like bananas, potatoes, avocados , oranges , cooked broccoli , raw carrots , greens (except kale ), tomatoes , and melons. These foods can affect potassium levels in your blood. Your doctor will let you know if you need to limit this mineral in your diet. If so, they may recommend you try low-potassium foods, like: Apples and apple juice Cranberries and cranberry juice Strawberries, blueberries, raspberries Plums Pineapples Peaches Cabbage Boiled cauliflower Asparagus Beans (green or wax) Celery Cucumber As your CKD gets worse, you may need to make other changes to your diet. This might involve cutting back on foods that are high in protein , especially animal protein. These include meats, seafood, and dairy products. You may also need extra iron. Talk to your doctor about which iron-rich foods you can eat when you have CKD. DASH Diet DASH stands for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension. It’s a diet rich in fruits, veggies, low-fat dairy products, whole grains , fish, poultry, beans, seeds, and nuts. It’s low in sodium, sugars and sweets, fats, and red meats. Talk to your doctor about it if you have CKD. They’ll let you know if there are certain reasons you shouldn’t try the DASH diet . It isn’t an option if you’re on dialysis . What About Fluids? If you have early-stage CKD, you probably don’t need to cut back on fluids. But if your condition gets worse, your doctor will let you know if you need to limit those, too. To cut back on fluids you can: Avoid salty foods Manage your thirst with sugar -free hard candies, ice chips, or frozen grapes Track your fluid in a journal or with a marked container, and track your weight"
7,"Kidney Disease: Causes, Symptoms, and Treatment","What Is Kidney Disease? Kidney disease can affect your body’s ability to clean your blood , filter extra water out of your blood, and help control your blood pressure . It can also affect red blood cell production and vitamin D metabolism needed for bone health. You’re born with two kidneys . They’re on either side of your spine , just above your waist. When your kidneys are damaged, waste products and fluid can build up in your body. That can cause swelling in your ankles , nausea , weakness, poor sleep , and shortness of breath. Without treatment, the damage can get worse and your kidneys may eventually stop working. That’s serious, and it can be life-threatening. Kidney Functions Healthy kidneys: Keep a balance of water and minerals (such as sodium, potassium , and phosphorus ) in your blood Remove waste from your blood after digestion, muscle activity, and exposure to chemicals or medications Make renin, which your body uses to help manage your blood pressure Make a chemical called erythropoietin, which prompts your body to make red blood cells Make an active form of vitamin D, needed for bone health and other bodily functions Filter all the blood in your body every 30 minutes. While there's no cure for chronic kidney disease, there are lifestyle changes and treatments you can take to slow its progression. (Photo credit: iStock/Getty Images) Types of Kidney Disease Chronic kidney disease (CKD) CKD is a condition where your kidneys can't filter toxins or extra fluid from your blood as well as they should. While the condition can vary in how serious it is, CKD usually gets worse over time. Treatment can slow the progression of the disease. If left untreated, CKD may lead to kidney failure. At this stage, called end-stage renal disease (ESRD), the condition must be treated by dialysis or kidney transplant. Diabetes and high blood pressure are the leading causes of CKD. It's estimated that 1 in 7 adult Americans have the condition. But 40% of those with serious chronic kidney disease aren't aware they have the condition. Other common forms of kidney disease include: Polycystic kidney disease. This genetic disorder causes cysts (fluid-filled sacs) to grow on your kidneys, limiting their ability to filter waste from your blood. Lupus nephritis. Lupus is an autoimmune disease, meaning your immune system attacks healthy cells. Lupus nephritis is when your immune system attacks your kidneys. Interstitial nephritis. This condition happens when you have a bad reaction to a medicine that limits your kidneys' ability to filter toxins. If you stop the medicine, your kidney health should improve. Glomerulonephritis (glomerular disease). Glomeruli are the thousands of tiny filters that remove waste from your blood in your kidneys. This condition damages them, and your kidneys can't function as well. Inflammation in the glomeruli can happen after a strep infection, as well. APOL1-mediated kidney disease. Normally, the APOL1 gene helps make an immune system protein, but if you inherit a mutated version of the gene from both parents, you may be more at risk for kidney disease. You may be more likely to have this gene mutation if you identify as Black, African American, Afro-Caribbean, or Latina/Latino. Long-lasting viral illnesses. HIV and AIDS , hepatitis B , and hepatitis C may cause kidney disease. Pyelonephritis . This is a urinary tract infection within the kidneys, which can result in scarring as the infection heals. It can lead to kidney damage if it happens several times. Kidney Disease Causes Acute kidney disease causes: If your kidneys suddenly stop working, doctors call it acute kidney injury or acute renal failure . The main causes are: Not enough blood flow to the kidneys Direct damage to the kidneys Urine backed up in the kidneys Those things can happen when you: Have a traumatic injury with blood loss, such as being in a car wreck Are dehydrated or your muscle tissue breaks down, sending too much kidney-toxic protein into your bloodstream Go into shock because you have a severe infection called sepsis Have an enlarged prostate or kidney stones that block your urine flow Take certain drugs or are around certain toxins that directly damage the kidney Have complications during a pregnancy , such as eclampsia and preeclampsia Autoimmune diseases -- when your immune system attacks your body -- can also cause an acute kidney injury. People with severe heart or liver failure commonly go into acute kidney injury as well. Chronic kidney disease causes: When your kidneys don't work well for longer than 3 months, doctors call it chronic kidney disease. You may not have any symptoms in the early stages, but that's when it’s simpler to treat. Diabetes (types 1 and 2) and high blood pressure are the most common culprits. High blood sugar levels over time can harm your kidneys. And high blood pressure creates wear and tear on your blood vessels, including those that go to your kidneys. Defects present at birth can block the urinary tract or affect the kidneys. One of the most common ones involves a kind of valve between the bladder and urethra. A urologist can often do surgery to repair these problems, which may be found while the baby is still in the womb. Drugs and toxins -- such as lead poisoning , long-term use of some medications including NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) like ibuprofen and naproxen , and IV street drugs -- can permanently damage your kidneys. So can being around some types of chemicals over time. Alcohol and Kidney Disease Your kidneys are responsible for filtering harmful substances from your blood, including alcohol. When you drink, your kidneys have to work harder to perform their function. Binge drinking -- which for women is defined as having about four drinks in 2 hours, and for men five drinks in 2 hours -- can cause serious harm your kidneys. One risk of binge drinking is acute kidney failure, which is a sudden drop in kidney function that can damage the organs. Regular heavy drinking can increase your chances of developing chronic kidney disease. Even drinking two alcoholic drinks a day can increase your risk of high blood pressure, a common cause of kidney disease. Drinking alcohol can also disrupt hormones that help your kidneys function. Kidney Disease Symptoms Your kidneys are very adaptable. They can compensate for some of the problems that can happen when you have kidney disease. So if your kidney damage gets worse slowly, your symptoms will reveal themselves slowly over time. In fact, you may not feel symptoms until your disease is advanced. You might have: High blood pressure Nausea and vomiting Loss of appetite A metallic taste in your mouth Fatigue Weakness Trouble thinking Sleep issues Muscle twitches and cramps Swelling in your feet and ankles Itching that won't go away Chest pain if fluid builds up around the lining of the heart Shortness of breath if fluid builds up in the lungs How to Diagnose Kidney Disease Your doctor will start by asking questions about your family medical history, which medications you're taking, and if you notice that you're peeing more or less than normal. After that, they'll do a physical exam . You also may have: Blood tests to see how much waste product is in your blood Urine tests to check for kidney failure Imaging tests , like an ultrasound , to let the doctor see your kidneys A kidney biopsy , where tissue from your kidney is sent to a lab for testing to figure out the cause of your kidney issues Kidney Disease Treatment Some forms of kidney disease are treatable. The goals of these treatments are to ease symptoms, help keep the disease from getting worse, and lessen complications. In some cases, your treatment may help restore some of your kidney function. But there is no cure for chronic kidney disease. If a condition is “chronic,” that means it’s a long-term condition. If you have chronic kidney disease, you and your doctor will manage it together. The goal is to slow it down so that your kidneys can still do their job. First, your doctor will work to find out what caused the kidney disease. For instance, kidney disease can happen if you have diabetes or high blood pressure. You may work with a nephrologist, a doctor who specializes in kidney disease. You’ll take medicines and may need to change your diet. If you have diabetes, it needs to be managed. If your kidneys don’t work anymore, you might need dialysis (in which a machine filters your blood) and you could talk with your doctor about whether a kidney transplant would help. Medications for kidney disease High blood pressure makes chronic kidney disease more likely -- and kidney disease can affect your blood pressure. So your doctor may prescribe one of these types of blood-pressure medicines: ACE inhibitors, such as: Captopril (Capoten) Enalapril (Vasotec) Fosinopril (Monopril) Lisinopril (Prinivil, Zestril) Ramipril (Altace) ARBs, such as: Azilsartan (Edarbi) Eprosartan (Teveten) Irbesartan (Avapro) Losartan (Cozaar) Olmesartan (Benicar) Valsartan (Diovan) Along with controlling blood pressure, these medicines may lower the amount of protein in your urine. That could help your kidneys over time. The diabetes medicines dapagliflozin (Farxiga) and empagliflozin (Jardiance) have been shown to slow kidney disease even in people without diabetes. You might also need to take a medicine to help your body make erythropoietin, a chemical that tells your body to make red blood cells. So you might get a prescription for daprodustat (Jesduvroq), darbepoetin alfa (Aranesp), or epoetin alfa (Procrit, Epogen) to curb anemia. Medicines to avoid If your kidneys don’t work well, check with your doctor before you take any medications, including over-the-counter drugs (medicines you can get without a prescription). Your doctor may tell you to avoid certain pain relievers such as aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen (Aleve), and celecoxib (Celebrex). These drugs, which doctors call “NSAIDs” (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), could play a role in kidney disease. If you take a type of heartburn drug called a “proton pump inhibitor (PPI),” you may also want to know that some studies show a link between those medicines and chronic kidney disease. Your doctor may want to check on whether you need these medicines, or if a different dosage or something else might work better for you. Tell your doctor if you take any herbal products or other supplements. It’s best to have that talk before you start to take them. Diet for kidney disease Your doctor may put you on a special diet that’s lower in sodium, protein, potassium, and phosphate. This diet helps because if your kidneys are damaged, it’s harder for them to get those nutrients out of your blood. The special diet means that your kidneys don’t have to work as hard. You may also have limits on how much water can be in the foods you eat and how much you drink. A kidney diet specialist, called a renal dietitian, can help. Your doctor can refer you to one. They may also advise you to take specific amounts of vitamins and minerals, such as calcium and vitamin D. If you have diabetes or high blood pressure, you’ll need to follow your doctor’s diet advice if you have either or both of these conditions in addition to kidney disease. With diabetes, it’s important to make the right food choices so that your blood sugar levels stay under control throughout the day. And if you have high blood pressure, you may need a low-salt diet to help manage it. Dialysis If your kidneys don’t work well anymore, you’ll need dialysis to do their job. Hemodialysis uses a machine with a mechanical filter to cleanse your blood. You can get this done at a dialysis center or at home (after you or a caregiver learn how). With the at-home version, you may have to do it up to 6 days a week, about 2 1/2 hours per day, instead of three times a week at a clinic. There is also the option of hemodialysis treatment at night. Before you start hemodialysis, you’ll need surgery to make a place of access for the machine. Your surgeon may connect an artery and vein in your arm through a “fistula.” This is the most common type of access. It needs at least 6 weeks to heal before you can start hemodialysis. If you need to start dialysis sooner than that, the surgeon might be able to make a synthetic graft instead of a fistula. If neither of those options will work -- for instance, if you need to start dialysis right away -- you may get a dialysis catheter that goes into the jugular vein in your neck. When you get hemodialysis, another tube connects the machine to your access point so that your blood goes through the dialysis machine to be cleaned and pumped back into your body. This will take several hours. Peritoneal dialysis is a different form of dialysis. It uses the lining of the abdomen, or peritoneal membrane, to help clean the blood. First, a surgeon implants a tube into your abdominal cavity. Then, during each treatment, a dialysis fluid called dialysate goes through the tube and into your abdomen. The dialysis fluid picks up waste products and drains out after several hours. You’ll need several cycles of treatment -- sending in the fluid (or “instilling” it), time for the fluid to work in your abdomen, and drainage -- every day. Automated devices can now do this overnight, which may give you more independence and time during the day for usual activities. If you do it during the day, you may need to do the whole cycle several times. Both types of dialysis have possible problems and risks, including infection. You’ll want to talk with your doctor about the pros and cons of each option. Kidney transplant If your kidney disease is advanced, a kidney transplant could be a treatment option. A ""matching"" kidney may come from a living family member, from someone who’s alive and isn’t a relative, or from an organ donor who has recently died. It’s a major surgery, and you may go on a waitlist until a donated kidney becomes available. A successful transplant would mean that you don’t have to get dialysis. After your transplant, you will need to take medicines so that your body accepts the donated kidney. A kidney transplant might not be right for you if you have other medical conditions. Your age might also be an issue. And you may need to go on a waitlist until a kidney is available. You’d get dialysis until your transplant can happen. A kidney from a living donor will generally last 12 to 20 years. One that’s donated from someone who recently died may last 8 to 12 years. If you have “end stage” renal (kidney) disease, doctors consider a transplant to be the best option if you’re a good candidate. The plan you and your doctor will decide on will depend on what’s causing your kidney disease. In some cases, even when the cause of your condition is controlled, your kidney disease will worsen. Takeaways Kidney disease is often caused by high blood pressure and diabetes. There are no early warning signs for chronic kidney disease, so if you're at risk for CKD, do your best to regularly see your doctor, who can give you the blood and urine tests that screen for it. If kidney disease advances, you may require dialysis or a kidney transplant. Kidney Disease FAQs What are the three early warning signs of kidney disease? There are no early warning signs of CKD. Your doctor will check for the condition with regular blood and urine tests. Can kidney disease be cured? While you can take steps to slow the progression of chronic kidney disease, there's no cure for it. Advanced kidney disease must be treated with dialysis or a kidney transplant. Is kidney disease hereditary? Yes, kidney disease can caused by gene mutations passed from parent to child. If parents have a gene mutation -- or they're carriers of one -- there's a chance they could pass on the genes that could cause kidney disease in their child."
8,Diabetic Nephropathy,"What Is Diabetic Nephropathy? Diabetic nephropathy -- kidney disease that results from diabetes -- is the number one cause of kidney failure. Almost a third of people with diabetes develop diabetic nephropathy. People with diabetes and kidney disease do worse overall than people with kidney disease alone. This is because people with diabetes tend to have other long-standing medical conditions, like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and blood vessel disease ( atherosclerosis ). People with diabetes also are more likely to have other kidney -related problems, such as bladder infections and nerve damage to the bladder . Kidney disease in type 1 diabetes is slightly different than in type 2 diabetes . In type 1 diabetes , kidney disease rarely begins in the first 10 years after diagnosis of diabetes. In type 2 diabetes , some patients already have kidney disease by the time they are diagnosed with diabetes. What Are the Symptoms of Diabetic Nephropathy? There are often no symptoms with early diabetic nephropathy. As the kidney function worsens, symptoms may include: Swelling of the hands, feet, and face Trouble sleeping or concentrating Poor appetite Nausea Weakness Itching (end-stage kidney disease) and extremely dry skin Drowsiness (end-stage kidney disease) Abnormalities in the hearts' regular rhythm, because of increased potassium in the blood Muscle twitching As kidney damage progresses, your kidneys cannot remove the waste from your blood. The waste then builds up in your body and can reach poisonous levels, a condition known as uremia. People with uremia are often confused and occasionally become comatose. How Is Diabetic Nephropathy Diagnosed? Certain blood tests that look for specific blood chemistry can be used to diagnose kidney damage. It also can be detected early by finding protein in the urine. Treatments are available that can help slow progression to kidney failure. That's why you should have your urine tested every year if you have diabetes. How Is Diabetic Nephropathy Treated? Lowering blood pressure and maintaining blood sugar control are absolutely necessary to slow the progression of diabetic nephropathy. There are medications available which have been found to slow down the progression of kidney damage. They include: SGLT2 inhibitors including bexagliflozin (Brenzavvy), dapagliflozin ( Farxiga ), empagliflozin ( Jardiance ), and ertugliflozin ( Steglatro ), which help control high blood sugar. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors can help slow down the progression of kidney damage. Although ACE inhibitors -- including ramipril ( Altace ), quinapril ( Accupril ), and lisinopril ( Prinivil , Zestril ) -- are usually used to treat high blood pressure and other medical problems, they are often given to people with diabetes to prevent complications, even if their blood pressure is normal. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) can often be given instead if you have side effects from taking ACE inhibitors If not treated, the kidneys will continue to fail and larger amounts of proteins can be detected in the urine. Advanced kidney failure requires treatment with dialysis or a kidney transplant."
9,High Blood Pressure and Kidney Disease,"High blood pressure (hypertension) is a leading cause of kidney disease and kidney failure (end-stage renal disease). Kidney disease can also cause a type of high blood pressure called renal hypertension. Hypertension can cause damage to the blood vessels and filters in the kidney, making removal of waste from the body difficult. Once a person is diagnosed with end-stage renal disease, dialysis — a blood-cleansing process — or kidney transplantation is necessary. What Are the Symptoms of Kidney Disease? The symptoms of kidney disease include: High/worsening blood pressure Decrease in amount of urine or difficulty urinating Edema (fluid retention), especially in the lower legs A need to urinate more often, especially at night How Is Kidney Disease Diagnosed? As with high blood pressure, you may not realize that you have kidney disease. Certain laboratory tests can indicate whether your kidneys are eliminating waste products properly. These tests include serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen; elevated levels of either can indicate kidney damage. Proteinuria, an excess of protein in the urine, is also a sign of kidney disease. Who Is At Risk for Kidney Disease Owing to High Blood Pressure? Kidney disease caused by high blood pressure affects every group and race. However, certain groups are at higher risk, including: African-Americans Hispanic-Americans Native Americans Natives of Alaska People who have diabetes People with a family history of high blood pressure and kidney disease How Can I Prevent Kidney Disease? To prevent kidney damage from high blood pressure: Try to keep your blood pressure controlled. Make sure you get your blood pressure checked on a regular basis. Eat a proper diet. Get moderate exercise, such as walking, 30 minutes daily. Take the medication your doctor prescribes. How Is Kidney Disease Treated? For patients who have high blood pressure and kidney disease , the most important treatment is to control their blood pressure through lifestyle changes. Drugs can lower blood pressure and protect the kidneys from further damage, especially in people with diabetes. However, treatments need to be individualized. The most important blood pressure medications to treat renal hypertension include: Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. These include r amipril, benazepril, captopril, lisinopril, and others. Angiotensin II receptor blockers. Examples include candesartan, losartan, olmesartan, and valsartan. What Is Renal Hypertension? Although hypertension is a leading cause of kidney disease, there is a type of hypertension that is actually caused by kidney disease. Renal hypertension , also called renovascular hypertension, is elevated blood pressure caused by kidney disease. It can usually be controlled by the same blood pressure drugs. Some people with renal hypertension can be helped by angioplasty, stenting, or surgery on the blood vessels of the kidney. What Causes Renal Hypertension? Renal hypertension is caused by a narrowing in the arteries that deliver blood to the kidney. One or both kidneys' arteries may be narrowed. This condition is called renal artery stenosis. When the kidneys receive low blood flow, they act as if the low flow is owing to dehydration, so they respond by releasing hormones that stimulate the body to retain sodium and water. Blood vessels fill with additional fluid, and blood pressure goes up. The narrowing in one or both renal arteries is most often caused by atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries). This is the same process that leads to many heart attacks and strokes. A less common cause of the narrowing is fibromuscular dysplasia. This is a condition in which the structure of the renal arteries develops abnormally for unclear reasons. What Are the Symptoms of Renal Hypertension? Renal hypertension usually causes no symptoms. The narrowing in the arteries can't be felt. Unless it's dangerously high, high blood pressure causes no symptoms either. Symptoms of severely elevated blood pressure include: Headache Confusion Blurry or double vision Bloody (pink-colored) urine Nosebleed Chest pain The vast majority of people with renal hypertension never experience these (or any) symptoms. High blood pressure is dangerous, partly because there are no symptoms, so organ damage can occur slowly without being recognized. What Are the Treatments for Renal Hypertension? For most people with renal hypertension due to renal artery narrowing, medications can effectively control blood pressure. However, more than one blood pressure drug is often needed. In some people with renal hypertension due to narrowing of the renal artery, even taking three or more medications every day may not adequately control blood pressure. In these situations, a procedure to improve blood flow to the kidneys may help. Possible procedures include: Angioplasty . A doctor threads a catheter through a large artery in the groin and advances it into the renal artery. A balloon is then inflated for a few moments. This widens the artery and improves blood flow. Stenting. During angioplasty, a wire-mesh stent can be expanded inside the renal artery. The stent stays in place. This keeps the artery open after the balloon is removed. Research, however, has not shown that stenting is more effective than medication for most people with renal hypertension. Surgery. A surgeon can bypass the narrowed renal artery by sewing a healthy blood vessel next to it. Surgery is generally considered only when angioplasty and stenting are not possible and is only rarely performed. These procedures are similar to those used to improve blood flow in the heart in people with coronary artery disease ."
10,Acute Kidney Failure,"What Is Acute Kidney Failure? Acute kidney failure is when your kidneys stop working suddenly. Doctors sometimes call it acute renal failure. It can happen over just a few hours or days. Acute kidney failure isn’t always permanent. If you get treatment right away and if you don’t have other serious health problems, your kidneys can go back to working normally. The main job of your kidneys is to filter waste out of your blood . They also remove extra fluid from your blood (which becomes urine) and control blood pressure . Kidneys help make red blood cells. They regulate electrolytes (a type of nutrient) and activate vitamin D , too. Kidneys don’t work well when they’re damaged. This could happen because of another health condition, such as diabetes . Acute kidney failure vs. chronic kidney failure While acute kidney failure happens all of a sudden, a decrease in kidney function that happens over a longer period is called chronic kidney d isease (CKD). The most common causes of CKD are long-term conditions, such as diabetes or high blood pressure (hypertension). The symptoms you have or don't have will help your doctor determine which kidney failure you may have. Acute kidney failure involves a sudden decline in the functioning of your kidneys, which might be reversed. On the other hand, the symptoms of chronic kidney failure may not appear until there is only a bit of kidney function left and can be permanent. An ultrasound can confirm whether your kidney failure is acute or chronic. Kidney size can look normal for ultrasounds of both acute and chronic kidney failure; however, if the size of both of your kidneys is smaller, it's usually chronic kidney failure. The stages of kidney disease are based on your estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), which is a measure of your kidney's ability to filter. Your GFR corresponds to the percentage of kidney function. The kidney disease stages range from 1 to 5. (Photo credit: iStock/Getty Images) Acute Kidney Failure Stages The stages of kidney disease are determined by your estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), which is a measure of your kidney's ability to filter. An eGFR close to 100 is considered normal. Zero is the lowest eGFR, and this rate happens when you have no kidney function left. Your GFR corresponds to the percentage of kidney function. The kidney disease stages include: Stage I . GFR 90 or higher (up to 100). Your kidneys still work normally but you may have mild damage. Stage II . GFR 89 to 60. Your kidney function loss is mild and kidneys still work well. Stage IIIa . GFR 59 to 45. The loss of kidney function may be mild to moderate. Stage IIIb. GFR 44 to 30. Your kidney function loss is moderate to severe. Stage IV . GFR 29 to 15. You have severe loss of kidney function. Stage V . GFR lower than 15. Your kidneys are close to or at complete failure. Acute Kidney Failure Symptoms You may not have any symptoms of acute kidney failure. Your doctor may discover you have this condition while doing lab tests for another reason. If you do have symptoms, they’ll depend on how bad your loss of kidney function is, how quickly you lose kidney function, and the reasons for your kidney failure. Symptoms may include: Peeing less than normal Swelling in your legs, ankles , and feet (caused by your body holding on to fluid) Feeling drowsy or very tired Shortness of breath Itching Joint pain, swelling Loss of appetite Confusion Throwing up or feeling like you’re going to Chest pain or pressure Muscle twitching Seizures or coma (in severe cases) Stomach and back pain Fever Rash Nosebleed Acute Kidney Failure Causes There are three main reasons your kidneys fail all of a sudden. Something is changing the way blood flows through to your kidneys. It could be because of: An infection Liver failure Medications ( aspirin , ibuprofen , naproxen , or COX-2 inhibitors such as Celebrex ) Blood pressure medications Heart failure Serious burns or dehydration Blood or fluid loss You have a condition that’s blocking urine from leaving your kidneys. This could mean: Bladder , cervical, colon , or prostate cancer Blood clots in your urinary tract An enlarged prostate Kidney stones Nerve damage in your bladder Something has directly damaged your kidneys. This could happen due to: Blood clots Cholesterol deposits Medications that can directly damage kidneys, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAID s) such as ibuprofen and naproxen, chemotherapy , and antibiotics Glomerulonephritis, which is a condition where your kidney filters are inflamed.  This can be caused by an infection, autoimmune disease (such as lupus , vasculitis, and scleroderma), multiple myeloma , chemotherapy drugs, antibiotics , or other toxins Acute Kidney Failure Risk Factors Most of the time, kidney failure happens along with another medical condition or event. If you fall into any of the following categories, you may have a greater chance of acute kidney failure: You’ve been hospitalized for a long time, especially in intensive care. You have diabetes . You’re an older adult. You have coronary artery disease. You have heart failure or high blood pressure . You have chronic kidney or liver disease. Acute Kidney Failure Diagnosis Your doctor will start with a physical exam . Then, they’ll order tests of your blood, urine, and kidneys. Blood tests . These measure substances in your blood, including: Creatinine, a waste product in your blood that’s made by muscle activity. Normally, it’s removed from your blood by your kidneys. But if your kidneys stop working, your creatinine level rises. Urea nitrogen, another waste product in your blood. It’s created when protein from food is broken down. Like creatinine, your kidneys remove this from your blood. When your kidneys stop working, your urea nitrogen levels rise. Potassium, an electrolyte found in your blood that balances water levels in your bloodstream. Kidney disease can cause either high or low potassium levels. Sodium, an electrolyte that helps with fluid balance in your body. High sodium levels can mean that your kidneys aren’t working properly because your body can’t get rid of the right amount of sodium. Urine tests . Your doctor will check your pee for blood and protein. They’ll also look for certain electrolytes. The results help your doctor understand what’s causing your kidney failure. Kidney biopsy (renal biopsy). A kidney biopsy is a procedure where the doctor pushes a thin needle through your skin and takes a small piece of your kidney to look at under a microscope. It can show if there is any damage or disease in your kidney and often helps determine the cause as well. This is typically done only in cases where it is unclear what is causing the kidney failure. Imaging tests . Some tests, such as ultrasonography or a CT scan , can show whether your kidneys are enlarged or there’s a blockage in your urine flow. They can also tell your doctor if there is any problem with arteries or veins going in and out of your kidneys. An MRI can show this, too. Kidney Failure Treatment Often, treatment for acute kidney failure, especially if severe, requires hospitalization. If there aren’t any other problems, the kidneys may heal themselves. In most other cases, acute kidney failure can be treated if it’s caught early. It may involve changes to your diet, the use of medications, IV fluids, relief of anything that's blocking kidneys, or even dialysis. Diet . Your doctor will limit the amount of salt and potassium you get until your kidneys heal. That’s because both of these substances are removed from your body through your kidneys. Changing how and what you eat won’t reverse acute kidney failure. But your doctor may change your diet while they treat the conditions that caused it. This may mean treating a health problem such as heart failure, taking you off certain medications, or giving you fluids through an IV if you’re dehydrated. If your doctor has put you on a low-potassium diet, you’ll need to cut back on high-potassium foods such as bananas, spinach, oranges, potatoes, and tomatoes. On the other hand, you can eat more low-potassium foods such as apples, strawberries, grapes, and cauliflower. Medications . Your doctor may prescribe medicines that regulate the amount of phosphorus and potassium in your blood. When your kidneys fail, they can’t remove these substances from your body. Medications won’t help your kidneys, but they may reduce some of the problems kidney failure causes. Dialysis . If your kidney damage is severe enough, you may require hemodialysis until your kidneys can heal. Dialysis does not help kidneys heal but takes over the work of kidneys until they do. If your kidneys don't heal, dialysis could be long-term. Foods that may help repair kidneys It's important to maintain a well-balanced diet that's high in vitamins and nutrients and low in sodium. Fruits such as pomegranates, strawberries, blueberries, apples, cherries, and acai berries are all superfoods that can help manage kidney disease. Other foods include: Tofu Low-phosphorus cheese Nuts and seeds Whole grains Avocado Spices and herbs Beans Root vegetables such as carrots and onions Leafy greens Squash Alternative milk (vs. cow milk) Healthy oils and fats Tomatoes Broccoli Fish Flax and chia seeds Yogurt Eggs Shellfish Acute Kidney Failure Complications Acute kidney failure can sometimes cause complications. These include: Fluid buildup . Acute kidney failure can sometimes cause a buildup of fluid in your body. If fluid builds up in your lungs, this can cause shortness of breath. Chest pain . If the lining that covers your heart becomes inflamed, you may have chest pain. Acidic blood (metabolic acidosis). If your blood has too much acid due to acute kidney failure, you can end up with nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, and breathlessness. Muscle weakness. When your body's fluids and electrolytes are out of balance, you can get muscle weakness. In serious cases, this can lead to paralysis and heart rhythm problems. Permanent kidney damage . Acute kidney failure can become chronic, and your kidneys will stop working almost completely. This is called end-stage renal disease. If this happens, you will need to go on permanent dialysis (to filter your blood and remove toxins) or get a kidney transplant. Death . Acute kidney failure can lead to severe loss of kidney function, which can even cause death. Acute Kidney Failure Prevention You can reduce your risk of getting acute kidney failure by practicing some healthy habits. Be careful when taking over-the-counter (OTC) pain medications . Whether you are taking NSAIDs such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen or other types of OTC pain medications such as acetaminophen, it’s important to read and follow the recommended dosing instructions on the package. If you take too much of these medications, you could increase your chances of getting acute kidney failure. Follow your doctor’s advice . If you have a higher risk of getting acute kidney failure because of preexisting kidney disease or other conditions, make sure to follow your doctor's advice for treating and managing your condition. Keep a healthy lifestyle . Exercise, eating right, and drinking little or no alcohol can go a long way in preventing acute kidney failure. Takeaways Kidneys play an important role, as they filter out waste from your blood. When acute kidney failure happens, higher levels of waste can build up and chemicals in your blood can be unbalanced. This type of kidney failure happens quickly, but it can be reversed with treatment. If you have symptoms such as decreases in how often you pee, tiredness, irregular heartbeat, or swelling in the lower part of your body, talk to your doctor immediately or get emergency treatment. Acute Kidney Failure FAQs Can kidneys recover from acute failure? Yes. If treated soon enough, kidney damage from acute kidney failure can be reversed. Treatment includes finding out the cause and preventing complications while your kidneys heal. How long can a person live with acute kidney failure? Kidney function can return to normal if acute kidney failure is treated in time. Acute kidney failure can lead to chronic kidney disease (CKD) if it causes severe kidney damage. CKD can cause kidney failure, and life expectancy after treatment can range from an average of 5-10 years on dialysis to 8-20 years after a kidney transplant (depending upon whether the kidney is received from a live or deceased donor). How long does it take for acute kidney failure to develop? Acute kidney failure can develop in less than a few days."
11,Klinefelter Syndrome (XXY Syndrome),"What Is Klinefelter Syndrome? Klinefelter syndrome is a genetic condition in which a boy is born with an extra X chromosome. Instead of the typical XY chromosomes in men, they have XXY, so this condition is sometimes called XXY syndrome. Men with Klinefelter usually don’t know they have it until they run into problems trying to have a child. There’s no cure, but it can be treated. What Causes Klinefelter Syndrome? You get the extra X chromosome by chance. Either the egg or the sperm that came together to create you had an extra X chromosome. Older women have a slightly higher chance of having a boy with XXY syndrome, but the chance is small. Men with Klinefelter may have: An extra X chromosome in every cell, which is the most common An extra X chromosome in only some cells, called mosaic Klinefelter, in which you don’t have as many symptoms More than one extra X chromosome, which is very rare and more severe Symptoms of Klinefelter Syndrome Some men show symptoms of Klinefelter as children, but others don’t know they have it until puberty or adulthood. Many men never realize that they have it because symptoms aren’t always present. Symptoms of Klinefelter vary with age and include: Babies: Hernia More quiet than usual Slower to learn to sit up, crawl, and talk Testicles that haven’t dropped into the scrotum Weaker muscles Children: A hard time making friends and talking about feelings Low energy levels Problems learning to read, write, and do math Shyness and low confidence Teenagers: Larger breasts than normal Less facial and body hair , and it comes in later Less muscle tone and muscles grow slower than usual Longer arms and legs, wider hips, and a shorter torso than other boys their age Puberty never comes, comes later, or doesn’t quite finish Small penis and small, firm testicles Taller than usual for the family Adults: Infertility (can’t have children because they can’t make enough sperm) Low sex drive Low testosterone levels Problems getting or keeping an erection Klinefelter Syndrome Diagnosis To diagnose Klinefelter syndrome, your doctor will start with a physical exam and questions about your symptoms and general health. They’ll probably examine your chest, penis , and testicles and do a few simple tests, such as checking your reflexes. Your doctor may then run two main tests: Chromosome analysis. Also called karyotype analysis, this blood test looks at your chromosomes. Hormone tests. These check hormone levels in your blood or urine . Treatment of Klinefelter Syndrome It’s never too late to treat Klinefelter, but the earlier you start, the better. One common treatment is testosterone replacement therapy . It can start at puberty and can spur typical body changes, such as facial hair and a deeper voice. It can also help with penis size and stronger muscles and bones, but it won’t affect testicle size or fertility. Testosterone replacement therapy throughout your life can help prevent some of the long-term problems that come with Klinefelter. Other treatments include: Counseling and support for mental health issues Fertility treatment (in some cases, using your own sperm to father a child) Occupational therapy and physical therapy to help with coordination and build muscles Plastic surgery to reduce breast size Speech therapy for children Support in school to help with social skills and learning delays If your child has Klinefelter, things that might help include: Playing sports and other physical activities to build muscles Taking part in group activities to learn social skills Complications of Klinefelter Syndrome Many problems caused by Klinefelter are because of lower testosterone levels. You may have a slightly higher chance of: Autoimmune problems, such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis , in which your immune system attacks healthy parts of your body Breast cancer and cancers that affect your blood , bone marrow, and lymph nodes Conditions with your hormone glands, such as diabetes Heart disease and problems with blood vessels Lung disease Mental health problems, such as anxiety and depression Weak bones, called osteoporosis Prognosis for Klinefelter Syndrome Treatment can help boys and men with Klinefelter live happy, healthy lives. Advances in fertility treatments have made it possible for some to father children. In general, life expectancy is normal. Some research has found that life expectancy for men with the condition may be a year or two less than those without it  because of other health problems linked to Klinefelter."
12,Klippel-Trénaunay-Weber Syndrome,"Klippel-Trénaunay-Weber Syndrome. This is a rare condition that is present at birth that affects the development of blood vessels, soft tissues, bones and sometimes the lymphatic system. This image shows an adult in which the vascular malformations have begun to spread in a condition called angiomatous process. Sometimes a combination of port-wine stain and vascular malformations at birth may be the first indication of Klippel-Trénaunay-Weber Syndrome. Vascular malformations, varicosities, and phlebectasia develop as the child ages and usually cover an entire limb or other body area. Skeletal abnormalities are also possible leading to asymmetric limb enlargement or even webbed fingers or toes.

13,What’s Knee Replacement Surgery?,"You can’t move like you used to. It’s painful to walk the dog, climb a flight of stairs, or simply get out of a chair. You’ve tried medicines, injections, and physical therapy. Nothing seems to work. If that’s the case, it could be time to consider knee replacement surgery . Also known as arthroplasty, knee replacement surgery is one of the most common bone surgeries in the United States. It can help ease the pain caused by severe arthritis . It also may help you move more freely. U.S. doctors perform more than 600,000 knee replacement surgeries each year, many of which are now being done robotically. During surgery, an orthopedic surgeon removes the damaged part of the knee and replaces it with an artificial joint made of metal and plastic. The artificial joint is then attached to the thigh bone, shin, and kneecap with a special material such as acrylic cement. Why Would I Need Surgery? Osteoarthritis is the main reason why people go for knee replacement surgery. The age-related condition is very common and occurs when cartilage -- the cushion between the knee and the bone joints -- breaks down. Other reasons include: Rheumatoid arthritis : Rheumatoid arthritis is when the body’s immune system attacks and destroys the lining of the knee. Deformities : People with bowed legs or “knock-knees” often get surgery to restore the position of the knee. Knee injuries : A broken bone or torn ligaments around the knee sometimes will result in arthritis that causes great pain and limits your movement. Different Types of Surgery There are 5 main types of knee replacement surgery: Total knee replacement. This is the most common form. Your surgeon replaces the surfaces of the thigh bone and shin bone that connects to the knee. Partial knee replacement. If arthritis affects only one side of your knee, this surgery may be a possibility. However, it’s only right for you if you have strong knee ligaments and the rest of the cartilage in the knee is normal. Partial knee replacement can be performed through a smaller cut than is needed for total knee replacement. Patellofemoral replacement. This replaces only the under-surface of the kneecap and the groove the kneecap sits in.  This can be very effective for people with chronic kneecap arthritis. Complex (or revision) knee replacement. This procedure may be needed if you have very severe arthritis or if you’ve already had two or three knee replacement surgeries. Cartilage restoration: Sometimes when the knee only has an isolated area of injury or wear this area can be replaced with a living cartilage graft or cells which grow into cartilage. Different Designs Knee replacement surgery, which can take 1 to 2 hours, has become so precise that doctors can choose from a variety of knee designs that suit your height, weight , and activity level. The implants, as they are called, are made from a variety of materials, including metal, ceramic, or plastic. They are built to allow easy movement. Some implants are made just for women -- to closely match their anatomy. A common artificial knee design replaces the PCL ( posterior cruciate ligament ), located in the back of the knee. Another replaces the ACL (anterior cruciate ligament). Some artificial knees are designed for partial knee replacement, while others are built to keep the PCL and ACL right where they are. How Long Do They Last? Doctors first started replacing knees in the early 1970s. Back then, surgeons said the new knees would last about a decade or so. Today’s implants will last 20 years. By 2030, it’s estimated doctors will perform about 450,000 total knee replacement operations a year."
14,Kneecap Problems and Treatments,"Your knee is the largest joint in your body. The kneecap, or patella, is the bone that covers your knee. It helps give the joint strength and structure, which allows your legs to bend and turn safely. Because your knee has many working parts and carries a heavy load, it’s prone to problems. If you have any of these issues with your kneecap, see your doctor so you can figure out the right treatment. Some of them can get better with physical therapy, while others may need surgery. Dislocation Your kneecap can get knocked out of place, or dislocated, when your leg is planted and you suddenly change direction. It can also happen when something hits your leg and forces it in another direction. Signs that you’ve dislocated your kneecap include: The joint looks out of place, though it might move back on its own A popping sound or feeling Severe pain You can’t straighten your leg or walk Sudden swelling Patellar Instability and Dislocation Your knee also might dislocate without an injury because there’s a problem with the structure. That’s called patellar instability. It’s most common in children and teens , though it can happen in adults, too. Structural issues might include: The kneecap rests in a notch at the end of the thigh bone called the trochlear groove. If that notch is very shallow or uneven, it’s easier for the patella to slide out of place. Your ligaments are looser, making your joints more flexible and likely to dislocate. This is especially true of girls. Cerebral palsy and Down syndrome can cause muscle weakness and balance problems that affect kneecaps. Some children are born with unstable kneecaps. No matter the cause, symptoms of kneecap dislocation are the same. If it’s only part of the way out, you’ll get a brace to keep you from moving your knee. Within 1 or 2 weeks, you’ll start physical therapy to strengthen your thigh muscles. You can expect about 1 to 3 months for recovery. If it pops totally out, your doctor will first gently push it back into place. In some cases, you might also need surgery to repair damage to your thigh bone or the cartilage behind your knee. If it keeps happening, you may need surgery to tighten the ligaments and help keep your kneecap on track. Subluxation This happens when your kneecap slides a little out of place but doesn’t dislocate entirely. It’s also a type of patellar instability. Symptoms that your kneecap has subluxated include: Pain in the front of your knee A feeling that your kneecap is loose Your knee suddenly buckles Fractures This is a serious injury where you break your kneecap, usually: In a fall, landing directly on your knee A direct hit to your knee, like slamming it against the dashboard in a car accident If you break your kneecap, your symptoms might include: Bruises You can’t walk You can’t straighten your knee or keep it straight when you raise your leg If the broken pieces are still lined up, you’ll get an immobilizer brace to hold everything in place as you heal. Sometimes, you can still put weight on your knee . In other cases, you might be off your feet for 6 to 8 weeks. For a more serious fracture, you typically need surgery. Your doctor may use screws, pins, or wires to hold the bone pieces in place. In either case, you’ll need physical therapy to work through stiffness, get your range of motion back, and build leg strength. Patellar Tendon Tear The patellar tendon starts in your thigh muscles, wraps around your kneecap, and connects to the top of your shinbone. If you completely tear the tendon above the kneecap (the quadriceps tendon) or below it (the patellar tendon), you won’t be able to straighten your knee. Small tears. For small tears, you typically wear a brace and have crutches for 3 to 6 weeks. The brace keeps your knee straight while your tendon heals. You’ll also get physical therapy to help with leg strength and range of motion. Large tears. Most people need surgery for a large patellar tendon tear. It usually takes 6 to 8 weeks for the tendon to heal after surgery, but it can take up to a year for a full recovery. Patellar Tendinitis Also called patellar tendinopathy or jumper’s knee, this is an injury to the patellar tendon. It’s common with people who play sports like basketball and volleyball. You typically start treatment with basic self-care, like rest and over-the-counter pain relievers. From there, you might need to see a physical therapist who can: Reduce pain and swelling with ice massage, ultrasound , or iontophoresis, which uses a small amount of electricity to push cortisone , a drug, into your body through your skin Give you stretches and strengthening exercises for your thigh muscles Show you how to use a patellar tendon strap to relieve pressure on the tendon If these treatments don’t work, your doctor may talk to you about getting a cortisone injection to help with pain and swelling. The drawback with this treatment is that it can also weaken the tendon and make a tear more likely. Another option is to get an injection of platelet -rich plasma . But this has not been proven to work better than physical therapy or other treatments. It’s rare, but if nothing else works, you might need surgery to remove damaged tissue and repair the tendon. Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome This catch-all term describes pain in the front of the knee and around the kneecap. Sometimes it’s called “runner’s knee” or a “tracking” problem. Typically caused by overuse, patellofemoral pain syndrome can lead to pain, stiffness, or a buckling feeling in the knee and lower thighbone. It’s common in athletes, especially females and young adults. If you have this condition, you might hurt when you: Go up or down stairs Kneel or squat Sit with your knees bent for a long time, such as during a movie or plane ride You might also hear popping or crackling in your knees when you climb stairs or get up after you’ve been sitting a long time. Patellofemoral pain syndrome can happen because of strain on your knees, like climbing too many steps. The pain might start because you’ve suddenly started to exercise more, such as going from working out 3 days a week to 6. Or maybe you’ve made your workouts more intense. Other things that might bring on patellofemoral pain syndrome: Poor exercise technique The wrong equipment, such as shoes Changing your exercise surface; for instance, running on streets after you’ve been running on a track Often, it gets better with over-the-counter pain relievers and the “RICE” method: Rest. Avoid activities that trigger pain, and try not to put any weight on your knee. Ice. Wrap an ice pack in a towel and apply it 20 minutes at a time, several times a day. Compress. Use a stretchy bandage that has a hole for your kneecap. You want it to feel snug but not tight. Elevate. Keep your knee higher than your heart as much as possible. Your doctor may suggest physical therapy to: Improve strength and range of motion in your thigh, hip, abs , and lower back Show you how to tape your knee or use a brace to reduce pain Teach you how to correct your form if your knee moves in when you squat Rarely, you might need surgery to remove damaged cartilage , loosen tendons, or realign the patellar tendon and the top of the shinbone. Patellar Tracking Disorder Patellofemoral pain syndrome also may come from an alignment problem in how your knee works. When you have misalignment, or a patellar tracking issue, your kneecap can push to one side of the trochlear groove when you bend your knee. That irritates the area, causing pain. Tracking problems could come from overall alignment issues between your leg and hip. Weak thigh muscles can also be part of the problem. Chondromalacia Patellae Damage to the cartilage behind the kneecap is called chondromalacia. You may feel a dull pain around or under your kneecap that gets worse when you go down stairs. Again, you’ll start with self-care: Avoiding activities that cause pain Applying an ice pack wrapped in a towel for 15 to 20 minutes, four times a day for several days Over-the-counter pain meds You might also see a physical therapist for help with: Changes in how you exercise -- you’ll need to avoid high-impact activities as well as kneeling and squatting Choosing the best footwear for your activities Safe exercises to stretch and strengthen your thigh and hamstring Shoe inserts, if you need them Tape, brace, or a sleeve to keep your kneecap aligned If these treatments don’t work, you may need surgery to remove damaged cartilage and correct kneecap alignment. Prepatellar Bursitis A bursa is a small, fluid-filled sac. It eases friction between bones and soft tissue, like tendons. With prepatellar bursitis , the bursa in the front of your knee gets irritated and swells with extra fluid. That puts pressure on your knee that leads to pain. If it happens due to an injury, it usually goes away on its own with a little self-care: Avoid activities that trigger pain Wrap an ice pack in a towel and apply it for 20 minutes, three to four times a day Keep your knee above your heart as much as possible Take over-the-counter pain relievers If these treatments don’t work, your doctor may: Take fluid out of the bursa using a needle Give you a cortisone injection to help with pain and swelling If the bursa is infected, you’ll also need antibiotics . If they don’t help, you may need surgery to get out the extra fluid. If you have repeated problems with the bursa, your doctor may suggest you have surgery to remove it. Prevention You can’t avoid every possible injury to your kneecap. But you can take some simple steps to help keep your knees healthy: Wear the right shoes for your activity. Warm up before you work out. Do exercises to keep your thigh muscles (quadriceps and hamstrings) strong and flexible. If you’re going to make your workouts longer or more intense, do it gradually. Cut back on anything that causes knee pain . Stay at a healthy weight -- it lowers stress on your knees."
15,What Is Kratom?,"Kratom is a tree that grows naturally in Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Papua New Guinea. Its leaves have traditionally been used as medicine, but now they’re also being used as a recreational drug. Doctors believe some substances in kratom attach themselves to the same parts of a nerve cell as opioid painkillers and create a similar effect in your brain . But there haven’t been a lot of detailed studies into how it works or why. Doctors warn that it may have serious side effects and could be addictive. Because of that, several states have banned kratom products, and it’s considered a controlled substance in Thailand, Malaysia, Australia, and some European countries. In 2016, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) proposed banning kratom at the federal level, but they dropped that proposal to give scientists more time to study it. How Is Kratom Used? Traditionally, kratom leaves were chewed, brewed into tea , or used in cooking. Today it’s ground up in pills, or crushed and smoked like tobacco or marijuana . It has different effects at different doses. In low doses, it’s a stimulant that makes you feel more energetic. At high doses, it can make you sleepy or put you in a dreamlike state. What Are the Side Effects? The most common are nausea and constipation , but others include: Muscle tremors Itching Sweating Dizziness Dry mouth Seizures Hallucinations Liver damage Is Kratom Addictive? Some people who used it regularly said they had issues with pain , trouble sleeping , diarrhea , and fevers when they stopped using it. Some said they felt nervous, tense, angry, or sad when they weren’t taking kratom. Is It Safe? The FDA says there are no FDA-approved uses for kratom and that it has serious concerns about it. More research is needed to find out if it’s safe or if it has any medical value. In recent years, the agency has cracked down on companies that sell kratom as a treatment for withdrawal from opioids and other conditions. They also warn that some kratom products may be tainted with harmful bacteria like salmonella . The agency also has reported at least 44 deaths among people who used kratom, though many of them took other drugs along with it or used kratom that was contaminated with other substances."
