0,Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia,"What Is Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia? If your doctor says you have Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, it means you have a rare blood cancer that usually spreads slowly. It's also called lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL). This disease is a kind of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. These are cancers that start in white blood cells called lymphocytes, which are a part of your immune system -- your body's defense against germs. Some lymphocytes are called ""B cells,"" which help your body fight off infections. They do this by turning into plasma cells that make a protein called immunoglobulin M. This protein attaches to germs and helps your immune system target them. In Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, something goes wrong with this process. The B cells turn into cancer cells, which means they grow out of control. These cancer cells form mainly in your bone marrow, the spongy tissue in the center of most bones. They crowd out healthy blood cells. Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia cells can also cause problems because they make large amounts of immunoglobulin M. When this builds up, your blood can become thicker than usual. It's harder for your blood to move through your blood vessels. There's no cure for Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, but there are treatments that can help. Medicines can keep it under control, sometimes for many years. While you manage this disease, it's important to reach out to family and friends to get the backing you need. They can give you support while you get treatment and help you handle the emotional roller coaster that sometimes goes along with a cancer diagnosis. Causes Experts think that changes in your DNA may lead to the disease. Nine out of 10 times, Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia cells have a change on a gene called MYD88. Researchers have also linked another gene, CXCR4, to the disease. Both genes help cells send signals to each other, so they stay alive. The DNA changes may cause the genes to get stuck in the ""on"" position, so cells live longer than they normally do. Scientists are studying what causes these DNA changes. They know that they aren't passed down from your parents. Most of the time, the changes happen later in life. This may explain why Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia is usually diagnosed in older people. The disease is more common in men than women. Your chances of having Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia are higher if you: Are 50 or older Are white Have a condition called MGUS (monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance) Have a relative with a disease that affects their white blood cells. Symptoms You may not notice anything different. One in four people with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia don't have any symptoms when they're diagnosed. It's possible, though, that you may have a variety of health issues. As the cancer cells spread in your bone marrow, your healthy blood cell levels drop. Having fewer red blood cells causes a condition called anemia, which can leave you feeling tired. And if you have fewer white cells, it’s harder for your body to fight off infections. Your number of platelets -- blood cells that help you form clots -- may also drop. This can cause you to bleed or bruise more easily. And Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia cells in your organs can trigger swelling. Besides these problems, you may also get symptoms like: Headaches Night sweats Lack of appetite and weight loss without trying Frequent infections Fevers Swollen belly or lymph nodes Confusion, dizziness, and clumsiness Shortness of breath Changes in vision, such as blurriness Numbness or tingling in your hands or feet Getting a Diagnosis Your doctor will start by asking questions about your health history and do a physical exam. They may check for swelling in your lymph nodes, liver, and spleen. Your doctor may also ask you to take tests, such as: Blood tests. Your doctor takes a sample of your blood and sends it to a lab, where technicians look at it under a microscope. Blood tests show if you have low levels of healthy blood cells. They can also check the amount of immunoglobulin M proteins in your blood. Blood tests also measure how well your organs are working. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy. To confirm that you have Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, your doctor tests your bone marrow for cancer cells. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy are done at your doctor's office or in a hospital. In an aspiration, your doctor numbs part of your hip and puts in a thin needle. It sucks out a small sample of liquid bone marrow. Your doctor usually then does a biopsy. Another needle removes some of your bone marrow tissue. Your doctor sends the samples to a lab, where technicians check for cancer cells. They also test your bone marrow for markers of Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia. Imaging tests. Your doctor may want to see if the cancer has spread. These tests include X-rays and a CT scan, which is a powerful kind of X-ray. They're often combined with PET scans, which use a weak radioactive material to look for cancer cells. Questions for Your Doctor Where is my Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia located? Will I need any other tests to help guide my treatment? What are my treatment options and their goals? Which ones do you recommend? What are the risks and side effects for each treatment? How can I tell if my treatments are working? What kind of follow-up will I need? After treatment, are there any symptoms that I should watch out for? Treatment Your doctor will suggest a treatment plan based on your symptoms and how much the cancer has spread. If you don't have symptoms, your doctor may suggest a ""watch-and-wait"" approach. This means you won't get treatment, but they'll keep a close eye on your health. You may need to get blood tests every few months. It can be years before you need treatment. If you do have symptoms, your doctor may suggest one treatment or a combination of treatments: Chemotherapy. These drugs use powerful chemicals to kill cancer cells. You take them by mouth, or a doctor injects them into you. Biological therapy. You'll get medicines that help your immune system fight cancer cells. You might also use man-made versions of substances that your immune system makes. A doctor usually injects them into your body. Targeted therapy. These are drugs that block certain proteins or enzymes that help the cancer cells grow. The medicine often comes in pill form. Plasma exchange. Your doctor may want you to lower your levels of immunoglobulin M. To do this, you may need a plasma exchange. In this treatment, you're hooked up to an IV. Your blood is filtered through a machine that separates the liquid part of your blood, called plasma, from the blood cells, to remove immunoglobulin M. Healthy plasma gets swapped in. Stem cell transplant. In this treatment, high doses of chemotherapy kill the cancerous bone marrow. A bone marrow transplant replaces it with stem cells. These stem cells grow into new, healthy bone marrow. This procedure is not common for Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia. Clinical trials. In these research studies, you try out experimental treatments that have not yet been approved by the FDA. Your doctor can help you find out if one's right for you. What to Expect Because Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia usually spreads slowly, you can keep it in check if you catch it early. During treatment, you may have side effects. For example, chemotherapy can lead to nausea, temporary hair loss, diarrhea, and fatigue. Ask your doctor for advice on how to manage these problems. They may be able to suggest medicines that can help. After treatment, you'll need to go to follow-up appointments. Your doctor will check that you're healthy and that the cancer hasn't returned. Getting Support Consider joining a support group, where you can talk to others who understand just what you're going through. The groups meet in person, on the telephone, or online. To find a local support group, ask your doctor, social worker, or other people with your condition. You can also go to the websites of the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, International Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia Foundation, National Cancer Institute, and American Cancer Society."
1,What Is Geographic Tongue?,"What Is Geographic Tongue? Geographic tongue is a condition that causes red patches to form on your tongue or in other areas of your mouth. It gets its name because the patches look like a map. Doctors sometimes call it benign migratory glossitis . The patches can come and go and change shape. Their duration can range from a few days to several years. Geographic tongue affects about 1%-3% of people. It's benign, which means it’s harmless. It isn't linked to an infection or cancer . It isn’t contagious, so you can’t catch it from or pass it to someone else. It often doesn't have symptoms and usually goes away on its own. Geographic Tongue Symptoms The main symptom of geographic tongue is the presence of uneven red patches on the top, sides, and underside of your tongue. It's rare, but they might also be on your gums, inside your cheeks, or on the roof of your mouth. These patches may: Have a white or light-colored border Change in size, shape, and color Start in one area and then move to another Be smooth, unlike the small bumps (papillae) that usually cover your tongue You may not know that you have geographic tongue until your dentist or doctor spots it during a mouth exam. It's not common, but some people with geographic tongue might have a burning or painful feeling. This is often because of things such as: Hot, spicy, or acidic foods Cigarette smoke Toothpaste You might also have swollen lymph nodes under your jaw. Geographic Tongue Causes Doctors aren't sure what causes geographic tongue. It might be linked with certain health issues, such as: Eczema and psoriasis Some types of arthritis Type 1 diabetes Geographic tongue tends to run in families, so it might also have something to do with your genes. Also, not having enough of these nutrients might cause geographic tongue: Iron Zinc Folic acid Vitamins B6 and B12 Other things that might cause it are stress, hormone changes, and allergies. Geographic tongue is also linked to a condition called fissured tongue, which causes grooves to form on the tongue. Doctors don't know what causes a fissured tongue, but it's more common in older adults. Geographic Tongue Risk Factors Geographic tongue can happen at any age, but it’s more likely in young adults. It’s also more common in women than in men. Other things that raise your risk of geographic tongue: Eczema Psoriasis Type 1 diabetes Certain types of arthritis A family history of geographic tongue Not having enough iron, zinc, folic acid, and vitamins B6 and B12 Having a fissured tongue Taking hormonal birth control A lot of stress Allergies Geographic Tongue Diagnosis Your dentist or doctor will ask about your symptoms and look at your mouth and tongue. During the exam, your doctor might: Ask you to move your tongue in different directions Touch your tongue to feel changes in the texture Check for any tenderness See if there are any signs of infection, such as swollen lymph nodes in your neck You may need tests to rule out other medical conditions. Geographic Tongue Treatment Any pain or discomfort will probably get better on its own. But if you have severe, constant pain, medication can help. Your doctor or dentist may prescribe: Over-the-counter pain relievers Anti-inflammatories Mouth rinses with anesthetic Corticosteroids that you put on your tongue Zinc supplements It also helps to limit or avoid things such as: Tobacco Hot, spicy, or acidic foods or dry, salty nuts Toothpaste with additives (such as sodium lauryl sulfate), whitening agents, or heavy flavoring (toothpaste for sensitive teeth is a better choice)"
2,Skin Conditions and Warts,"Warts are skin growths that are caused by the human papillomavirus ( HPV ). There are more than 100 kinds of HPV, some of which can cause warts on the skin. HPV stimulates quick growth of cells on the skin's outer layer. In most cases, common warts appear on the fingers, near the fingernails , or on the hands. Certain types of HPV can cause warts to appear in the genital area. Warts are caused through direct contact with HPV, which is contagious. HPV may spread by person-to-person contact or through direct contact with an object used by a person with the virus. The virus that causes warts also can spread to other places on the body of the person with warts. Three out of 4 people will develop a wart (verruca vulgaris) at some time in their lives. Warts are caused by the HPV virus, which is contagious. Photo credit: iStock/Getty Images Types of Warts Plantar warts : This type of wart usually appears as a flesh-colored or light brown lump flecked with small clotted blood vessels that look like tiny black dots. Plantar warts affect the soles of the feet. Flat warts (verruca plana) are small pink or brown bumps that appear on the face or legs. They're caused by the human papilloma virus (HPV). Photo Credit: Dr. Harout Tanielian / Science Source Genital warts: Genital warts can appear in the pubic area, on the genitals, in or around the anus , and/or in the vagina . They look like small flesh-colored, pink, or red growths. The warts may look similar to the small parts of a cauliflower, or they may be very tiny and difficult to see. They often appear in clusters of three or four, and may grow and spread rapidly. They usually aren't painful, although they may cause mild pain, bleeding, and itching . HPV infection is the most common sexually transmitted disease in North America. Certain forms of the virus can cause cervical cancer . Flat warts: This type of wart is more common in teens and children than in adults. Flat warts are smoother, flatter, and smaller than other warts, and they generally occur in groups on your face. Flat warts also can appear on the legs, especially among girls and women. How Are Warts Treated? In most cases, warts on the skin are harmless and may go away without treatment. That includes flat warts, though they may take a few months or even years to go away. However, genital warts should be evaluated by a doctor. Warts sometimes come back after treatment, and you may need more than one type of treatment. Although doctors try to clear warts quickly, most methods to remove them require multiple treatments. Treatments include: Freezing (cryotherapy): This can be done with over-the-counter freezing spray products or by your doctor, who will use liquid nitrogen to freeze the wart. With the at-home treatment, temperatures can reach as low as a negative 100 degrees. The downside of home treatment is that it may not freeze the wart deeply enough to be effective. It can also be painful, since the spray needs to be applied longer than a freezing treatment you'd get in a doctor’s office. When it works, a blister forms around the wart and the dead tissue falls off within 1-2 weeks. Cantharidin: This substance is made with an extract of a blister beetle. It's applied to the skin and forms a blister around the wart. Then the area is covered with a bandage. The blister lifts the wart off the skin. This photo shows common warts (verruca vulgaris) on the toes of a teenage boy after treatment with salicylic acid. Other medications : These include bleomycin , which is injected into a wart to kill the virus that causes it, and imiquimod ( Aldara, Zyclara ), an immunotherapy drug that stimulates your immune system to fight off the wart virus. It comes as a prescription cream. Although imiquimod is approved for genital warts, it can also work fairly well on other types of warts. Salicylic acid : Over-the-counter wart treatments come in several forms (gel, ointments, or pads) and have salicylic acid as their active ingredient. When you apply the treatment on a regular basis, the acid gradually dissolves the wart tissue. The process may take several weeks. This is not for use on genital warts. Minor surgery: When warts can't be removed by other therapies, a doctor can do surgery to cut away the wart. They'll destroy the base of the wart  using an electric needle or by cryosurgery (deep freezing). Laser surgery: This procedure uses an intense beam of light (a laser) to burn and destroy wart tissue. Can Warts Be Prevented? If you already have warts, you can prevent them from spreading by not picking at them. Consider covering warts with bandages. In addition, keep your hands as dry as possible. Warts are harder to control in moist environments. Never brush, comb, or shave areas where you have warts, since this can cause the virus to spread. Wash your hands thoroughly after touching any warts. To prevent genital warts, some of the steps you can take include: Not having sexual contact Using condoms during sexual activity Having sex only with a partner who isn't having sex with other people Avoiding sex with anyone with visible symptoms of genital warts Getting the HPV vaccine"
3,How Do I Know if I Have Genital Warts?,"Both men and women can get genital warts , but the symptoms might be different. Here is what you need to know. Women In women, genital warts appear in and around the vagina , vulva, or anus , or on the cervix . They might be very small or appear as large clusters. They may be reddish in color or white. Sometimes, you can have genital warts but show no symptoms at all. If you’re a woman who’s had unprotected sex, you’ll want to have your doctor examine you. Testing for low-risk HPV -- the virus that causes genital warts -- isn’t routinely done. Your doctor will have to examine you to see if you have warts to know for sure. Warts may appear months or years after sexual contact. Sometimes, genital warts can form inside your vagina and be hard to spot. You could also have symptoms that look like genital warts but turn out to be something else. Men In men, the warts may appear on the penis , scrotum, or around the anus. For men, there’s no reliable test that can find the virus responsible for genital warts. You’ll need to ask your doctor for an exam or get regular exams. In both men and women, genital warts can also show up on the lips, mouth , tongue , and throat. See your doctor right away if you or your partner develops bumps or warts in the genital area or if: You have an abnormal discharge from your vagina or penis You have burning, pain , or bleeding when urinating or during sex Your partner is diagnosed with genital warts or is having some of the symptoms Your child has genital warts What Happens During the Exam? Your doctor will ask a number of questions, such as: Do you practice safe sex ? Do you have multiple partners? Have you or your partner been tested for sexually transmitted infections (STIs)? Are you having any symptoms? Are you pregnant or planning to get pregnant ? Your doctor will examine you or take a biopsy (a sample of the wart) to see if you have genital warts. They might draw a blood sample to test for HIV and syphilis . Depending on the results, they may also refer you to a specialist for further testing."
4,Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus,"What Is Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus? Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is a condition that happens when you have too much of a certain kind of fluid in parts of your brain. Your brain and spinal cord are surrounded by a clear liquid called cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). It’s made and stored in cavities in your brain called ventricles. It circulates around your brain , moving from ventricle to ventricle. It cushions and protects the brain and spinal cord, supplies them with nutrients, and removes some of their waste products. Extra fluid usually drains away from the brain and is absorbed by veins at the top of the brain. Hydrocephalus happens when the natural system for draining and absorbing extra CSF doesn’t work right. The ventricles enlarge to accommodate the extra fluid and then press on different parts of the brain, causing a number of different symptoms. Hydrocephalus has many different causes. Some people are born with the condition, while others develop it during their lives. Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is a type of hydrocephalus that usually happens in older adults. The average age of a person with NPH is over age 60. NPH is different from other types of hydrocephalus in that it develops slowly over time. There is an abnormal buildup of CSF over time and the drainage is blocked gradually. The extra fluid builds up slowly. It causes the ventricles to enlarge slowly and the fluid pressure in the brain may not be as high as in other types of hydrocephalus. However, the enlarged ventricles still press on the brain and can cause symptoms (the term ""normal pressure"" is somewhat misleading). The parts of the brain most often affected in NPH are those that control the legs, the bladder , and the ""cognitive"" mental processes such as memory, reasoning, problem solving, and speaking. This decline in mental processes, if it is severe enough to interfere with everyday activities, is known as dementia . Other symptoms include abnormal gait (difficulty walking), inability to hold urine ( urinary incontinence ), and, occasionally, inability to control the bowels. The dementia symptoms of NPH can be similar to those of Alzheimer's disease . The walking problems are similar to those of Parkinson's disease . Experts say that many cases of NPH are misdiagnosed as one of these diseases. Unlike Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, NPH can be reversed in many people with appropriate treatment. But first it must be correctly diagnosed. Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus Causes In most cases, the cause of NPH isn’t known, but several things can lead to it, including: A head injury Bleeding around the brain (due to a blow to the head) A s troke Meningitis (infection of a protective layer of tissue around the brain) Brain tumor Surgery on the brain How these conditions lead to NPH is not clear. Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus Symptoms At first, the symptoms of normal pressure hydrocephalus are usually very subtle. They worsen very gradually. Symptoms of dementia include: Memory loss Speech problems Apathy (indifference) and withdrawal Changes in behavior or mood Difficulties with reasoning, paying attention, or judgment Walking problems Unsteadiness Leg weakness Sudden falls Shuffling steps Difficulty taking the first step, as if feet were stuck to the floor ""Getting stuck"" or ""freezing"" while walking Urinary symptoms Inability to hold urine Inability to hold stool, or feces (less common) Frequent urination Urgency to urinate The following symptoms can be related to increased pressure in the brain: Headache Nausea Difficulty focusing eyes Some people think that memory loss , difficulty finding words, walking problems, or urination problems are normal parts of aging. In many cases, however, these are symptoms of treatable conditions. Any of these problems, or changes in mood or behavior, warrants a visit to your health care provider. Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus Diagnosis The symptoms of normal pressure hydrocephalus can also happen in people with Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease . However, the combination of dementia-like symptoms, walking problems, and urinary problems should alert your health care provider to the possibility of NPH. Making the distinction is very important because the treatments for these conditions are different. No lab test can tell if you have NPH, but other kinds of tests can diagnose NPH. At any point in this process, your health care provider may refer you to a specialist in brain disorders (neurologist or neurosurgeon) to complete the evaluation and begin treatment. The evaluation begins with a medical interview, when your doctor will ask about: Your symptoms and when they started Your medical and mental problems now and in the past Your family's medical problems Medications you have taken now and in the past Your work and travel experiences Your habits and lifestyle Then they’ll do a detailed physical exam to document your condition and rule out other disorders that might cause similar symptoms. The exam will probably include: Tests of your mental status, such as answering questions and following simple directions Neuropsychological testing to document your dementia symptoms. This is the most accurate method of pinpointing and documenting a person's cognitive problems and strengths. Lab tests to rule out conditions that might cause similar symptoms Your doctor also may recommend a few other scans or procedures: CT scan of the head: This scan is similar to an X-ray but gives a more detailed, 3-dimensional picture of the brain. It cannot confirm a diagnosis of NPH, but it can show ventricular enlargement or other changes that suggest NPH. Newer techniques can actually measure the flow of CSF in the brain. These findings alone may not be sufficient for diagnosis. This scan is safe and painless. MRI of the head : This scan uses radio signals and a strong magnet to create a detailed picture of the brain. It is safe and painless, like a CT scan, but takes longer (about 30 minutes). It also cannot confirm a diagnosis of NPH. Cisternography: This test is much more involved than CT scan or MRI and is not widely used. It highlights absorption of the CSF. Lumbar puncture ( spinal tap ): This procedure involves measuring the CSF pressure and removing some fluid from the area around the spinal cord in the lower back so it can be analyzed for abnormalities that might give a clue as to the problem. With a lumbar puncture, your doctor may remove more fluid than is necessary because that can sometimes help relieve symptoms (this is checked by comparing exam results before and after). If symptoms are relieved, it is usually temporary; improvement of symptoms with lumbar puncture is commonly interpreted as meaning that a surgical shunt would be helpful in that person. Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus Treatment and Home Care Normal pressure hydrocephalus can sometimes be managed or possibly even reversed through surgery. For those who are not candidates for surgery, treatment consists of measures to relieve mood and behavioral problems, cope with physical problems such as incontinence and walking difficulties, and maximize physical, mental, and social functioning. Surgery for normal pressure hydrocephalus Normal pressure hydrocephalus is not caused by any structural abnormality. In most cases, the underlying problem is not known or cannot be treated. The treatment in these cases is a shunt operation. A shunt is a thin tube that is implanted in the brain by a neurosurgeon. It is inserted into the ventricles to drain excess CSF away from the brain. The tube is routed under the skin from the head to another part of the body, usually the peritoneum (the lower belly). The shunt is equipped with a valve that opens to release fluid when the pressure builds up. The fluid drains harmlessly and is later absorbed by the bloodstream. The pressure setting on the valve sometimes must be readjusted. The newer shunts allow adjustment without another operation. A shunt operation is not a cure. It does not treat the underlying cause of NPH. It can, however, relieve the symptoms. The shunt remains in place indefinitely. If properly implanted, the shunt often is not obvious to other people. Shunt operations do not work for everyone with NPH. Many people who undergo a shunt operation have substantial symptom relief. In some, the symptoms improve and then start to worsen again. Others benefit little, if at all. Even the experts are not able to predict perfectly who will benefit and who will not. Many surgeons perform a spinal tap before surgery to test whether the symptoms get better with removal of fluid. In some cases, the person is hospitalized for a few days while fluid is drained slowly through a small tube called a catheter. This is another way of checking whether removing extra fluid will help symptoms. The earlier the NPH is diagnosed, the better the chances that the surgery will help. In general, people with milder symptoms have better outcomes with this surgery. Like any surgery, the shunt operation can cause complications. Such complications include infection of the shunt and blood clots around the brain. Your neurologist or neurosurgeon will discuss the pros and cons of this operation and whether it might work for you. Another operation is sometimes used instead of shunt placement. In endoscopic third ventriculostomy, an endoscope (thin tube with a lighted camera on the end) is used to create a small hole in the floor of the ventricles. The hole provides another way for CSF to drain from the brain. Caring for someone with normal pressure hydrocephalus An individual with normal pressure hydrocephalus should always be under the care of a medical professional. Much of the day-to-day care, however, is handled by family and caregivers. Medical care should focus on optimizing the individual's health, safety, and quality of life while helping family members cope with the many challenges of caring for a loved one with dementia and other symptoms of NPH. The degree of care required by people with NPH varies considerably. Those who undergo successful shunt surgery may continue to live a normal or near-normal independent life. Others will have worsening of their symptoms over time. Many of these individuals will eventually require close supervision and care. Your neurologist or neurosurgeon should discuss with you and your family what to expect as time goes on. It's important to know that no drug or other medical treatment is known to work in NPH. Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus Prevention There is no known way to prevent NPH. A healthy lifestyle, including not smoking , maintaining a healthy weight, and regular exercise , may help avoid conditions such as high blood pressure , heart disease , diabetes , and stroke that might contribute to NPH. Wearing a seatbelt and safety helmet when indicated can help avoid head injury, another cause of NPH. Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus Outlook NPH is a progressive condition, meaning that the symptoms gradually worsen if not treated. In general, the outlook depends on the cause of the hydrocephalus and whether you are a candidate for surgery. Some people improve dramatically after surgery, while others do not. Some are not candidates for surgery. Those who are not candidates for surgery have few treatment options available. If you have NPH, you should have regular visits with your neurologist or neurosurgeon. These visits allow the doctor to monitor your symptoms. Changes in symptoms may require adjustments in care. Support for Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus Coping with the symptoms of NPH can be difficult for both you and your family members. The condition affects every aspect of your life, including family relationships , work, financial status, social life, and physical and mental health . You may feel overwhelmed, depressed, frustrated, angry, or resentful. These feelings do not help the situation and usually make it worse. This is why support groups were invented. Support groups are groups of people who are going through the same things and want to help themselves and others by sharing coping strategies. Support groups meet in person, on the telephone, or on the internet. To find a support group that works for you, contact the organizations listed below. You can also ask your health care provider or behavior therapist, or go on the internet. If you do not have access to the internet, go to the public library.

5,What is Williams Syndrome?,"Williams syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that causes a variety of symptoms and learning issues. Children with this syndrome could have problems with their heart , blood vessels, kidneys , and other organs. Their nose, mouth , and other facial features may be unique. They sometimes have trouble learning. Children with Williams syndrome will need to see many doctors throughout their lives. But with the right treatment, they can stay healthy and do well in school. Causes Babies with Williams syndrome are born without certain genes. The symptoms they have depend on the genes they're missing. For example, someone born without a gene called ELN will have heart and blood vessel problems. The genes are usually missing in the sperm or egg before they meet up to form the baby . In a small number of cases, babies inherit the genetic deletion from a parent with the condition, but it is usually a random disorder in the genes. Symptoms Williams syndrome can cause symptoms in different parts of the body, such as the face, heart, and other organs. It can also affect a child's ability to learn. Facial Features Children with Williams syndrome have unique facial features that may include: Wide forehead Bridge of the nose is flattened Short nose with a large tip Wide mouth with full lips Small chin Small, widely spaced teeth Missing or crooked teeth Uneven eyes Folds over the corners of the eyes White starburst pattern around the iris, or colored part of the eye Long face and neck (in adulthood) Heart and Blood Vessels Many with Williams syndrome have problems with their heart and blood vessels. The aorta, the main artery that carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body, may be narrowed. The pulmonary arteries that carry blood from the heart to the lungs also may be narrowed. High blood pressure is common. Narrowed arteries don't let as much oxygen-rich blood reach the heart and body. High blood pressure and decreased blood flow can damage the heart. Growth Problems Babies born with Williams syndrome can be very small. They may have trouble eating, and might not gain weight or grow as quickly as other children. As adults, they are often shorter than most people. Personality Children with Williams syndrome may be anxious, but they also tend to be very friendly and outgoing. Learning Problems Learning problems are common in children with Williams syndrome. They range from mild to severe. Children are slower to walk, talk, and gain new skills compared to other children their age. They may have a learning disorder such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ). On the other hand , lots of children with Williams syndrome have very good memories and learn new things quickly. They tend to speak and read well, and often have musical talent. Other Possible Symptoms Curved spine , called scoliosis Ear infections Early puberty Farsightedness Hernia High levels of calcium in the blood Hoarse voice Joint and bone problems Kidney problems Urinary tract infections Diagnosis Williams syndrome is usually diagnosed before a child is 4 years old. Your doctor will do an exam and ask about your family medical history. Then the doctor will look for facial features like an upturned nose, wide forehead, and small teeth . An electrocardiogram ( EKG ) or ultrasound can check for heart problems. A bladder and kidney ultrasound can check for urinary tract conditions. Your child might get a blood test called FISH , or fluorescence in situ hybridization, to see if any genes are missing. Most people with Williams syndrome will not have the ELN gene. Because these issues can develop over time, doctors will want to see your child regularly. Treatment Many different caregivers can be involved in taking care of your child, including a: Cardiologist -- a doctor who treats heart problems Endocrinologist -- a doctor who treats hormone problems Gastroenterologist -- a doctor who treats gastrointestinal problems Ophthalmologist -- a doctor who treats eye problems Psychologist Speech and language therapist Occupational therapist Physical therapist Some of the treatments your child might need: A diet low in calcium and vitamin D to bring down high calcium levels in the blood Medicine to lower blood pressure Special education, including speech and language therapy Physical therapy Surgery to fix a blood vessel or heart problem Your child might need treatments for other symptoms, too. Living with Williams Syndrome A genetic counselor can help you learn your family's risk for Williams syndrome. This can be helpful if you plan to have children. Williams syndrome can't be cured, but treatments can help with symptoms and learning problems. Every child with Williams syndrome is different. Some can lead a very normal life. Others have more serious health and learning problems. They may need lifelong medical care. Resources To learn more about Williams syndrome, get help from an organization that specializes in rare disorders."
6,Breast Problems After Breastfeeding,"The wonderful bond you create with your baby when you breastfeed is like no other. And experts agree that breast milk is ideal for your infant. But even though you want to give your baby the best start you can, you can't help but be concerned. What will nursing do to your breasts ? Think of their size and shape, for example. Throughout your life -- and especially during pregnancy and breastfeeding -- the size and shape of your breasts can change. Breast size is determined by how much fatty tissue there is. Making milk creates denser tissue in your breasts. After breastfeeding , both the fatty tissue and connective tissue in your breasts may shift. Your breasts may or may not return to their pre- breastfeeding size or shape. Some women's breasts stay large, and others shrink. But sagging or staying full can be as much a result of genetics, weight gain during pregnancy , and age as a result of breastfeeding. Will My Breasts Sag or Become Flat? When you're nursing, the flow of milk can stretch your breast skin and tissue. That leaves some women with an ""empty"" or ""stretched out"" look to their breasts when the milk-producing structures shrink to the size they were before you got pregnant. It's a common cosmetic breast problem after breastfeeding, but it isn't a medical concern. Women often fear that breastfeeding will make their breasts sag. But other factors can change your breast appearance more than breastfeeding. These include: BMI -- body mass index, a measure of your percentage of body fat The number of pregnancies you've had A large pre-pregnancy breast size Age A history of smoking Will Breastfeeding Cause My Breasts to Be Misshapen? Each breast is independent. So what happens to one breast during breastfeeding won't necessarily happen to the other. Breast engorgement, or painful overfilling of the breasts with milk is a common condition that may leave one breast slightly misshapen afterward, for instance. Or one breast may produce more milk than the other, contributing to asymmetry of the breasts. Any dimpling or puckering of your breast may be a sign of a breast lump underneath and should be checked by your doctor. Do Asymmetric or Uneven Breasts Come From Breastfeeding? Breast tissue extends up toward your armpit . So, as breast tissue swells with milk and then shrinks again after breastfeeding, the contours of your bust line may change. Many women have uneven breasts before becoming pregnant as well as after breastfeeding. It's possible for one breast to return to its pre-pregnancy size while the other stays larger, droops, or flattens more. Some women end up with one breast a full cup size smaller or larger than the other after breastfeeding and simply learn to love the body that nourished their babies -- no matter what its shape. Should I Be Screened for Breast Problems if I'm Breastfeeding? Most breast problems after breastfeeding are cosmetic changes, not real medical concerns. But it's wise to stay up to date on your regular breast screening tests to ensure your breast health. Breast self-exams are a simple way to keep tabs on your breast health and changes. Examine your breasts once a month, even while breastfeeding. It's especially important to examine your breasts in the months after you stop breastfeeding, as the shape and size of your breasts change. Report any lumps or unusual nipple discharge to your doctor. Some lumps can even extend to the armpit. Most lumps are benign, meaning they are not cancer . But they still should be checked for breast cancer . A breast exam by your doctor can evaluate whether a breast problem after breastfeeding needs medical attention. Have your doctor perform a breast exam once a year or any time you notice unusual breast changes after breastfeeding. A mammogram (breast X-ray) can diagnose a lump too small for you to feel. If you have a breast problem after breastfeeding, your doctor may advise a mammogram right away, rather than waiting for your regularly scheduled yearly or biannual mammogram. It's also safe to have a mammogram while breastfeeding if you need one. It won't affect your milk or your baby's health. Call your doctor if you have any of these breast problems: A lump in your breast A red, sore lump that may feel hot to the touch, which could be a plugged milk duct Dimpling or puckering of your breast Fever or flu symptoms , which could indicate a breast infection (called mastitis) Nipple retraction (the nipple turned inward) Painful breasts (more than the discomfort related to breastfeeding) Rash on your breast Unusual nipple discharge or a bleeding nipple A positive note: Breastfeeding lowers your risk of breast cancer . Women who have never breastfed have a slightly higher risk. What's the Treatment for Misshapen or Asymmetric Breasts? When breast size or shape changes a lot after breastfeeding, some women consider cosmetic surgery . A breast lift, called a mastopexy, can be performed to help sagging and to reposition the nipple and areola (the dark circle around the nipple) higher on the breast. A thorough evaluation by a qualified cosmetic surgeon, including a complete breast health history, is advised before you consider surgery."
7,Long-Term Weight Loss: 5 Tips,"You want to lose weight and keep it off for good. These five strategies will help you do just that. 1. Set the Right Goals Most people trying to lose weight only focus on their ultimate goal: dropping pounds. But it's important not to lose sight of the diet and exercise changes that will get you there. Choose two or three diet and exercise goals at a time that you are willing to take on. And make sure they are specific and realistic. For example, ""exercise more"" is a wonderful goal, but it's not specific. ""Walk 5 miles every day"" is specific and measurable. But is it realistic if you're just starting out? ""Walk 30 minutes every day"" is better, but what happens if work or weather interferes? ""Walk 30 minutes for 5 days each week"" is specific and realistic. 2. Know Your Triggers Are there situations that make you want to eat more? Start noticing them. For example, you may learn that you're more likely to overeat while you're bored or stressed. Then figure out ways to get around those triggers. Do something else to soothe your stress, for instance. Also, you might want to put treats away. You're more likely to eat them if they're visible and easy to get to. 3. Fill Up on Food That's right: You should feel full. But how you do that might surprise you. It's mostly about time: 15 minutes, to be specific. You need at least that much time to feel full. So eat slower, giving your brain enough time to notice that you've eaten. What you eat can also help. Think fiber (like fruits and veggies) to fill up. Another trick is to use smaller plates so that small portions do not appear too small. Also, changing your eating schedule can help you reach your goal, especially if you tend to skip or delay meals and overeat later. 4. Reward Weight Loss Success (but Not With Food!) A good reward is something that is desirable, timely, and depends on meeting your goal. Rewards may include treating yourself to a movie or massage , taking an afternoon off from work, or giving an hour of time to yourself. Keep in mind that many small rewards, given for meeting small goals, can work better than bigger rewards for long, difficult goals. 5. Keep Track of Your Progress Jot down things like how much you exercise and what you eat. There are many apps that can help. Doing this can really open your eyes to what you are doing and what you need to do to meet your weight loss goals."
8,Burning Feet,"A burning sensation in your feet may be caused by nerve damage in the legs, also called neuropathy. Although many medical conditions can cause burning feet , diabetes is the most common. Most burning feet treatments focus on preventing further nerve damage and reducing pain. See More: What Your Feet Say About Your Health Causes of Burning Feet Most often, neuropathy is the cause of burning feet. Damaged nerve fibers are more likely to become overactive and misfire. The damaged nerves send pain signals to the brain even though there is no wound. In most people with neuropathy, the leg nerves become damaged first. These people often have tingling and numbness in the feet as well. Many people complain that their feet are overly sensitive to touch (hyperesthesia) and can have varying degrees of burning pain. It can range from mild to disabling. Diabetes and alcohol abuse are by far the most common causes of neuropathy in the legs. Many other conditions can cause neuropathy or a burning sensation in the feet: Chronic kidney disease (uremia) Small fiber neuropathy Vitamin deficiency ( vitamin B12 , folate, and occasionally vitamin B6 ) Alcohol abuse Low thyroid hormone levels ( hypothyroidism ) Lyme disease HIV /AIDS Amyloid polyneuropathy Drug side effects, including chemotherapy drugs, vitamin B6 overdose, HIV medicines, amiodarone , isoniazid , metformin , and others Erythromelalgia Heavy metal poisoning (lead, mercury, arsenic) Vasculitis ( inflammation of blood vessels) Sarcoidosis Guillain -Barre syndrome (GBS) Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) Besides neuropathy, infections and inflammation of the feet can also cause a burning sensation. The most common of these is athlete's foot , an infection of the skin caused by fungus. Peripheral artery disease (PAD) also commonly causes burning feet. The poor circulation of blood to the feet may frequently cause pain , tingling, and burning feet, especially while walking. Weeks or months after gastric bypass surgery , some people experience a burning feet sensation. Poor absorption of B vitamins after gastric bypass can cause neuropathy in the legs and a sensation of burning feet. Diagnosing Burning Feet Most people who have burning feet have a likely cause (such as diabetes ) that can be identified. For these people, the diagnosis of burning feet due to neuropathy is straightforward, and additional testing is not needed. In a few people whose burning sensation is sudden, rapidly worsening, or has no explainable cause, further testing may be needed to make a correct diagnosis. These tests may include: Electromyography (EMG). A test of muscle function using recordings of electrical activity inside the muscles. A probe may be placed on the skin, or a needle may be inserted into the muscle, for an EMG test. Nerve conduction study. A nerve conduction study tests the ability of nerves to transmit impulses. A nerve is stimulated, and the response in the muscle controlled by that nerve is measured. Laboratory tests. Sometimes, tests of blood, urine, or spinal fluid may be suggested to help diagnose the cause of burning feet. Vitamin levels can be checked with a simple blood test. Nerve biopsy . Very rarely, a doctor may suggest cutting out a piece of nerve tissue and examining it under a microscope. Treatments for Burning Feet The most important treatment for burning feet due to neuropathy is to stop any ongoing nerve damage . In some cases treatment of the underlying disease will improve the neuropathy and symptoms. In other situations, like a small fiber neuropathy, where no cause can be identified, the physician will focus on treating the person’s symptoms. For people with diabetic neuropathy , treatment means keeping blood sugar levels in the normal range. This usually requires dietary changes, oral medications , and often insulin injections. For people with other forms of neuropathy that cause burning feet, preventing further nerve damage is equally important. Specific conditions and their treatments include: Vitamin deficiency. Taking additional vitamin B12 orally or by injection can replace low levels of this nutrient. Alcoholism . Stopping excessive drinking prevents ongoing nerve damage and allows nerves to heal. Chronic kidney disease. Dialysis may be necessary to eliminate toxins causing neuropathy and burning feet symptoms. Hypothyroidism . Taking oral thyroid hormone raises low thyroid levels, often reversing neuropathy as well as burning feet symptoms. GBS and CIDP. Treatments are very specialized and include plasma exchange ( plasmapheresis ) or immune globulin therapy (IVIG). Burning feet treatments include treating the pain and abnormal sensations created by neuropathy. Some commonly prescribed medications for burning feet include: amitriptyline carbamazepine ( Tegretol ) desipramine ( Norpramin ) duloxetine ( Cymbalta ) gabapentin ( Neurontin ) pregabalin ( Lyrica ) topiramate (Topamax) venlafaxine ( Effexor XR ) Other pain medications may be necessary to reduce the severe discomfort some people experience from burning feet. Over-the-counter medicines like Advil , Aleve , Motrin IB, and Tylenol control pain in many people with burning feet. Prescription pain relievers like tramadol ( Ultram ) or low-dose opiates (narcotics) may be necessary for severe pain. For burning feet caused by athlete's foot, antifungal drugs can cure the fungal infection and relieve burning feet symptoms. Over-the-counter medicines like miconazole ( Micatin ) or terbinafine ( Lamisil AT) should be used first. Prescription antifungals like fluconazole ( Diflucan ), itraconazole (Sporanox), and naftifine ( Naftin ) are also available."
9,Cellulitis,"What Is Cellulitis? Cellulitis is a common infection of the skin and the soft tissues underneath. It happens when bacteria enter a break in the skin and spread. The infection causes swelling, redness, pain, or warmth in the skin. Cellulitis is a bacterial infection that can develop from a break or cut in your skin. (Photo Credit: iStock/Getty Images) Most often cellulitis affects the lower legs. It can be in the face, arms, and other parts of the body, too. Cellulitis can be serious if bacteria get into the bloodstream. Erysipelas vs. cellulitis Erysipelas is another type of skin infection. Both erysipelas and cellulitis cause the same symptoms -- swollen, red, warm skin. The two conditions can be hard for even doctors to tell apart. One difference is that cellulitis affects deeper layers of skin than erysipelas. Lymphedema and cellulitis The lymphatic system is a network of vessels that's part of your immune system. These vessels carry a fluid called lymph that flushes bacteria out of your body to prevent infections. Lymphedema is swelling under the skin caused by a buildup of lymph fluid. It happens when damage or a blockage in the lymphatic system prevents lymph fluid from draining. You're more likely to get cellulitis if you have lymphedema. That's because a damaged lymph system can't protect you as well against infections. Cellulitis Causes Cellulitis happens when there's a break in the skin and bacteria get inside. It usually shows up on damaged skin such as inflamed wounds, dirty cuts, and areas with poor blood circulation. Although many different types of bacteria cause cellulitis, the two most common types are Group A Streptococcus and Staphylococcus aureus . These bacteria live on your skin and underneath your fingernails. Bacteria get into a cut or tear in the skin from: An injury Surgery A skin condition such as eczema, athlete's foot, or psoriasis Foreign objects in the skin Open wounds underneath the skin Is cellulitis caused by poor hygiene? Breaks in the skin are the most common cause of cellulitis, but it can happen in areas that aren't clean. To lower your risk, wash your hands with soap and water before you touch your skin. Shower regularly and put on clean clothes. And clean any wounds to prevent bacteria from getting inside. Is cellulitis contagious? Cellulitis isn't contagious. Usually, it doesn't pass from one person to another. The only way it might spread this way is if one person has an open wound that directly touches another person's open wound. Types of Cellulitis Common parts of the body affected by cellulitis are your legs, feet, and toes, as well as your arms, hands, and fingers. Doctors also label types of cellulitis based on where the infection starts, including: Periorbital cellulitis This is an infection of the eyelid or the skin around the eye. It's most common in children. The cause is often an injury or sinus infection. Periorbital cellulitis usually isn't serious. Most children with this infection get better after they take antibiotics for about a week. Orbital cellulitis Orbital cellulitis is less common than the periorbital type, but it can be more serious. Like periorbital cellulitis, it starts when bacteria spread from an injury or sinus infection into the eye. But in this case, the bacteria get deeper into the fat and muscles of the eye. Orbital cellulitis can cause blindness without treatment. Perianal cellulitis This infection mainly affects children under 10. It starts in the perineum, the area between the anus and the scrotum in boys, or between the anus and vulva in girls. Strep bacteria most often cause perianal cellulitis. Facial cellulitis Cellulitis can affect the face, although a skin infection on the face is more likely to be from erysipelas. Facial cellulitis happens when bacteria spread to the face from a(n): Ear infection Gum infection Injury Insect bite Sinus infection Breast cellulitis Breast cellulitis is an infection of the breast. It happens when bacteria build up in the sweat underneath the breasts. The skin of the breast becomes red, warm, and swollen. Some people also have flu-like symptoms such as a fever and chills. You're more likely to get breast cellulitis if you: Are overweight Have large breasts Had surgery or radiation therapy to treat breast cancer Cellulitis in the breast can spread quickly if you don't treat it. Cellulitis from a bug bite Insects don't transmit the bacteria that cause cellulitis through their bites or stings. However, the break in your skin from a bite or sting gives the bacteria a way to enter your body and cause an infection. The bacteria that cause cellulitis live on your skin and in your nose and mouth, even if you're healthy. Cellulitis Symptoms Cellulitis symptoms usually start with a small area of skin that's red, swollen, tender, and warm. The skin may be pitted like an orange peel or develop blisters. You may have a fever and chills. Other common symptoms include: A sore or rash that grows quickly Warmth Pain or tenderness Tiredness Yellow, clear fluid or pus leaking from the area Get medical help for any of these more serious symptoms: High fever (100.4 F or higher) Nausea and vomiting Shaking chills (rigors) Growing or hardening of the reddened area Increased pain Numbness when you touch the area Dizziness Confusion Cellulitis Risk Factors You’re more likely to get cellulitis if you: Have an injury to the skin Have a weak immune system from diabetes , cancer such as leukemia, or HIV/AIDS Have c irculatory problems, such as insufficient blood flow to your arms and legs, poor drainage of your veins or lymphatic system ( lymphedema) , or varicose veins -- twisted, enlarged veins near the surface of the skin Had chickenpox or shingles Had cellulitis in the past Have a skin condition such as eczema , psoriasis , or athlete's foot Have liver disease such as chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis Are overweight Had a coronary artery bypass graft procedure Cellulitis Diagnosis Often doctors can diagnose cellulitis based on how the skin looks. Your doctor will ask about your symptoms and examine your skin. You might need a blood test to rule out other conditions with similar symptoms. Other procedures could include: An X-ray. This is used to see if there’s a foreign object in your skin or if the bone underneath is possibly infected. A bacterial culture. Your doctor will use a needle to remove fluid from the area and send it to the lab. Cellulitis Complications Rarely, the infection can spread and cause complications such as: Bacteremia, a blood infection Endocarditis, an infection of the inner linings of the heart's valves and chambers Osteomyelitis, a bone infection Sepsis, an extreme whole-body response to infection Toxic shock syndrome, a life-threatening condition caused by bacterial toxins Suppurative arthritis, an infection in a joint Necrotizing fasciitis, an infection that destroys tissue under the skin Get medical help right away if you have cellulitis along with any of the following symptoms: A large area of skin that's red and inflamed Numbness, tingling, or other changes in the affected area Skin that has turned black A red and swollen area around your eyes or behind your ears Cellulitis Treatment While treating cellulitis, the goal is to get rid of the bacteria that caused the infection. Usually, the way to do that is with antibiotics. Cellulitis antibiotics Cellulitis treatment usually includes an antibiotic such as dicloxacillin or cephalexin, which you take by mouth for 5-10 days. Which antibiotic you need will depend on what type of bacteria caused your cellulitis. Take the full course of antibiotics, even if you feel better. You may need to take antibiotics for 7-14 days or longer if you have a weakened immune system. Some people need more than one type of antibiotic. You may get treatment in a hospital if: Cellulitis doesn't get better after a few days of taking antibiotic pills It covers a large area of your body You have a weak immune system The infection is around your eyes The hospital can give you antibiotics right into one of your veins (IV treatment). You may need to stay in the hospital for a few days if you have a serious case of cellulitis. Cellulitis home remedies Take care of your wound. Keep it covered to help it heal faster. Your doctor will let you know if you need to put special dressings or medicines on the infected area. Here are some other ways to manage cellulitis at home: Prop up the part of your body with cellulitis. This will relieve swelling and help the infection heal. Hold a warm compress to your skin in the affected area. Wear a compression wrap or stocking to bring down swelling and improve blood flow. Ask your doctor if you can take an over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) pain reliever such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), aspirin, or naproxen (Aleve) to keep you comfortable. Cellulitis Surgery Most of the time, antibiotics are enough to treat cellulitis. Surgery usually isn't necessary, unless your doctor needs to open and drain an abscess or remove pus that has collected in the tissue. They may also cut away dead tissue to help the area heal. Cellulitis Prevention Use these tips to avoid cellulitis: Practice good personal hygiene, and keep your skin clean. Rub a lotion or moisturizer onto your skin to prevent cracks. Wear sturdy, well-fitting shoes or slippers with loose-fitting cotton socks. Don’t walk barefoot outdoors. Keep wounds clean. Wash the wound every day with soap and water and cover it with a fresh, clean bandage. Watch for signs of infection such as redness and pus. Trim your nails carefully to avoid injury. If you have diabetes, check your feet every day for sores you might not feel. Quickly treat any injuries or infections. Manage conditions that can cause cellulitis, such as eczema, athlete's foot, and lymphedema. To prevent insect bites, use an insect repellent approved by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Wear a long-sleeved shirt and pants when you go outside in areas where there are biting insects. Clean insect bites with soap and water. Apply an antibiotic ointment if the skin is broken. Cover the bite with a bandage to keep it clean and prevent you from scratching. Some injuries are more likely to cause cellulitis than others. See your doctor if you have: Animal or human bites Puncture wounds deeper than a half-inch, such as from stepping on a nail Crushed tissue that bleeds Burns that blister Frostbite Deep injuries with dirt in them Injuries that touch seawater (making them more prone to infection), especially if you have liver disease Diabetes or other major medical conditions, such as liver or kidney disease Swelling in your arms and legs that does not go away Cellulitis Outlook Cellulitis should go away after you take antibiotics for 7-10 days. You may need to take antibiotics for longer if the infection is serious. In rare cases, cellulitis can spread through the bloodstream and cause more serious problems, such as a heart infection or blood infection. You may need treatment in a hospital if that happens."
10,Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura,"Background Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), also known as primary immune thrombocytopenic purpura and autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura, is defined as isolated thrombocytopenia with normal bone marrow and in the absence of other causes of thrombocytopenia. ITP has two distinct clinical syndromes, manifesting as an acute condition in children and a chronic condition in adults. Pathophysiology ITP is primarily a disease of increased peripheral platelet destruction, with most patients having antibodies to specific platelet membrane glycoproteins. Relative marrow failure may contribute to this condition, since studies show that most patients have either normal or diminished platelet production. Acute ITP often follows an acute infection and has a spontaneous resolution within 2 months. Chronic ITP persists longer than 6 months without a specific cause. Epidemiology Frequency United States Incidence rates are as follows: The incidence of ITP in adults is approximately 66 cases per 1,000,000 per year. An average estimate of the incidence in children is 50 cases per 1,000,000 per year. New cases of chronic refractory ITP comprise approximately 10 cases per 1,000,000 per year. International According to studies in Denmark and England, childhood ITP occurs in approximately 10-40 cases per 1,000,000 per year. A prospective, population-based study in Norway indicated an incidence of 53 per 1,000,000 in children younger than 15 years. A study in Kuwait reported a higher incidence of 125 cases per 1,000,000 per year. Mortality/Morbidity Hemorrhage represents the most serious complication; intracranial hemorrhage is the most significant. The mortality rate from hemorrhage is approximately 1% in children and 5% in adults. In patients with severe thrombocytopenia, predicted 5-year mortality rates from bleeding are significantly raised in patients older than age 60 and those under age 40 -- 47.8% versus 2.2%, respectively. Older age and previous history of hemorrhage increase the risk of severe bleeding in adult ITP. Spontaneous remission occurs in more than 80% of cases in children. However, it is uncommon in adults. Age See the list below: Peak prevalence occurs in adults ages 20-50. Peak prevalence occurs in children ages 2-4. Approximately 40% of all patients are younger than age 10. Sex- and Age-related Demographics In chronic ITP (adults), the female-to-male ratio is 2.6:1. More than 72% of patients older than age 10 are female. In acute ITP (children), distribution is equal between males (52%) and females (48%). In adults, the peak prevalence is from ages 20 to 50. In children, peak prevalence is from ages 2 to 4. Approximately 40% of all patients are younger than age 10.

11,Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome,"What Is Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome? Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (WKS) is one name for two conditions that often happen together -- Wernicke encephalopathy and Korsakoff syndrome. Many doctors think of them as different stages of the same disease. They can happen if you don’t get enough vitamin B1, also called thiamine. Vitamin B1 helps your brain turn sugar into energy. When your brain and nervous system don’t get the amount they need, they don’t work as well. Wernicke encephalopathy typically comes on suddenly, and you’ll need treatment right away. Symptoms include confusion, loss of muscle coordination, and trouble with your vision . Korsakoff syndrome happens more slowly. It’s a long-term, ongoing problem that damages the part of your brain that handles memory. Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome Symptoms The main signs of Wernicke encephalopathy are: Balance and movement issues. You might have leg tremors, and your walk might become slow and unsteady, with a wide stance and short steps. You may need help standing and getting around, and your arms and legs might feel weak. Confusion. You may feel out of it and lose interest in what’s happening around you. Eye problems . You may have double vision , your eyelids might droop, or your eyes may move around quickly. You also may have problems with your heart and blood vessels that can lead to: Drowsiness Fainting A faster heartbeat than normal Low blood pressure when you stand up A lack of energy If you aren’t treated for Wernicke encephalopathy quickly, it can lead to Korsakoff syndrome. Symptoms of Korsakoff syndrome usually begin as the signs of Wernicke encephalopathy start to go away. The telltale sign is the loss of short-term memory. That also makes it hard for you to learn anything new or make new memories. You might talk to someone and seem like yourself. But a minute or two later, you won’t remember anything about it, not even who you spoke with. You may also have: Some long-term memory loss The urge to make up stories without knowing it to fill in any gaps Hallucinations A hard time putting words into context Trouble understanding or processing information Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome Causes and Risk Factors In many cases, the lack of vitamin B1 is caused by heavy, long-term alcohol use. Over time, alcohol affects how well your body absorbs, stores, and uses it. It also can happen if you don’t get enough nutrients from your diet or if you have certain health problems. These other causes include: Some diseases that affect your whole body, like cancer , AIDS , or serious infections Eating disorders , like anorexia Serious kidney problems Chemotherapy treatment for cancer Some stomach conditions Throwing up often and over a long period of time Weight loss surgery , also known as gastric bypass Men get Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome a little more often than women, and it typically happens in people ages 45-65. It's also more common in: People who are homeless Older adults living alone People with serious mental health conditions These groups are more likely to abuse alcohol or not eat well. Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome Diagnosis Typically, it’s based on a physical exam , your health history, and some tests. Your doctor will also want to rule out other problems that could cause your symptoms. You may get: Blood tests to see how much thiamine is in your system and how well your liver and kidneys are working Imaging scans of your brain to rule out problems like a tumor or stroke An eye exam to check your eye movement A mental health exam Tests to check your brain and nervous system Tests to look at changes in how you walk Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome Treatment The first step is to get plenty of vitamin B1. You’ll probably have it put directly into a vein through a needle in your hand or arm (an IV). You might need to have this every day for several months. From there, it’s important to stay away from alcohol and eat a balanced diet . That’ll help keep symptoms from coming back. If it affects how you walk, you’ll likely need physical therapy . Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome Complications Korsakoff syndrome typically can’t be reversed. In serious cases, it can cause brain damage and lead to problems with memory and your walk that don’t go away. Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome Outlook Your recovery will depend mostly on how early you started treatment. If you catch and treat it early, you can make a full recovery, but it could take up to a year. Confusion and issues related to it are often the last symptoms to go away."
12,West Nile Virus Questions Answered,"WebMD has answers to some common questions about West Nile virus . 1. How do people get infected with West Nile virus (WNV)? People get West Nile virus from the bite of a mosquito that has fed on an infected bird. Mosquitoes can't transmit the virus from one person to another. It's also possible to get West Nile virus from a blood transfusion or an organ transplant from an infected donor. Since all blood donated in the U.S. is tested for the virus, the blood supply in this country is considered safe. 2. What are the symptoms of West Nile virus infection? Four out of five people infected with West Nile virus don't have any symptoms. A few of these people may develop lingering infections that might cause problems years later. But most will become immune to the virus and never get a West Nile illness. One in five infections results in West Nile fever. Once considered a relatively mild illness, the CDC now says people with West Nile fever can be quite ill for quite a long time. The symptoms of West Nile fever include: Fever Headache Fatigue Skin rash on the trunk of the body (in some cases but not in others) Swollen lymph glands (in some cases but not in others) Eye pain (in some cases but not in others) In one in every 150 infections, the virus gets into the brain ( encephalitis ) or into the tissues covering the brain and spinal cord ( meningitis ). This is what the CDC calls ""neuroinvasive"" West Nile disease. About 10% of people who get West Nile encephalitis or West Nile meningitis die. Most people with neuroinvasive disease have either encephalitis or both encephalitis and meningitis. Some 25% to 35% get meningitis only. The symptoms of West Nile meningitis include: Fever Headache Stiff neck The symptoms of West Nile encephalitis include: Changes in consciousness ranging from mild (sluggishness) to severe (mental confusion, convulsions, or coma ). Fever and headache . Neurological symptoms, including paralysis of one or more limbs or palsy, may occur. Tremors and movement problems sometimes occur. Some people with West Nile infection become weak or paralyzed in one or more limbs. Two-thirds of these people are left with permanent weakness or paralysis. It's not yet clear what percentage of people with neuroinvasive West Nile disease get this syndrome, known as West Nile poliomyelitis. 3. How is West Nile virus treated? There is no specific treatment for West Nile virus infection. More severe cases require intensive hospital care. 4. What are the risks of West Nile virus infection for pregnant women? There have been a few miscarriages among women infected during pregnancy, but it's not clear whether the virus played a role. Most women known to have been infected with West Nile virus during pregnancy have given birth to normal, uninfected babies. While pregnant women appear not to be at particularly high risk from West Nile infection, uncertainties remain. The CDC advises pregnant and nursing women to take special care to avoid mosquito bites. 5. Should I continue breastfeeding if I have symptoms of West Nile virus? At least one woman appears to have passed West Nile virus to their child during breastfeeding . This appears to happen only rarely. The benefits of breastfeeding far outweigh the potential risk of West Nile infection to an infant. 6. What are the chances of dying from West Nile virus infection? The odds of getting the most severe forms of West Nile disease are about one in 150. The overall death rate in severe disease is about 10%. That makes the overall odds of dying from a West Nile infection about one in 1,500. These odds aren't the same for everyone. People over age 50, especially those who are elderly, are more likely to suffer severe consequences from West Nile infection. 7. How does West Nile virus actually cause severe illness and death in humans? West Nile virus causes severe disease when it crosses the blood/ brain barrier and infects the brain and spinal cord. The virus disturbs normal brain function -- including disruption of the nerve impulses needed for breathing -- which can be fatal. 8. Should people avoid donating blood or getting blood transfusions or organ transplants? Blood is lifesaving and often in short supply. Donating blood is safe, and we encourage blood donation now and in the future. Approximately 4.5 million persons receive blood or blood products annually. Although persons needing blood transfusions or organ transplants should be aware of the risk for WNV infection, the benefits of receiving needed transfusions or transplants outweigh the potential risk for WNV infection. 9. How do health care providers test for West Nile virus? If your doctor suspects you have a West Nile virus infection, they will send a sample of your blood to a lab for tests. The most common tests look for antibodies against the virus, showing that you've recently been infected. If you have symptoms of more severe disease, your doctor may perform a spinal tap to collect spinal fluid. As with blood, the spinal fluid sample is sent to a lab for tests. 10. Who is at risk for getting West Nile virus infection? Mosquitoes carrying West Nile virus are found in all of the lower 48 states. Mosquitoes are most plentiful in late summer. West Nile season usually peaks in August and September. People who spend a lot of time outdoors are at highest risk of infection. The mosquitoes that transmit West Nile virus are most active at dawn and dusk. Being outdoors during those hours increases the risk of infection. People over age 50 are more likely to develop symptoms of West Nile disease, but it's not clear whether older people are more susceptible to infection. Infants are not at higher risk of West Nile virus infection. And pregnancy does not increase a woman's risk of infection. 11. Can you get West Nile encephalitis from another person? No. West Nile encephalitis is not transmitted from person to person. For example, you cannot get West Nile virus from touching or kissing a person who has the disease or from a health care worker who has treated someone with the disease. 12. Where did West Nile virus come from? West Nile virus was first detected in the U.S. in New York City in 1999. It is not known where the U.S. virus originated but it is most closely related to strains found in the Middle East. 13. Is West Nile virus seasonal in its occurrence? In the U.S., West Nile virus cases occur primarily in the late summer or early fall. In southern climates, where temperatures are milder, West Nile virus can be transmitted year-round. 14. Is there a vaccine available to protect humans from West Nile virus? No. However, vaccines have been made against similar viruses, so a West Nile vaccine appears possible. 15. If I live in an area where birds or mosquitoes with West Nile virus have been reported and a mosquito bites me, am I likely to get sick? No. Even in areas where the virus is circulating, very few mosquitoes are infected with the virus. Even if the mosquito is infected, less than 1% of people who get bitten and become infected will get severely ill. The chances you will become severely ill from any one mosquito bite are extremely small. 16. If a person contracts West Nile virus, does that person develop a natural immunity to future infection by the virus? It is assumed that immunity will be lifelong; however, it may wane in later years. 17. If my dog/cat becomes infected with West Nile virus, does it pose a risk to the health of my family or other animals? While cats and dogs can get West Nile infections, they cannot spread the virus to people."
13,West Syndrome,"What Is West Syndrome? West syndrome is a type of epilepsy that affects babies. It’s named after the doctor who discovered it. Experts have many names for it, including: Infantile spasms (IS) Epileptic spasms X-linked infantile spasm syndrome X-linked infantile spasms Tonic spasms with clustering Hypsarrhythmia Lightning spasms Generalized flexion epilepsy Infantile epileptic encephalopathy Infantile myoclonic encephalopathy Massive myoclonia Salaam or jerk knife spasms What Are the Symptoms of West Syndrome? West syndrome causes seizures. They last only a few seconds, but they happen in bunches called clusters. There can be as many as 150 seizures in a cluster, and some babies can have up to 60 clusters a day. Sometimes, they don’t happen in clusters at first. Children with West syndrome may have other symptoms such as: Crankiness Loss of appetite Changes in sleep patterns, such as sleeping more during the day and less at night Acting like they can’t see Slowed development Regression What Are West Syndrome Causes and Risk Factors? This condition is rare. It affects fewer than 6 babies out 10,000. Most infants get it before they’re a year old, usually between months 4 and 8. A little over half of babies who have West syndrome are boys. Things that can cause West syndrome include: Changes in your child’s genes Metabolic disorders Unusual brain development or formation Brain injury from a lack of oxygen Other brain injuries Brain infection What Are the Types of West Syndrome? Your doctor may talk about three kinds of West syndrome, depending on the cause: Symptomatic. Another condition caused West syndrome, and your baby’s doctor knows what it is. Cryptogenic. The doctor thinks another condition caused it but doesn’t know for sure. Idiopathic. Your baby was developing the way they should before West syndrome, and the cause isn’t known. How Is West Syndrome Diagnosed? If your child’s doctor suspects West syndrome, they’ll ask for detailed information about your child’s seizures. Try to take a video before the appointment so you can show them what the seizures look like. This can help your doctor figure out if it’s West syndrome, which is often mistaken for colic. If your child is having seizures, they’ll need an electroencephalogram (EEG) to record the patterns of electrical activity in their brain. These patterns can show the difference between West syndrome and other seizure disorders. Your child may have these tests: Your doctor will do an EEG with your child awake. If the first EEG doesn’t show the expected brain pattern, they may do another one while your child is sleeping. An MRI or CT scan could show where in your child’s brain the seizures are happening. They also can rule out other conditions. Urine, blood, or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tests can help to find the cause. These may include gene tests. What Is the Treatment for West Syndrome? Treatments can help control the seizures. These may include: Medication The most common treatment for West syndrome is medication. Your doctor may want to try: ACTH, a hormone Vigabatrin (Sabril), a seizure medication Steroids like prednisone Vitamin B6 , if West syndrome results from a lack of vitamin B About two-thirds of babies who take ACTH or vigabatrin have fewer or less intense seizures. It may be a day or two before these treatments work. Medications like ACTH, vigabatrin, and steroids can have side effects, so you and your doctor will have to balance the good and the bad for your child. The side effects of these drugs include: Weakened immune system High blood pressure Digestive issues Crankiness Sugar in the urine Vigabatrin side effects include: Crankiness Permanent change in vision Sleepiness Shaking Throwing up Constipation Bellyache If these medications don’t work, your doctor might want to try: Benzodiazepines like Clobazam (Onfi) Rufinamide (Banzel) Topiramate ( Qudexy XR, Topamax, Topiragen, Trokendi XR ) Valproic acid (Alti-Valproic, Depakene, Depakote, Stavzor ) Zonisamide ( Zonegran ) Ketogenic diet Your baby’s doctor may suggest a ketogenic diet -- one that’s high in fats and low in carbohydrates. It isn’t something you should try to do by yourself. The doctor will want you to work with a nutrition specialist. You’ll still be able to breastfeed , but you’ll also have to use a ketogenic formula. The doctor may want to admit your baby to the hospital to start the process. The ketogenic diet can have side effects, like kidney stones , dehydration , and constipation. You and the doctor will have to watch your little one closely. Surgery If brain scans show lesions on your baby’s brain, they might need surgery. Your doctor might suggest a corpus callosotomy , which is sometimes called split-brain surgery. The corpus callosum is a band of nerve fibers deep inside the brain that connects the two halves. During this procedure, the surgeon will cut it so that seizure signals on one side of the brain can no longer travel to other side. Your baby may still have seizures, but they won’t be as intense. This surgery can also treat a common cause of West syndrome, tuberous sclerosis complex . In this condition, cancerous tumors grow in your baby’s body, including the brain. Some people with this condition do better with a type of surgery called resection, in which the doctor removes parts of the brain that are causing seizures. If your child has developmental delays , other types of therapies and assistance may help. These may include occupational therapy and postural aids. West Syndrome Outlook Usually, the spasms stop by the time a child is 4 years old. But most people who have West syndrome will have other kinds of epilepsy or seizure conditions when they’re older. West syndrome can affect your child’s development and ability to think. How severe their problems are depends on what caused the condition and how they were developing before they got it: If they were on track before, they may keep their mental ability or only have a mild disability. If their West syndrome came from a brain disorder or an injury, they're likely to have more serious problems. Babies with West syndrome usually have mental disabilities or trouble learning later in life, but up to 1 in 5 will have typical mental skills or only mild mental disabilities. About 7 in 10 babies with West syndrome have severe mental disabilities. They might get autism , especially if the syndrome came from tuberous sclerosis complex, a condition that causes noncancerous tumors in the body and brain. Or they could be hyperactive, which means it’ll be hard for them to sit still or concentrate. It’s rare, but some children who had West syndrome as babies will die before adulthood. It usually happens before the age of 10. Your baby is more likely to develop normally if: They were at least 4 months old before they got West syndrome. Their seizures aren’t unusual for West syndrome. They don’t have partial seizures. Their readings from an EEG -- which measures electrical activity in the brain -- are normal. (They don’t have what doctors call asymmetry.) They get treated soon after their diagnosis. Treatment gets their seizures under control quickly. In the Long Term The future depends on what caused your baby’s West syndrome. If it's from an injury, infection, or a condition like tuberous sclerosis complex, they may not fare as well. If there wasn’t another cause and their development was on track before it, their chances of a normal life are a little bit better than 50-50. The odds are even higher if they get treatment within a month of getting West syndrome. About 1 in 4 babies who have it will develop normally and be able to have a job when they grow up. How to Get Support Parents of children with West syndrome can find -- or give -- help via the Infantile Spasms Project, an online forum run by the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles."
14,Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS),"What Is Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome? Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a condition that causes fluid to build up in your lungs so oxygen can’t get to your organs. Fluid leaks from small blood vessels and collects in tiny air sacs in your lungs so they can’t fill with enough air. Because of this, your blood can’t pick up the oxygen it needs to carry to the rest of your body. Organs such as your kidneys or brain might not work the way they should or might shut down. ARDS is sometimes life-threatening and can get worse quickly. But it’s generally treatable, and most people recover. Fast diagnosis and treatment are important. ARDS Causes and Risk Factors ARDS is usually triggered by another health problem, so most people who have it are already in the hospital for something else. Causes of ARDS include: Sepsis . This is when you get an infection in your bloodstream and your immune system goes into overdrive, causing inflammation , small blood clots , and bleeding. Accidents. Injuries from a car wreck or a fall can damage your lungs or the part of your brain that controls breathing . Breathing in harmful things. Dense smoke or chemical fumes can trigger ARDS. Other possible causes of ARDS include: Pneumonia Bleeding that makes you need a transfusion Inflamed pancreas Drug overdose Near- drowning Burns Reactions to medications Breathing food into your lungs ( aspiration ) Doctors don’t know why some people get ARDS and others don’t. Risk factors include: A problem in your genes Heavy alcohol use Smoking tobacco Using oxygen for a lung condition Recent high-risk surgery or chemotherapy Obesity ARDS Symptoms ARDS puts a lot of strain on your lungs. Symptoms include: Shortness of breath Low blood pressure Unusually fast breathing Fast heartbeat Cough Fever Chest pain , especially when breathing deeply Confusion and exhaustion Blue-tinted lips or nails from lack of oxygen in your blood Dizziness ARDS Diagnosis and Tests No single test can identify ARDS. It’s more of a puzzle that your doctor pieces together. They’ll want to rule out conditions that can have similar symptoms. Your doctor will ask about your medical history, do a physical exam , and listen to your breathing and your heartbeat. They may also look for: Signs of extra fluid in your body Bluish color on your lips or skin Tests to help with diagnosis include: Imaging tests. A chest X-ray is crucial and probably the first test your doctor will order. You might also have a CT scan . These can give your doctor an idea of how much fluid is in your lungs and where it is. Blood tests. These check your oxygen level. They can also look for signs of infection or anemia , a lack of red blood cells. Heart tests . These can rule out conditions such as heart failure (when your heart doesn’t pump blood through your body the way it should). ARDS Treatment Treatment aims to get the oxygen levels in your blood up to where they should be, so your organs get what they need. In some cases, your doctor might give you an air mask and later go to a breathing tube and ventilator (a machine that helps you breathe). Your doctor will also treat other conditions that might be causing ARDS. Treatments include: Nutrition and medicine through fluids injected into your blood Medication to prevent bleeding and blood clots Medication to keep you calm and comfortable Most ARDS treatment is done in a hospital’s intensive care unit. Many people have a full recovery with no long-term problems. ARDS Complications The condition or its treatment can lead to other problems, including: Collapse of part of your lung because it can’t inflate the way it should ( atelectasis ) or because of air between your lung and your chest wall (pneumothorax) Organ damage or failure Confusion High blood pressure in the artery that goes from your heart to your lungs ( pulmonary hypertension ) Scarred lung tissue (pulmonary fibrosis) Blood clots Infection ARDS Outlook If you’ve recently had ARDS, improve your recovery by: Not smoking Not drinking alcohol Getting a flu shot every year and a pneumonia vaccine as directed by your doctor You might need to be on a ventilator for a while. ARDS can leave you weak, so you may go to physical therapy to get stronger. ARDS can be emotionally and physically tough on patients and families. A support group may help with anxiety , stress , or depression ."
15,What Is Wolf-Hirschhorn Syndrome?,"It can be very hard to learn that your child has Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome, also known as 4p- syndrome. Naturally, you have a lot of questions about what caused it and how it can be treated. Wolf-Hirschhorn is a rare genetic disorder that your baby gets when part of chromosome 4 is deleted. It happens when cells divide abnormally during reproduction. When any part of a chromosome is missing, it can damage normal development. The deleted chromosome 4 causes the features of Wolf-Hirschhorn, including facial features like wide-set eyes , a distinct bump on the forehead, a broad nose, and low-set ears. Each case is different, because the amount of symptoms depends on how much of the chromosome is deleted. What Causes It? Doctors don’t really know what causes this spontaneous genetic change that occurs during a baby’s development. The “broken” chromosome usually isn’t inherited from either parent; the deletion typically occurs after fertilization. Doctors do think that three different genes can be deleted from chromosome 4, and all are important to early development. Each missing gene causes a separate set of the condition’s symptoms. For example, one is linked to abnormalities of the face, while another seems to trigger the seizures that affect nearly all children with Wolf-Hirschhorn. Sometimes though, Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome is caused when one of the parents has something called a “balanced translocation.” That mean two or more of their chromosomes broke and switched spots during their development. It usually doesn’t cause any symptoms in that parent since the chromosomes are still balanced. But it raises the odds that person will have a child with a chromosomal disorder, including Wolf- Hirschhorn. You can get a genetic test to see if you have balanced translocation. What Are the Symptoms? Wolf-Hirschhorn affects many parts of the body, both physical and mental. The most common symptoms are abnormalities of the face, delayed development, intellectual disabilities, and seizures. Other problems your baby could have include: Bulging, wide-set eyes Droopy eyelids and other eye problems Cleft lip or palate Downturned mouth Low birth weight Microcephaly , or an unusually small head Underdeveloped muscles Scoliosis Heart and kidney problems Failure to thrive How Is It Diagnosed? Sometimes your doctor can find the physical signs of Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome with routine ultrasounds during your first trimester of pregnancy . Or chromosome issues could show up in what’s known as an expanded cell-free DNA screening test. But these are both just screenings, not diagnostic tests. Your doctor will need to do more tests to know whether your baby has Wolf-Hirschhorn. One test that can detect more than 95% of chromosome deletions in Wolf-Hirschhorn is called a “fluorescence in situ hybridization” (FISH) test. Tests done after your baby is born also can identify the partial deletion of the chromosome. If your doctor confirms your child has Wolf-Hirschhorn, they may suggest several imaging tests to fully understand all affected areas of your baby’s body. You and your partner also should be tested if you plan to have more children in the future. How Is It Treated? There is no cure for Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome, and every patient is unique, so treatment plans are tailored to manage the symptoms. Most plans will include: Physical or occupational therapy Surgery to repair defects Support through social services Genetic counseling Special education Controlling seizures Drug therapy"
16,Wheezing,"What Is Wheezing? Wheezing is a high-pitched, coarse whistling sound when you breathe . Many people with respiratory allergies know that wheezing often comes with hay fever season. It may also happen because of respiratory infections like acute bronchitis. But chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) and asthma are the most common causes. A number of treatments can ease wheezing. Your doctor should keep close watch if you have asthma, severe allergies, long-term bronchitis , emphysema , or COPD . You also may need to see a specialist such as an allergist or pulmonologist . Wheezing can come with a variety of health conditions. But see your doctor if you have trouble breathing, your breathing gets fast, or your skin turns blue for a short time. Go to the ER if you start wheezing during a severe allergic reaction. What Causes Wheezing? The whistling sound happens when air moves through narrowed airways, much like the way a whistle or flute makes music. Many health problems can cause wheezing , including: Asthma . This condition, in which your airways narrow, swell, and make extra mucus , can make it hard to breathe. Allergic reactions to pollen , chemicals, pet dander, dust, foods, or insect stings Bronchitis COPD Cystic fibrosis , which damages your lungs and makes the mucus extra sticky and thick Obstruction of an airway because you’ve inhaled an object such as a coin Lung cancer Congestive heart failure Pneumonia . This infection inflames the air sacs in your lungs, and they fill with fluid or pus. Bronchiolitis. This lung infection inflames airways and causes congestion , usually in children. Emphysema, a lung condition that causes shortness of breath Smoking or breathing in smoke Respiratory syncytial virus . This can lead to bronchiolitis. Gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) Vocal cord problems Sleep apnea Wheezing Risk Factors Anyone can have wheezing. It often happens in infants, possibly because of their smaller airways. It’s also common in children who have asthma or bronchiolitis. Adults who smoke or who have emphysema or heart failure are more likely to have wheezing. When to See a Doctor Mild wheezing, the type that happens when you have a cold , should go away when the illness does. But you should see a doctor if you have: Trouble breathing Fast breathing Skin that briefly turns blue Go to the ER if your wheezing: Starts soon after you’re stung by a bee or just after you take medication or eat food that can cause an allergy Comes with severe breathing trouble or bluish skin Happens after you choke on a bit of food Diagnosing the Cause of Wheezing Your doctor will ask you questions like: How long have you been wheezing? Does it happen when you exercise ? Do you wheeze all the time? Do you wheeze more during the day, or at night? Does rest help control it? Do you wheeze when you breathe in, or out, or both in and out? Do you smoke? Do certain foods seem to cause your wheezing? They’ll listen to your breathing and the sounds your lungs make. They might do tests like: X-rays to get a picture of your lungs Lung function tests to see how well they’re working A blood test to check your oxygen levels (Those that are too low could signal a lung problem.) If your child is wheezing, their doctor might check to see if they’ve swallowed or inhaled something small. How Is Wheezing Treated? The first thing your doctor may do is give you oxygen. You might need to stay in the hospital until you get better. After that, treatment depends on the cause. Some common causes and treatments include: Asthma. Your doctor will probably prescribe: A bronchodilator medication to ease inflammation and open your airways Inhaled corticosteroids to fight inflammation Leukotriene receptor antagonists to prevent asthma and allergy symptoms Bronchitis. Your doctor will prescribe: A bronchodilator to open your airways An antibiotic to fight a bacterial infection How to Stop Wheezing There are a few things you can do to prevent wheezing: Keep the air moist. Use a humidifier , take a warm, steamy shower, or sit in the bathroom with the door closed while running a hot shower. Drink something warm. It relaxes your airways and loosens sticky mucus . Don’t smoke. And stay away from people who do. Follow your doctor’s orders. Take your medicines according to the instructions. Clean the air. Use an air cleaner with a HEPA filter . This will cut down on allergens that often lead to asthma attacks . Breathing Exercises for Wheezing Breathing exercises can help your lungs work better. Try these: Pursed-lip breathing . Breathe in through your nose. Breathe out for twice as long, with your lips pursed like you’re going to whistle. Belly breathing . Breathe in through your nose. Put your hands on your belly and pay attention to how it expands. Breathe out through your mouth for at least two to three times as long as you breathed in."
17,Whiplash,"Whiplash , also called neck sprain or neck strain, is injury to the neck. Whiplash is characterized by a collection of symptoms that occur following damage to the neck. In whiplash, the intervertebral joints (located between vertebrae), discs, and ligaments, cervical muscles, and nerve roots may become damaged. What Causes Whiplash? Whiplash is caused by an abrupt backward and/or forward jerking motion of the head, often as a result of a car accident. What Are the Symptoms of Whiplash? Symptoms of whiplash may be delayed for 24 hours or more after the initial trauma. However, people who experience whiplash may develop one or more of the following symptoms, usually within the first few days after the injury: Neck pain and stiffness Headaches Pain in the shoulder or between the shoulder blades Low back pain Pain or numbness in the arm and/or hand Dizziness Difficulty concentrating or remembering Irritability, sleep disturbances, fatigue How Is Whiplash Diagnosed? In most cases, injuries are to soft tissues such as the discs, muscles and ligaments, and cannot be seen on standard X-rays. Specialized imaging tests, such as CT scans or magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ), may be required to diagnose damage to the discs, muscles or ligaments that could be causing the symptoms of whiplash. How Is Whiplash Treated? No single treatment has been scientifically proven as effective for whiplash, but pain relief medications such as ibuprofen ( Motrin , Advil ) or naproxen ( Aleve , Naprosyn ), along with gentle exercises, physical therapy , traction, massage , heat, ice, injections and ultrasound , all have been helpful for certain patients. In the past, whiplash injuries were often treated with immobilization in a cervical collar. However, the current trend is to encourage early movement instead of immobilization. Ice is often recommended for the first 24 hours, followed by gentle, active movement."
18,What Is Whipple’s Disease?,"Whipple’s disease was first recognized in 1907 by George Hoyt Whipple. The case centered on a man who had problems with weight loss , arthritis , chronic cough , and fever . More than a century later, doctors still don’t know much about the disease, but they do have ways to treat it. Whipple’s disease is a bacterial infection . The bacteria usually affect your digestive system , especially your small intestine, but they can cause problems in other parts of your body, too, like your heart , joints, lungs , eyes , and immune system . And up to 40% of people with Whipple’s disease also have issues related to their nervous system, which includes your brain , spinal cord, and the network of nerves that run throughout your body. If it’s not treated, Whipple’s disease can be life-threatening in a short amount of time. Doctors only know of a few hundred cases of the condition, most in North America and western Europe. White men and people older than 40 are most likely to get it. Symptoms Whipple’s disease can affect how you digest food and take in nutrients. It can make you weak and tired and lead to: Belly pain Diarrhea Weight loss Dark spots on your skin Joint pain If it affects your nervous system, it can bring on: Loss of muscle control Confusion and memory loss Seizures Vision problems In some people, Whipple's disease can cause coughing , fever, and chest pain . Causes Bacteria called T. whipplei cause Whipple’s disease. Scientists aren’t exactly sure how the bacteria get in your body, but they think it may be a part of some people’s normal mix of bacteria or it may come in through your mouth . There’s no evidence that it can be passed from person to person. Researchers have found that many people with the disease work with or near soil, like on farms or in construction, or have a problem with their immune system. It also may be linked to a problem gene. Diagnosis If your doctor thinks you might have Whipple’s disease, they’ll talk with you about your medical history and do a physical exam to check for pain or tenderness in your belly or dark spots on your skin. They’ll also test a sample of your blood to see if you’re low on any nutrients. They’ll probably recommend a procedure called an upper GI endoscopy -- a flexible tube with a camera on the end lets your doctor get a closer look at the lining of your stomach and take a sample to be tested for T. whipplei . You’ll get medicine to help you relax during the procedure. Treatment If tests show that you have Whipple’s disease, your doctor will give you antibiotics through an IV in your arm to kill the bacteria. They also may recommend fluids to keep you hydrated and extra vitamins and minerals to make sure you get enough nutrients. You should feel better in a couple of weeks, but it may take your small intestine up to 2 years to recover. During that time, you’ll continue to take antibiotics and supplements. If you have problems related to your nervous system, your doctor will use a combination of antibiotics, steroids , and other drugs , depending on your symptoms. Whipple’s disease can come back. You’ll need to see your doctor for regular checkups so you can treat it quickly if it does."
19,Whooping Cough (Pertussis),"What Is Whooping Cough? Whooping cough (also known as pertussis ) is a bacterial infection that affects your respiratory tract, especially your nose and throat. It causes long stretches of severe coughs that sometimes end with a whooping sound. It spreads easily, but vaccines such as DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis) for infants and children and Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis) for older children and adults can help prevent it. Before the vaccine was created, whooping cough was thought to be a childhood disease. Anyone can get whooping cough, but it generally happens more often in infants, children, and older children. Infants younger than 2 months of age, who are too young to receive the vaccine, are especially at risk. Whooping cough is milder in adults and can occur in those whose immunity has worn off. Whooping cough vs. croup Whooping cough and croup are both infections of the respiratory tract. Croup is a viral infection, while whooping cough is caused by bacteria. Croup usually runs for a shorter time frame and goes away on its own. Also, there is no vaccine for croup, and it can't be treated with antibiotics. The sounds of the coughs, which are a symptom of both conditions, are also different. Whooping cough can come with a gasping or “whooping” sound, while croup usually causes a barking cough. Whooping cough (also known as pertussis) is a bacterial infection that causes long stretches of severe coughs that sometimes end with a whooping sound. It spreads easily, but vaccines like DTaP for infants and children and Tdap for older children and adults can help prevent it. (Photo credit: E+/Getty Images) Whooping Cough Symptoms At first, whooping cough has the same symptoms as the average cold : Mild coughing Sneezing Runny nose Low fever (below 102 F) You may also have diarrhea early on. After about 7-10 days, the cough turns into “ coughing spells” that may end with a whooping sound as the person tries to breathe in air. Because the cough is dry and doesn't produce mucus , these spells can last up to 1 minute. Sometimes, it can cause your face to briefly turn red or purple. Most people with whooping cough have coughing spells, but not everyone does. Infants may not make the whooping sound or even cough, but they might gasp for air or try to catch their breath during these spells. Some may vomit. Sometimes, adults with the condition just have a cough that won’t go away. You may notice fewer symptoms after 4 weeks, but coughing bouts can come back and continue for months after symptoms start. It may last 10 weeks or more. Whooping cough sound Coughing for a long time causes you to have to take in air that you've lost. If you have whooping cough, you'll gasp after a coughing episode, which can create a whooping sound. You can still, however, have the infection without the noise. What Causes Whooping Cough? A type of bacteria called Bordetella pertussis causes whooping cough. If a person with whooping cough sneezes, laughs, or coughs, small droplets that contain this bacteria may fly through the air. You might get sick if you breathe in the droplets. When the bacteria get into your airways, they attach to the tiny hairs in the linings of the lungs . The bacteria cause swelling and inflammation , which lead to a dry, long-lasting cough and other cold-like symptoms. Can adults get whooping cough? Anyone can get whooping cough, including adults. In adults, whooping cough usually occurs in those who haven't received the vaccine or whose immunity has worn off. They also tend to have milder symptoms than children, especially those adults who've received the vaccine. Whooping cough risk factors Whooping cough can cause anyone at any age to get sick. The vaccine you received as a child wears off, so older children and adults who haven't gotten the vaccine since childhood are at risk of whooping cough. Also, because babies do not receive the vaccine until they are 2 months old, they are at risk from birth until they are vaccinated. You can get sick from it even if you've already been vaccinated, but that's not likely. If you do get whooping cough despite being vaccinated, you usually: Have symptoms that are milder and for a shorter time Have fewer coughing episodes with the whooping sound Whooping Cough Complications Whooping cough is dangerous for babies, especially those who are younger than 1 year old because it can keep them from getting the oxygen they need. This can cause: Brain damage or bleeding on the brain Pneumonia Seizures Apnea Convulsions If you think your infant might have it, see their doctor right away. Children under the age of 12 months with whooping cough should be watched at all times because the coughing spells can make them stop breathing or lead to other complications. Young babies with bad cases may need hospital care, too. Help protect your child by making sure they and any adult who's around them often get vaccinated. In teens and adults, whooping cough can lead to pneumonia. Severe coughing can also cause: Abdominal hernias Broken blood vessels Bruised ribs Trouble controlling when you pee Trouble sleeping Whooping Cough Diagnosis Because symptoms of whooping cough are a lot like those caused by a cold, the flu, or bronchitis, it can be hard to diagnose it early on. Your doctor may be able to tell that you have it by the sound of your cough, but tests can confirm it. Nose or throat culture. A simple swab of the area where your nose and throat meet can be tested for the bacteria that causes whooping cough. Blood test. A high white blood cell count is a sign that your body is fighting off an infection, but it doesn’t necessarily mean it’s whooping cough. Chest X-ray. An x-ray can show if you have inflammation or fluid in your lungs, which can be a sign of pneumonia. Whooping Cough Treatment and Home Remedies If you find out you have whooping cough early on, antibiotics can help cut down coughing and other symptoms. They can also help prevent the infection from spreading to others. But most people are diagnosed too late for antibiotics to work well. Don't use over-the-counter cough medicines, cough suppressants , or expectorants (medicines that make you cough up mucus ) to treat whooping cough. They don't work. If your coughing spells are so bad that they keep you from drinking enough fluids, you can get dehydrated. If this happens, call your doctor right away. Home remedies You can do a few things to feel better and recover faster: Get lots of rest. This can give your body more strength to fight the illness. Eat small meals as often as you feel up to it. Eating smaller, more frequent meals can help prevent the vomiting that may result from harsh coughing spells. Clean air. Keeping the air around you free of dust, smoke, and other irritants can help soothe coughing. Drink fluids. Stay hydrated by drinking lots of water or juice. If you notice signs of dehydration, such as dry lips or peeing less often, call your doctor right away. Whooping Cough Prevention Vaccines and other preventative medications can reduce the risk of spreading the infection. Whooping cough vaccine The DTaP vaccine can help protect children from whooping cough. Starting at 2 months, infants should get a dose every other month for the first 6 months, another between 15 and 18 months, and then one last time between ages 4 and 6. Older children and adults need the Tdap vaccine and a booster every 10 years because the vaccine can weaken over time. The best age for preteens to get it is between 11 and 12. Adults who’ve never had the vaccine can get it anytime and should receive a Tdap or Td booster every 10 years or after 5 years if they have a serious burn or wound. Pregnant women should get a booster during each pregnancy to help protect their newborn. The CDC recommends this during the early part of the third trimester. Some possible side effects from the vaccination include: Itching, swelling, or redness at the injection site Fever Headache Tiredness Upset stomach or vomiting Feeling nauseous Diarrhea Preventative medications Another important key to prevention is to protect the people around you. If someone in your household has whooping cough, make sure they cover their mouth or cough into their elbow to prevent the bacteria from spreading. Make sure they wash their hands often, and consider having them wear a mask when they’re near others. If you've been exposed to whooping cough, your doctor may prescribe an antibiotic to help prevent infection, particularly if: You're pregnant You live with someone who is at a high risk of having severe complications or who has whooping cough You're a health care provider You have a condition that puts you at risk for severe complications You are younger than 12 months of age Whooping Cough Outlook If you have whooping cough, you'll usually have cold symptoms for up to 2 weeks and then 10 weeks or more of coughing fits. Within another few weeks, you should slowly start to feel better as your symptoms improve. The recovery time for some may be months. Takeaways Whooping cough, also known as pertussis, is a very contagious bacterial infection of your nose and throat, or your respiratory tract. It causes long stretches of severe coughs that sometimes end with a whooping sound. The symptoms can persist for a few weeks to several months. Infants under 2 months of age are most at risk because they can't get vaccinated against whooping cough, but it also happens in older children and adults whose immunity has worn off. If you have symptoms that are similar to those of a cold, continue for more than a week, and come with coughing spells, talk to your doctor. Your doctor can prescribe antibiotics if the condition is caught early. Whooping Cough FAQs Will whooping cough go away on its own? Whooping cough is usually treated with antibiotics, and it's recommended to get treatment early to keep it from spreading and to keep your symptoms from getting severe. After having whooping cough for 3 weeks without treatment, antibiotics may not help because the bacteria is already out of your system. Your symptoms may last for months. How serious is whooping cough in adults? Symptoms from whooping cough tend to be milder in adults, especially those who have received the vaccine. Teenagers and adults can have severe cases and even serious complications, especially those who aren't vaccinated. Is whooping cough dry or wet? The cough that comes with whooping cough is dry, causes irritation, and leads to coughing fits. What does a pertussis cough sound like in adults? The “whoop ” in whooping cough is usually not present in milder cases of pertussis, and adults usually don't have severe symptoms."
20,What Is Prader-Willi Syndrome?,"Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare, complicated condition that affects many parts of your body. It stems from a problem with one of your chromosomes (a strand of DNA that carries your genes). It can cause physical issues, like extreme hunger and weak muscles, as well as learning and behavioral problems. Only about 1 in 10,000 to 30,000 people in the world have PWS. Causes PWS usually happens because of genetic changes on a region of chromosome 15. There's no way to prevent it. But if you plan to have a baby, you and your partner can be screened for PWS risk. A head or brain injury can also cause the syndrome. Signs and Symptoms A baby may show signs of PWS early on. They may have almond-shaped eyes , their head may get narrow at the temples, their mouth might turn down at the corners, and they might have a thin upper lip. He also may have these symptoms: Poor muscle tone or limbs that hang loosely when you hold them Inability to suck or nurse well, so they gain weight slowly Eyes that cross or wander Appearance of being tired all the time Weak or soft cry Poor response to you In early childhood, kids with PWS start to show other signs. It affects a part of their brain called the hypothalamus -- this is what tells you you're full when you eat enough food. People with PWS don't get the feeling of being full, so the most common signs are nonstop hunger and weight gain. A child with PWS may always want more food, eat big portions , or try to hide or store food to eat later. Some kids even eat food that's still frozen or in the garbage. Your child may also: Be short for their age Have small hands or feet Have extra body fat and not enough muscle mass Have sex organs that may not develop Have mild to moderate learning problems Be slow to learn to talk, sit, stand, or walk Have temper tantrums Pick at their skin Have sleep problems Have mood and speech problems Have scoliosis -- a curved spine Have too little thyroid or growth hormones These signs of PWS are less common, but some people have them: Vision problems, like being nearsighted Lighter skin and hair color than the rest of the family High tolerance for pain Inability to keep body temperature under control during a fever or in a hot or cold place Thick saliva that can cause tooth decay or other problems Osteoporosis, or thin, weak bones that break easily Because their sex organs don't develop, women with PWS may never get a period. Or they may start their periods much later than others. Men who have PWS may not have facial hair. They may have small sex organs, and their voices may not change in puberty. People who have PWS usually aren't able to have children. Diagnosis Your doctor can usually diagnose PWS with a blood test called a chromosomal analysis. This shows if there's a problem with the gene that can cause PWS. Treatments There's no cure, but if you have a child with PWS, you can help them stay at a healthy weight, have a good quality of life, and prevent health problems down the road. Their treatment will depend on the symptoms. Babies : High-calorie formula may help an infant stay at a healthy weight if they can't eat well because of weak muscle tone. You also can use special nipples or a Gavage feeding tube, which puts breast milk or formula directly in your baby's stomach , to make sure they get enough food. Older kids and teens: Set clear limits on how and when your child eats to avoid too much weight gain. A low-calorie, balanced diet and lots of exercise can help them stay at a healthy weight. Some kids with PWS may need to take extra vitamin D or calcium . If your child tries to grab and hide food, you might lock cabinets, the pantry, or the refrigerator. For teens with PWS, hormones like testosterone, estrogen , or human growth hormone (HGH) may help with small stature, poor muscle tone, or extra body fat. Hormone replacement may build stronger bones and prevent osteoporosis later on. Antidepressants , like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), may help ease behavior problems caused by PWS. Specialized therapy can help your child deal with sleep apnea, thyroid issues, and other symptoms common to this condition. Kids with PWS should get regular eye exams to check for vision problems. Your child's doctor should screen for scoliosis, hip dysplasia, or thyroid problems . The Prader-Willi Syndrome Association has online support groups and tips for parents."
21,Wilms Tumor,"What Is Wilms Tumor? A Wilms tumor (also called a nephroblastoma) is the most common kidney cancer in children. Most children with it have a tumor on one kidney , but about 5% get a tumor on both. The reasons aren’t clear, but it most often affects kids who are 3 to 4 years old. It’s much less common after age 5. Doctors are getting better at spotting and treating this type of cancer , so many children who have it will make a full recovery. Wilms Tumor Symptoms Some children who have a Wilms tumor won’t notice symptoms. Others may have: Belly pain Swelling in their belly A growth that you can see or feel in their belly Fever Nausea Lack of appetite High blood pressure Blood in their pee Constipation Shortness of breath Many Wilms tumors get very big before anyone notices them. They’re sometimes the only sign of the disease. The average size is 1 pound. Wilms Tumor Causes All cancer s happen when cells in your body start to grow out of control. If your child has a Wilms tumor, their kidney cells didn’t grow like they should have. Instead, they turned into cancer cells. Most of the time, this is because of a random change in a gene. Rarely, it’s because of gene changes handed down from a parent. Wilms Tumor Risk Factors Things that might make a child more likely to have a Wilms tumor include: Age. Most children who get this type of cancer are between 3 and 5 years old. Gender. Girls are more likely to have it than boys. Race. Black children are slightly more likely to get a Wilms tumor than children of other races. Family history . If someone in your family has had a Wilms tumor, the odds are higher that your child will get it, too. Birth defects . These can include: Testicles that haven’t dropped (cryptorchidism) The opening of the penis is on the underside instead of on the tip (hypospadias) A total or partial lack of the colored area of the eye (aniridia) An oversized arm or leg (hemihyphertrophy) Another health condition. A Wilms tumor sometimes happens in children who have other rare conditions: WAGR syndrome causes problems in the urinary tract. Boys with Denys- Drash syndrome have testicles but also have female traits. Microcephaly is when a baby is born with an unusually small head. Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome causes internal organs that are larger than usual. Types of Wilms Tumors There are two kinds of Wilms tumors, divided by how the cells look under a microscope. Favorable histology. More than 9 out of 10 Wilms tumors fall into this group. It means there isn’t a lot of difference among the cancer cells. Children with this type have a good chance of being cured. Unfavorable or anaplastic histology. This type has a variety of deformed cancer cells. It can be much harder to cure. Wilms Tumor Diagnosis Your child’s medical appointment will probably include: A physical exam and medical history. Your doctor will ask about the symptoms and whether cancer or urinary tract problems run in your family. A blood test to check how well your child's kidneys and liver are working, their red and white blood cells, and their blood clotting. A urine test to look for blood Imaging tests like an ultrasound, MRI, or CT scan of your child’s belly If the doctor finds a tumor in your child’s kidney, they may: Take a small sample to look at under a microscope (biopsy) Order more imaging tests to find out whether the disease has spread Do a bone scan to look for diseased bone Wilms Tumor Staging Your doctor will use test results to figure out how far a tumor has spread. This is called staging. The stages of a Wilms tumor are: Stage I. It’s in only one kidney. Surgery can remove it all. Stage II. Cancer has moved into the area around the kidney, but surgery can remove it all. Stage III. Cancer hasn’t spread outside the child’s abdomen. Surgery can’t remove it all. Stage IV. Cancer has spread to parts of the body that are farther away, like the lungs, bones, or brain, or to lymph nodes outside the belly. Stage V. There are tumors in both kidneys. Wilms Tumor Treatment How a Wilms tumor is treated depends on how much the cancer has spread. It can include surgery, chemotherapy , and radiation therapy . Surgery If your doctor operates, they may do one of these procedures: Partial nephrectomy. This removes the tumor and some healthy tissue around it. Radical nephrectomy. This removes the affected kidney, the ureter (the tube that carries pee away from the kidney), the adrenal gland on top of the kidney, and nearby tissue. Removal of both kidneys. In some cases, the doctor will need to take out both kidneys. Your child would then need to have dialysis, using a machine to filter waste out of their blood. Once they’re healthy enough, they might have a kidney transplant. Chemotherapy Certain medications can fight or kill cancer cells inside your child’s body. Most children who have Wilms tumors will get chemo at some point during treatment. These drugs can also affect healthy cells, leading to side effects including: Hair loss Fatigue Mouth sores Loss of appetite Nausea and vomiting Diarrhea or constipation Bruising or bleeding easier than usual Higher chances of infection Your medical team will often be able to manage side effects. Radiation Strong radiation can also kill cancer cells. A machine focuses it onto the cancer. Doctors tend to use radiation for tumors that are stage III and above. But it can also have short-term and long-term side effects, including tissue damage, so they’ll use as little as possible. Wilms Tumor Outlook The outlook for most kids with a Wilms tumor is good. Up to 90% of children who have a tumor with favorable histology can be cured. If the tumor has unfavorable histology, the cure rate is lower. Once cancer treatment ends, your child will have regular doctor visits to make sure they stay healthy. If there’s something you don’t understand, make sure to ask your doctor. This will help you know how to best to support your child."
22,Seasonal Depression (Seasonal Affective Disorder),"Do the winter months get you down more than you think they should? If so, you might have seasonal depression , also known as seasonal affective disorder (SAD). Seasonal depression is a mood disorder that happens every year at the same time. A rare form of seasonal depression, known as ""summer depression ,"" begins in late spring or early summer and ends in fall. In general, though, seasonal affective disorder starts in fall or winter and ends in spring or early summer. SAD may affect 11 million people in the U.S. each year, and 25 million more may have a milder form called the winter blues. Causes While we don't know the exact causes of SAD, some scientists think that certain hormones made deep in the brain trigger attitude-related changes at certain times of year. Experts believe that SAD may be related to these hormonal changes. One theory is that less sunlight during fall and winter leads to the brain making less serotonin, a chemical linked to brain pathways that regulate mood. When nerve cell pathways in the brain that regulate mood don't work the way they should, the result can be feelings of depression , along with symptoms of fatigue and weight gain . SAD usually starts in young adulthood and is more common in women than men. Some people with SAD have mild symptoms and feel out of sorts or cranky. Others have worse symptoms that interfere with relationships and work. Because the lack of enough daylight during wintertime is related to SAD, it's less often found in countries where there's plenty of sunshine year-round. Winter Symptoms People with SAD typically sleep much more than usual and crave carbohydrates. They also have many of the normal warning signs of depression , including: Feeling sad, cranky, or hopeless Less energy Trouble concentrating Fatigue Greater appetite More desire to be alone Thoughts of suicide Weight gain Summer Symptoms Less appetite Trouble sleeping Weight loss Diagnosis The main feature of SAD is that your mood and behavior shift along with the calendar. It’s not a separate mood disorder but a type of major depression or bipolar disorder , sometimes called manic depression . You may have SAD if, for the past 2 years, you: Had depression or mania that starts as well as ends during a specific season You didn’t feel these symptoms during your “normal” seasons Over your lifetime, you’ve had more seasons with than without depression or mania It sometimes might take a while to diagnose SAD because it can mimic other conditions, like chronic fatigue syndrome , underactive thyroid , low blood sugar , viral illnesses, or other mood disorders. Treatment Treatments differ, depending on how severe your symptoms are. The type of treatment you get also depends on whether you have another type of depression or bipolar disorder. Traditional antidepressants are often used to treat seasonal depression. Bupropion XL is currently the only medication that is FDA-approved specifically to prevent major depressive episodes in people with SAD. Many doctors recommend that people with SAD get outside early in the morning to get more natural light. If this is impossible because of the dark winter months, antidepressant medications or light therapy (phototherapy) may help. Low levels of vitamin D, caused by low dietary intake of the vitamin or not enough exposure to sunshine, have been found in people with SAD. However, it's unclear whether vitamin D supplementation can help to relieve SAD symptoms. Very little research has been done on dietary supplements other than vitamin D for SAD. Light Therapy Some researchers link seasonal depression to the natural hormone melatonin , which causes drowsiness. Light affects the biological clock in our brains that regulates circadian rhythms, a physiological function that may include mood changes when there’s less sunlight in winter. Natural or ""full-spectrum"" light can have an antidepressant effect. A full-spectrum bright light shines indirectly into your eyes . You sit about 2 feet away from a bright light -- about 20 times brighter than normal room lighting. The therapy starts with one 10- to 15-minute session per day. Then the times increase to 30 to 45 minutes a day, depending on your response. Don't look directly at the light source of any light box for long times, to avoid possible damage to your eyes . Some people with SAD recover within days of using light therapy. Others take much longer. If the SAD symptoms don't go away, your doctor may increase the light therapy sessions to twice daily. People who respond to light therapy are encouraged to continue it until they can be out in the sunshine again in the springtime. While side effects are minimal, be cautious if you have sensitive skin or a history of bipolar disorder . Prevention Spend some time outside every day, even when it's cloudy. The effects of daylight still help. If it’s too cold out, open your blinds and sit by a sunny window. Begin using a 10,000-lux light box when fall starts, even before you feel the effects of winter SAD. Eat a well- balanced diet . This will help you have more energy, even if you're craving starchy and sweet foods. Exercise for 30 minutes a day, five times a week. Stay involved with your social circle and regular activities. Social support is very important. When Should I Call my Doctor? If you feel depressed, fatigued, and cranky the same time each year, and these feelings seem to be seasonal in nature, you may have a form of SAD. Talk openly with your doctor about your feelings. Follow their recommendations for lifestyle changes and treatment. If your doctor recommends light therapy, ask if the practice provides light boxes for patients with SAD. You can also rent or purchase a light box, but they're expensive, and health insurance companies don't usually cover them."
23,Dental Health and Wisdom Teeth,"Wisdom teeth are the third and final set of molars that most people get in their late teens or early twenties. Sometimes these teeth can be a valuable asset to the mouth when healthy and properly aligned, but more often, they are misaligned and require removal. When wisdom teeth are misaligned, they may position themselves horizontally, be angled toward or away from the second molars, or be angled inward or outward. Poor alignment of wisdom teeth can crowd or damage adjacent teeth, the jawbone, or nerves. Wisdom teeth also can be impacted -- they are enclosed within the soft tissue and/or the jawbone or only partially break through or erupt through the gum. Partial eruption of the wisdom teeth allows an opening for bacteria to enter around the tooth and cause an infection, which results in pain, swelling, jaw stiffness, and general illness. Partially erupted teeth are also more prone to tooth decay and gum disease, because their hard-to-reach location and awkward positioning makes brushing and flossing difficult. How Do I Know If I Have Wisdom Teeth? Ask your dentist about the positioning of your wisdom teeth. They may take an X-ray periodically to evaluate for the presence and alignment of your wisdom teeth. Your dentist may also decide to send you to an oral surgeon for further evaluation. Your dentist or oral surgeon may recommend that your wisdom teeth be extracted even before problems develop. This is done to avoid a more painful or more complicated extraction that might have to be done a few years later. Removal is easier in young people, when the wisdom teeth roots are not yet fully developed and the bone is less dense. In older people, recovery and healing time tend to be longer. How Are Wisdom Teeth Removed? The relative ease at which your dentist or oral surgeon can extract your wisdom teeth depends on their position and stage of development. Your oral health care provider will be able to give you an idea of what to expect during your pre-extraction exam. A wisdom tooth that is fully erupted through the gum can be extracted as easily as any other tooth. However, a wisdom tooth that is underneath the gums and embedded in the jawbone will require an incision into the gums and then removal of the portion of bone that lies over the tooth. Often, for a tooth in this situation, the tooth will be extracted in small sections rather than removed in one piece to minimize the amount of bone that needs to be removed to get the tooth out. What Happens During Wisdom Teeth Removal? Before your wisdom teeth are pulled, the teeth and the surrounding tissue will be numbed with a local anesthetic -- the same type used to numb a tooth prior to having a cavity filled. In addition to the local anesthetic to numb the pain, you and your dentist or oral surgeon may decide that a sedative is desired to control any anxiety. Sedating medications that could be selected include: nitrous oxide (otherwise known as ""laughing gas""), an oral sedative (for example, Valium ), or an intravenous sedative (administered via an injection into your veins). If nitrous oxide is given, you will be able to drive yourself home. If any of the other medications is selected, you will need someone to drive you both to and from the appointment. What Does Recovery Involve After Wisdom Teeth Are Pulled? After having your wisdom teeth removed, the speed of your recovery depends on the degree of difficulty of the extraction (a simple extraction of a fully erupted tooth versus a tooth impacted into the jawbone). In general, here's what to expect. During the first 24 hours Bleeding may occur for several hours after tooth extraction . To control it, position a piece of clean moist gauze over the empty tooth socket and bite down firmly. Apply constant pressure for about 45 minutes. A moistened tea bag is an effective alternative. The tannic acid in tea helps healing blood clots to form (blood clots function similarly to scab over an open wound). Repeat this process if a small degree of bleeding continues; if heavy bleeding continues to occur, contact your dentist or oral surgeon. Avoid rinsing or spitting for 24 hours after tooth extraction, avoid ""sucking"" actions (for example, don't drink beverages through straws or smoke) and avoid hot liquids (such as coffee or soup). These activities can dislodge the clot, causing a dry socket (see below) to develop. Facial swelling in the area where the tooth was extracted typically occurs. To minimize swelling, place a piece of ice, wrapped in a cloth, on that area of your face on a schedule of 10 minutes on, followed by 20 minutes off. Repeat as necessary during this first 24-hour period. Pain medications , such as acetaminophen ( Tylenol ) or ibuprofen ( Motrin or Advil ), can be taken for minor pain. Your dentist or oral surgeon may prescribe more potent pain relievers, if necessary. Antibiotics that may have been prescribed prior to tooth extraction (to treat any active infection around the wisdom tooth to be extracted) should continue to be taken until the full prescription is gone. Foods should be restricted to a liquid diet until all the numbness from anesthesia has worn off. Eat soft foods for a few days. Also avoid alcohol if you're also taking narcotic pain medication. Continue to brush your teeth , but avoid the teeth directly neighboring the extracted tooth during the first 24 hours. On day two, resume the gentle brushing of your teeth. Do not use commercial mouth rinses -- these can irritate the extraction site. After 24 hours Facial swelling in the area of the tooth extraction should be treated with heat after the first 24 hours of ice. Apply a moist warm towel to the area on a 20-minute on, 20-minute off schedule. Repeat as necessary. Keep in mind that swelling usually peaks 2 to 3 days after the procedure. Rinse your mouth with warm salt water (1/2 teaspoon of salt in a cup of warm water) after meals and before bed. Do not use commercial mouth rinses unless your dentist directs you to. Stitches , if used and if not of the self-dissolving type, need to be removed by your oral health care provider in about 1 week. If you do require stitches, ask what type you have been given. Watch for signs of dry socket (described below). This condition requires treatment by your oral health care provider. Complete healing doesn't occur for a few weeks to a few months following the extraction. However, usually within the first week or two, enough healing has taken place for use of your mouth to be reasonably comfortable in the area of the extraction. Your dentist will explain what to expect in your specific case. What Are Potential Complications of Wisdom Tooth Removal? Two of the more important complications after having your wisdom teeth removed include: Dry socket. Dry socket is a common complication that occurs when either a blood clot has failed to form in the extracted tooth socket or else the blood clot that did form has been dislodged. Without clot formation, healing will be delayed. When it happens, dry socket typically occurs 3 or 4 days following the extraction and is accompanied by pain (ranging from ""dull"" to moderate to severe) and a foul mouth odor. Your dentist or oral surgeon will treat the dry socket by placing medication in the socket. Paresthesia. Paresthesia is a rarer complication of wisdom teeth extraction. Wisdom teeth entrapped in the jawbone are often close to nerves. Sometimes these nerves can be bruised or damaged during the tooth removal process. The result is a numbness (called a paresthesia) of the tongue , lip, or chin that can last a few days, weeks, months, or may even be permanent. How Much Does Wisdom Teeth Extraction Cost? Simple extraction of a wisdom tooth can cost as little as $99 per tooth. The cost of wisdom teeth that are impacted can cost between $230 and $340 and even more. Because costs vary in different areas of the country, contact your dentist or oral surgeon for their charges. Also, check with both your dental insurance carrier and medical insurance provider. One or the other type of insurance may cover a portion of the cost of wisdom teeth removal."
24,Advance Directives,"Most people do not want to think about death and dying -- so they don't. Until they have to. Unfortunately, that often means that families are left struggling with difficult decisions about important matters, such as whether or not Mom would like to be kept alive using a ventilator, or who should be in charge of managing Dad's financial affairs, because Mom or Dad never made clear what they wanted for themselves. Advance directives are important tools for anyone to have, because even the healthiest person could experience a sudden accident and not be able to speak for herself. But when you have a life-threatening illness, it's particularly critical to make clear, in writing, what your wishes are should the time come when you can't express them yourself. There are two primary kinds of advance directives: A living will spells out your preferences about certain kinds of life-sustaining treatments. For example, you can indicate whether you do or do not want interventions such as cardiac resuscitation, tube feeding, and mechanical respiration. A power of attorney directive names someone that you trust to act as your agent if you are unable to speak for yourself. If you want to choose one person to speak for you on healthcare matters, and someone else to make financial decisions, you can do separate financial and healthcare powers of attorney. A power of attorney may be more flexible, since it's impossible to predict all the medical decisions that might come up in the future and spell out your exact preferences for all of these situations. Many states actually combine the living will and power of attorney into one ""advance directive"" form. You should only assign someone power of attorney to make your medical decisions if you have someone you trust to carry out your wishes. For example, your husband or daughter might find it painful to comply with your preference not to have a breathing tube inserted. Thinking About a Living Will When you do choose a medical power of attorney, you will probably want to put some specific things in writing as to the kind of care you would want should you not be able to express your wishes directly. Some things to think about: Do you want all pain relief options available, even if they may have the side effect of unintentionally hastening your death? Which life-sustaining options -- such as tube feeding, mechanical ventilation, CPR, and antibiotics -- do you want, and which would you not want? How long would you want these options to be continued if your condition is not improving? Would you want artificial life support removed if you are found to be irreversibly brain dead, or do you prefer that your life be sustained until your heart stops on its own? What are your feelings about organ donation ? How do you want your body to be disposed of after death? (Burial, cremation, medical research?) Which funeral home or other organization do you want to handle the arrangements? Each state has its own form for advance directives, giving you questions to answer and specific things that you can choose to accept or reject, but you can always add additional information about your wishes if the form does not include everything you're concerned about. Choosing a Medical Power of Attorney If you decide to choose a medical power of attorney, here are some things to look for: Someone who is not intimidated by medical professionals and is willing to ask challenging questions Someone who can put aside their own feelings about a particular procedure or medical option in order to ensure that your wishes are carried out Someone who understands your wishes about medical options and end-of-life care You might also want to think about an alternate power of attorney if your first choice is unable to carry out the job. Once you choose a medical power of attorney, continue talking with them on an ongoing basis about possible situations that might occur, and how you would want them handled. Although you cannot anticipate every possibility, the more you talk with this person about your wishes in general, the better they will understand your overall desires about care at the end of your life. Here are some possibilities you may want to discuss: How do you feel about being fed or hydrated through a tube? Would you want to receive certain treatments, like antibiotics , tube feeding, or mechanical ventilation, for a trial period and have them stopped if a certain time passed with no improvement? How aggressive do you want your doctors to be about the use of CPR should your heart stop? What are you most afraid of regarding treatments you might receive? What are you afraid might happen if you can't make decisions for yourself? Are there circumstances under which you would want more aggressive measures taken to sustain your life, and others under which you wouldn't? Making It Legal Whether you write a living will, choose a medical power of attorney, or both, you will need to make those decisions legally binding, in writing. There are state-specific forms for advance directives like these; you do not need an attorney to prepare them. You can download the forms you need. Each state's form is different, so be sure to use the correct form for your state. You will generally need to have your form witnessed and/or notarized, so take careful note of the requirements for your state. Once you have completed your advance directive, you should ensure that everyone involved in your care has a copy and is aware of it: your doctor, your hospital, your hospice or palliative care team, important family members, and your attorney if you have one."
25,What is Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome?,"Does your heart sometimes beat very fast? Have you ever felt it skip a beat? This is called palpitations . It feels strange but is usually harmless. In some people, though, it could be a sign of a problem. Heart palpitations are one possible symptom of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. It is a rare condition of irregular heartbeat, or arrhythmia . The heart has an electrical system that works a certain way. Signals travel in an exact pattern from the upper to the lower chambers of the heart. This system keeps the heart beating regularly. People with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome have an extra electrical pathway. It causes the abnormal heartbeats. And it could lead to a very serious arrhythmia called supraventricular tachycardia. This is when the ventricles (the heart’s lower chambers) beat very quickly. Causes Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome is a congenital heart defect, something you're born with. Parents can pass it down to their children. But most times it happens randomly and doesn’t run in families. If you have this condition, you also might have other heart problems. Even when you’re born with the syndrome, you may not find out you have it until you’re in your teens or older. Symptoms Some people have symptoms and some do not. You may have the following: Dizziness or feeling light-headed Palpitations or feeling your heart flutter or beat harder Loss of consciousness Trouble breathing or shortness of breath Diagnosis Your doctor will recommend that you see a cardiologist or heart specialist. The specialist will ask you a lot of questions about past and current heart-related symptoms. They will give you a thorough physical exam that includes checking your heart rate and blood pressure. You may have diagnostic tests to check your heart. They might include: Electrocardiography to check the electrical activity of your heart. Holter monitoring to check your heart over a longer period of time. You’ll wear a monitor that records your heart rhythm for 24 hours or more. Electrophysiological studies to locate and learn more about your arrhythmia. Treatment You may not need to take any medicine if you don’t have symptoms. In that case, you might just need regular follow-up visits and tests. If you do have heart rhythm problems, your doctor may give you a prescription for medicine to control it. If medicines aren’t enough, your doctor may recommend a procedure called catheter ablation. This is a procedure a doctor does to get rid of the areas of heart tissue that cause the irregular beats. If it doesn’t work, or only helps a little, they can do it again, and there are also other treatments they can try. Living with It If you have only slight symptoms, or none, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome won’t affect your life, except for the extra checkups. But some symptoms may pose challenges. For example, if you tend to faint because of the condition, you may not be able to drive a car or take part in other activities. How well you’ll do depends a lot on the type of arrhythmia you have and how often it happens. That’s why it’s so important to see your doctor and get scheduled for tests."
26,Women and Heart Disease,"The risk of heart disease in women goes up with age. It’s the leading cause of death in women over age 40, especially after menopause. Each year, more than 400,000 U.S. women die of heart disease . This translates to approximately one death every minute. Why Is Heart Disease Associated With Menopause? Menopause is a normal stage in a woman's life. It’s the changes women feel either before or after they stop having their period. It usually happens between the ages of 45 and 55. The ovaries gradually make less estrogen , a female hormone. This causes changes in the menstrual cycle . It also brings other physical changes like: Hot flashes Night sweats Emotional changes Changes in the vagina (such as dryness) Women can also lose estrogen if the ovaries are removed during surgery (such as during a total hysterectomy ), by taking certain medications , or if a woman goes through early menopause. The loss of natural estrogen as women get older may play a part in the higher risks of heart disease seen after menopause. Other things that may lead to risks of heart disease then include: Changes in the walls of the blood vessels, making it more likely for plaque and blood clots to form.

27,Sprained Ankle: What’s the Treatment?,"To help your sprained ankle heal, you’ll need to ease the pain and bring down the swelling. Make an appointment right away for any ankle sprain, mild or severe. Your doctor will examine you and let you know if something more serious is wrong with your ankle. Go to the emergency room if you have any of the following symptoms: Severe pain, bruising, or severe swelling Bleeding, numbness, or change in color of the affected area Your ankle looks deformed or seems dislocated You can't put any weight on it Control Swelling If your ankle is painful and swollen, remove ankle bracelets or toe rings right away. Then try the “RICE” method to ease your symptoms. RICE stands for “rest, ice, compress, and elevate.” Here’s how it works: Rest the ankle (use crutches if needed) Ice the ankle for 20 to 30 minutes every 2 to 3 hours for the first 2 days Compress (wrap) the ankle lightly -- not tightly -- with an elastic bandage or ankle brace For the first 48 hours, elevate (raise) the ankle higher than your heart whenever you're lying down How Do I Wrap My Ankle? Take the compression wrap out of the packaging and unroll it. Place a small section of the cloth just behind your toes and begin to wrap it in a spiral toward your heart. Each layer should cover about half the width of the previous one. Continue wrapping around the foot, heel, and ankle until every bit of skin -- up to several inches above the injury -- is covered. If you still have pain and swelling, ask your doctor about over-the-counter pain relievers. Don’t give aspirin to anyone under age 19."
