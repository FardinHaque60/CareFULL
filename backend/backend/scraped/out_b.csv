0,What Is Babesiosis?,"Babesiosis is a rare and life-threatening infection of the red blood cells that's usually spread by ticks . It's caused by tiny parasites called Babesia. The kind that most often affects humans is called Babesia microti . They enter your bloodstream when you're bitten by an infected deer tick. Other ways babesiosis can spread include: Contaminated blood transfusions A pregnant , infected mother passing it to their baby in the womb or during birth Babesiosis usually happens in the warmer months. Ticks carrying the parasite have been found in: Block Island, R.I. Fire Island, Shelter Island, and eastern Long Island, N.Y. Martha's Vineyard, Mass. Nantucket, Mass. Coastal areas of New Jersey People have gotten this infection in other states, too, including: California Connecticut Delaware Maine Minnesota Wisconsin It's also been seen in Europe. Symptoms Signs of babesiosis start 1 to 8 weeks after you come in contact with the parasite that causes the disease. Sometimes you won't notice any symptoms. If you do, they might include: Body aches Chills Fatigue Fever Headache Loss of appetite Sweating You also can get a condition called hemolytic anemia in which your red blood cells die faster than your body can make new ones. Symptoms of this can include: Confusion Dark-colored urine Dizziness Heart murmur Rapid heart rate Swelling of your spleen and liver Very pale skin Weakness Yellow skin, eyes , and mouth ( jaundice ) Symptoms can be worse if you're elderly, no longer have your spleen, or have a health condition or take medications that weaken your immune system . If you notice any of these symptoms, see your doctor and be sure to tell them if you've traveled recently. Ticks can be the size of a poppy seed, so you may not know if you've been bitten by one. Diagnosis Your doctor will order blood tests to check for signs of infection. This includes looking for Babesia in the blood under a microscope. They may also want to do other blood tests to rule out conditions with similar symptoms, such as anaplasmosis or Lyme disease , which is also caused by ticks. It's possible to have Lyme disease at the same time as babesiosis. Treatment and Prevention If you don't have any symptoms, you probably won't need treatment. If you do, your doctor may prescribe a drug called atovaquone that kills microorganisms along with the antibiotic azithromycin .  Another combination they may recommend is quinine with the antibiotic clindamycin. The ticks that cause babesiosis typically have to stay on your body for 36 to 48 hours to cause an infection. Here are some ways to prevent one: Stay away from overgrown grasses and leaf piles, where ticks are likely to be. Wear long pants tucked into your socks and a long-sleeve shirt when you're near where ticks thrive. Wear light-colored clothes so you can easily spot ticks. Use bug repellant that has DEET in it on your skin and clothing. Before going indoors, check your clothing and pets for ticks. Once inside, check your entire body for ticks using a full-length or hand-held mirror. Remove any ticks with pointed tweezers."
1,"Baby Maintenance: Baths, Nails, and Hair","Unfortunately for new parents, babies don't come with instruction manuals. So when it comes to new parenting tasks, such as baths and nail trimming, some parents feel nervous or confused. If you're unsure about these baby grooming basics, here's a handy guide to help you make hygiene as easy as loving your baby. Always keep a hand on your baby during bath time. Have any supplies you may need within reach. (Photo credit: Westend61/Getty Images) Baby Baths Baby sponge bath Until your baby's umbilical cord falls off, which usually happens after the first week, don't give them any baths. Instead, give your baby a sponge wash. Circumcised boys should not be bathed until the penis has totally healed. Here's how: Pick a warm room with a flat surface, such as a bathroom, a kitchen counter, a changing table, or a bed. Cover the surface with a thick towel. Make sure the room temperature is at least 75 F. Assemble all the baby bath products you will need: Baby bath sponge or clean washcloth (double-rinsed) Clean blanket or bath towel (a hooded one is nice) Clean diaper Clean clothes Vaseline and gauze (if you have a circumcised boy) Warm water (not hot) The basics of bathing a baby: First, undress your baby and cradle their head with one hand. Leave their diaper on, as you'll wash that area last. Wrap your baby in a towel, exposing only the areas that you're washing. Using a baby bath sponge or washcloth, cleanse one area at a time. Start behind the ears, then move to your baby's neck, elbows, knees, and then between their fingers and toes. Pay attention to the creases under their arms, behind the ears, and around their neck. The hair comes toward the end of bath time so your baby doesn't get cold. While newborns don't have much hair, you can sponge the few wisps that are there. To avoid getting their eyes wet, tip their head back just a little. There's no need for shampoo; just use water. Now it's time to remove the diaper and sponge your baby's belly, bottom, and genitals. Wash little girls from front to back. If there's a little vaginal discharge , don't worry—and don't try to wipe it all away. If a little boy is uncircumcised, leave the foreskin alone. If circumcised, don't wash the head of the penis until it's healed. Gently pat your baby dry; rubbing the skin can cause irritation. Bath time is over, and your fresh little baby is ready for a clean diaper and clothes! Avoid adult products when washing your baby. Baby tub baths Once your baby's umbilical cord stump has fallen off, you can start giving them baths. Your baby doesn't need a bath every day — two to three times a week should be fine. Whether you bathe your baby in a baby bath, sink, or bathtub is up to you. However, given that babies are slippery when wet, some parents find it more comfortable to give them a bath in a smaller space, such as a baby bath or a sink. The most important thing to remember about baths is to never leave your baby unattended. Babies can slide down and quickly become submerged in even a few inches of water. Using a baby bath seat is no assurance that your baby will be safe in the bathtub. Many seats can easily tip over. If you need to leave the room, wrap your baby in a towel and take them with you. Not all babies like the transition to tub baths, so if your baby gets fussy, go back to sponge baths for a week or so, then try again. Bathing a baby is a process—an adjustment for both the baby and the parent. To prepare: Find a baby bathtub made of thick plastic that is the right size for your baby. An insert for young babies is ideal. It will help keep your baby's head out of the water. A slip-resistant backing on the tub will keep it from moving during bath time. Avoid inflatable tubs, or baby bathtubs with rough edges or foam cushions, as your baby could accidentally swallow a piece that breaks off. Don't try to use bath seats or bath rings. These are for older babies who can sit up on their own, not for newborns . Put the washcloth, soap, and shampoo—everything you'll need for the bath—close by. That way, you don't have to leave the room once your baby is in the tub. Also, lay out a diaper and clothes where you can easily reach them after the bath. Here are some tips for giving your baby a tub bath: Fill the tub with 2 to 3 inches of water. The bath should be warm but not hot. To ensure the water is at the right temperature, test it first with your elbow. Wash your baby's face gently with a wet washcloth. Use a wet cotton ball or washcloth (no soap) to clean your baby's eyes and face. Wipe from the inside of each eye to the outside. Make sure you get any dried secretions out of the nose and eyes. Soap the washcloth (use a gentle, no-tears baby soap or wash) and clean your baby's body from top to bottom and front to back. Make sure you clean inside all of the little folds. Wash the diaper area last. Fill a cup with water to wet your baby's hair. Put a small amount of baby shampoo on their head. Rub in a gentle circular motion. Keep your baby's head tilted back so the shampoo doesn't run into their eyes . Fill the cup again with clean water to rinse your baby's hair and body. When lifting your baby out of the bath, support their bottom with one hand and their head and neck with the other. Make sure you have a firm hold so your baby doesn't slide away. You don't need to use lotion, but you can apply a small amount after the bath if your baby’s skin is especially dry. If your baby's skin continues to be very dry, you may be giving them baths too often. After the bath, wrap your baby in a towel and gently pat them dry. Baby bath temperatures When you fill the tub to bathe your baby, make sure your water heater is set to around 100 F (38 C). Be sure that the water temperature stays below 120 F (49 C) so that you don't accidentally scald your baby. Your baby can easily chill when they come out of the tub, so keep the room temperature warm. Baby bath toys Because they're in and out of water, bath toys can easily get moldy. Mold grows in dark, wet, and warm places. So while you could spot mold on the outside of your baby's bath toys, often it grows best inside hollow ones where water can get inside. You can wipe away a little mold on the outside of a toy, but if your baby's bath toys smell bad or have more than a little mold, it's best to just throw the toy away. Most of the molds do not pose a significant health risk to your baby, but it's best to avoid it entirely. If you have a new baby and you've had old bath toys in storage for a while, it might be a good idea to replace them in case they've gotten moldy since you last used them. Keeping toys as dry as possible will help keep them mold-free. After bath time, dry any tub toys and be sure to clean them regularly with warm soapy water. Buy solid or hole-free toys to prevent water from getting inside them, where there's a greater chance for mold to grow. Infants younger than 6 months typically don't need bath toys. Once they're a little older and can more easily hold their head up, floating toys, waterproof books, and containers can help keep your baby happily distracted during bath time. Cradle Cap It's common for babies to develop flaky, red patches of skin on their scalp, a condition called cradle cap. It's not a big concern and is easy to treat. Here's how: Before a bath, massage a little bit of petroleum jelly or baby oil into your baby's scalp to loosen the dry skin . Gently rub the oil into your baby's scalp with a soft brush or washcloth to release the flakes. Wash your baby's hair with a gentle baby shampoo. Cradle cap should get better on its own. If it sticks around or spreads to your baby's face, neck, or other parts of the body, see your doctor. You may need a stronger prescription shampoo for your baby's hair and a cortisone cream for your baby's body. How to Cut Your Baby’s Nails Because your baby's fingernails grow very quickly and babies can easily scratch themselves, file or cut their nails about twice a week. As your baby's toenails don't grow as quickly, you can probably get away with cutting them a couple of times a month. Just watch out for any jagged edges that you may need to trim. Whether you opt for baby scissors, baby nail clippers, or a nail file is up to you. Considering the tiny size of baby's nails, decide which one you're most comfortable using. Never bite off your baby's nails — you could give them an infection . Baby nail clippers Here are some tips to make cutting your baby's nails easier: Use nail clippers sized for babies, not for adults. Cut nails after a bath, when they're softer. Sometimes it helps to trim a baby's nails when the baby is asleep and relaxed. If you use scissors or a nail clipper, press the skin under the nail down so you can get to the nail more easily. It may help to have your partner hold the baby's hand steady the first few times so you can concentrate on cutting. Trim their fingernails following the natural curve of the nail. Cut toenails straight across. If you accidentally nip your baby's skin with the scissors, apply gentle pressure with a tissue or piece of gauze. Use a tiny bit of antibacterial ointment on the cut. Don't put on a bandage because your baby could choke on it. Baby nail file Filing your baby's nails generally runs less of a risk that you'll cut their skin. Use an emery board to shorten your baby's nails or to smooth any jagged edges after clipping them."
2,Baby Safety,"Your child's safety is your responsibility. The following tips should help you keep your baby out of harm's way from birth through their toddler years. Baby Safety in the Car Always use a federally approved car safety seat when traveling in a motor vehicle. Carefully read safety seat instructions, as well as instructions in your car's owner's manual, to ensure that the seat has been properly installed. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends buying a new car seat unless you’re sure a used seat has never been in an accident. NEVER carry your infant in your lap while you ride in a car. For the first 2 years of a baby's life, car seats should face the rear of the vehicle. The safest location for the car seat is the middle of the back seat. NEVER put the baby in the front passenger seat of cars, especially those with airbags. If you have a truck with no back seat, you should disengage the airbag while the baby's seat is in the car. Check the height and weight limits on your child’s car seat from time to time to be sure they haven’t outgrown it. You’ll also need to adjust the position of the harness straps as your baby gets bigger. If you have questions about safety seats, call the Auto Safety Hotline at 888-327-4236 (888-DASH-2-DOT). Or visit an NHTSA car seat inspection station . Often, they're located at fire stations. A certified technician will show you how to properly install and use your car seat. To minimize the risk that a child will accidentally be left behind in a car or get trapped inside: Leave a purse, briefcase, shoe, or cell phone in the back seat. That way, you get in the habit of checking in the back seat before leaving the vehicle. Make an arrangement with your child’s day care to have them call you if the child doesn’t show up as expected. Always lock your car and car trunk, even if the car is parked in the driveway at home, and always keep keys out of the reach of little ones. Preventing Baby Falls If you use an infant carrier, always place it on the floor, never on a counter or tabletop. Make sure the baby is always strapped in. Never leave your baby alone on a bed, couch, changing table, or infant seat from which they can fall or roll off. Even if looking away for a second, an accident can happen. Baby Safety, Smoking and Fire Safety Do not smoke and do not allow smoking around your baby. Even smoking “outside” is harmful for the baby because clothing, hair and skin still carry smoke particles. Install a working smoke alarm on every level of your home. Change the batteries of your smoke detectors every 6 months. Have at least one fire extinguisher on every level of your home. If your home uses gas heat, install a carbon monoxide detector. Preventing Baby Burns Do not hold hot liquids while holding your baby. To prevent burns, do not microwave your baby's bottle. Many microwaves heat unevenly, creating ""hot spots"" in your baby's formula that can burn your baby's mouth. Instead, warm the formula by running warm tap water over the bottle or submerging the bottle in a bowl of warm water. Shake the bottle well. Make sure you test the temperature on your hand or wrist before feeding it to your baby. Keep your hot water heater's thermostat at no higher than 120 degrees F. Consider installing anti-scald devices on faucets and shower heads. Preventing Baby Accidents Keep sharp objects (knives, scissors, tools, razors) and other hazardous items (coins, glass objects, beads, pins, medications ) in a secure place out of your baby's reach. NEVER shake a baby or throw your baby in the air. This can cause brain damage or blindness. Do not leave your baby alone with a young sibling or a pet, even when your baby is sleeping. Never put your child in a walker. They send thousands of kids to the emergency room every year, mainly by causing falls down stairs. Make sure that your baby cannot pull lamps or other electrical objects on top of themselves. Use electrical tape to secure electrical cords along baseboards. Remove tablecloths that can be pulled from the table. Make sure all drawers have stops so that your baby or toddler can't pull the drawer out on top of themselves. Attach furniture to the wall so the pieces don’t fall over the child. Avoid electronics on top of higher dressers or tables that can fall on the child. Baby Bathing Safety Always test the bath water to make sure it is not too hot before setting your baby in the water. Dipping your elbow in the water is a good way to test. Turn down your water heater to 120 F. Never leave your baby unattended in the bathtub or bath ring. It only takes a few seconds for a baby to drown. Store small appliances, such as hair dryers and radios, away from the water and bathing areas. Keep these appliances unplugged and out of reach when not in use. Baby Toy Safety Inspect your child's toys often. Be sure that toys are unbreakable, do not come apart, do not have small parts that could be chewed or broken off, and are not sharp. The pieces/toys should be larger than your baby's mouth . Use toy chests without lids or with supports that hold a lid open in any position. Be cautious with balloons to prevent choking. Baby Choking or Strangulation Prevention NEVER put strings or cords around your baby's neck (such as to hold a pacifier ) or near your baby's crib. Be cautious of strings or buttons on clothing; make sure they are not in danger of choking your baby. Secure cords on blinds and drapes out of reach to prevent accidental strangulation. Put away small objects -- even display items -- that can cause injury or choking if swallowed. Baby Feeding Safety Never prop up your baby's bottle and leave your baby unattended; your baby could choke. Do not put your baby to bed with a bottle. Avoid giving your child raw carrots, unpeeled apples, nuts, hard candies, and other foods that present a choking hazard. In a highchair, always use restraining straps that run around your child's waist and between their legs to keep them from sliding out. Baby Sleeping Safety All infants should be put down for sleep on their backs to reduce the risk for sudden infant death syndrome, also called SIDS. Give your baby a pacifier before they go to sleep . This reduces the chance of SIDS. Avoid soft bedding that might suffocate your baby, such as pillows, blankets, plush toys, and bumpers in the crib. Crib slats should be 2 3/8 inches apart or less so the baby’s head can't get trapped. Keep your baby's room at a moderate temperature and dress them in a way that they can't overheat. This also reduces the risk of SIDS. Share a bedroom with your newborn -- but not a bed. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that parents sleep in the same room, preferably for at least the first six months. Avoid devices marketed to reduce the risk of SIDS, such as sleep positioners. Nursing your baby and making sure that your baby gets all of the recommended vaccines can help protect against SIDS. Don’t nurse in a chair or on a couch if you feel you might fall asleep. If your baby falls asleep in a car seat, swing or carrier, try to remove them and lay them on a flat surface. Try to have skin-to-skin contact with your baby. Changing Table Safety Use a sturdy table. Always keep your hands and eyes on your baby while they are on the changing table. Keep supplies within easy reach. Babies and Pets Keep food and water bowls in an area your baby can’t reach. Same with the litterbox. Supervise your child’s interactions with your pets and teach them to be gentle. Hitting or tail-pulling can lead to bites and scratches. Don’t let your animals lick your baby’s face or skin, especially if they have a cut or scrape. Wash your child’s hands after they play with the dog or cat. Keep the pet toys out of your baby’s mouth. Most doctors say pets shouldn’t sleep in your child’s bed. Baby Crawling and Walking Safety When your baby becomes mobile, here are important tips to keep your baby safe around your home: Put electrical outlet covers on all outlets. Secure electrical cords to baseboards. Install safety gates securely in front of stairs and basement doors. Avoid gates with diamond-shaped slats, which provide footholds for climbing toddlers. Instead, use gates with straight, vertical slats, and a swinging door. Use doorknob covers to keep children away from rooms and other areas with hazards. Be careful, though, that these devices are easy for adults to use in case of emergency. Store cleaners and medications out of reach and in a locked cabinet, and always in their original containers. Never store toxic substances in bottles or jars that could be mistaken for food products. Install safety locks on cabinets. Turn pot and pan handles on the stove in and cook on the back burners whenever possible. Establish the area in front of the stove as off-limits while you are cooking. Keep the toilet lid down to prevent drowning and to keep the lid from slamming on your baby's head or hands. Consider installing toilet lid locks. Cushion hard edges and sharp corners of furniture. If possible, move sharp-edged pieces of furniture away from high traffic areas. Anchor down unsteady pieces of furniture, such as bookcases. Place furniture away from high windows so children won't climb onto windowsills. Screens aren't strong enough to keep children from falling through windows. Outdoor Safety If there is a swimming pool in your backyard or your neighborhood, make sure it is surrounded by a fence and has a gate that latches or locks. Better yet, never leave your child unattended when outdoors. Cover areas under and around backyard play sets with shock-absorbing material, such as sand, rubber, or mulch, 9-12 inches deep. During hot summer days, check the temperature of slides and swings. They can become hot enough to cause burns to the skin . Always supervise children on playground equipment. Watch for hazards like stair rungs where they can get stuck, missing guardrails, protruding bolts, or dangling ropes or cords. Teach your child to stay away from stray dogs and wild animals like squirrels and raccoons when you go to the park, and make sure they don’t get hold of animal droppings, which can carry germs. Keep your child away from moving machinery, including lawnmowers and overhead garage doors. Also, keep kids away from driveways and streets. Keep your baby in the shade, if possible. Their skin is thinner and more sensitive. Cover them up with clothes and a hat, limit their time in the sun (especially between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., when the sun is strongest), don’t let them get overheated, and get them out of the sun right away if they show any signs of sunburn or dehydration , including fussiness, redness, and excessive crying. Don’t put bug spray on babies younger than 2 months. Keep them inside when bugs are biting at dawn and dusk. Cover their skin with long sleeves and pants, and cover strollers with mesh netting. Get rid of standing water in your yard where mosquitoes breed, like planters and bird baths. After 2 months bug repellent is OK, but keep it off your baby’s hands and away from their mouth and eyes. Other Baby Safety Precautions Consider taking a certified CPR class if you are not already certified. You can find out about these classes from your local Red Cross or American Heart Association chapter. You may want to post a demonstration chart near your phone. Your baby's caregivers should be CPR-certified. Gather a list of emergency numbers and keep them by the phone. These numbers should include: your child's pediatrician, your health care provider, your family doctor, a 24-hour nurse-on-call number, the police department, the fire department, 911 reminder, and poison control. If a poison is swallowed, call the poison control center (throughout the USA, call 800-222-1222 -- American Association of Poison Control Centers.) Keep poisonous house plants out of reach. For information about which plants are poisonous, contact your local county extension office. Beware of any device that claims to help prevent SIDS. Home monitors, wedges and positioners remain unproven. Name a guardian for your child. In the unfortunate event that something happens to you or your spouse, it's a good idea to have a will that names a legal guardian and alternate guardian for your child. Without a will, the court may appoint a guardian you would not have chosen. Be sure to check with the individuals named in your will to make sure they are willing to serve as your child's guardian. In your will, you can also leave assets to your child in the form of a testamentary, or ""after death"" trust."
3,Septic Arthritis,"Septic arthritis is also known as infectious arthritis , and is usually caused by bacteria. It can also be caused by a virus or fungus. The condition is an inflammation of a joint that's caused by infection. Typically, septic arthritis affects one large joint in the body, such as the knee or hip. Less frequently, septic arthritis can affect multiple joints. What Causes Septic Arthritis? Septic arthritis usually is caused by bacteria that spread through the blood stream from another area of the body. It can also be caused by a bacterial infection from an open wound or an opening from a surgical procedure, such as knee surgery. In adults and children, common bacteria that cause acute septic arthritis include staphylococcus and streptococcus. Among young, sexually active adults, neisseria gonorrhoeae is the most common pathogen for the condition. These foreign invaders enter the bloodstream and infect the joint, causing inflammation and pain. Other infections, such as those caused by viruses and fungi, can also cause arthritis. Viruses include: Hepatitis A, B, and C Parvovirus B19 HIV (AIDS virus) HTLV-1 Adenovirus Coxsackie viruses Mumps Alphaviruses Flaviviruses Fungi that can cause arthritis include histoplasma, coccidioides, and blastomyces. These infections are usually slower to develop than bacterial infections . Who's at Risk for Septic Arthritis? Young children and elderly adults are most likely to develop septic arthritis. People with open wounds are also at a higher risk for septic arthritis. In addition, people with a weakened immune system and those with pre-existing conditions such as cancer , diabetes, intravenous drug abuse, and immune deficiency disorders have a higher risk of septic arthritis. In addition, previously damaged joints have an increased likelihood of becoming infected. What Are the Symptoms of Septic Arthritis? Symptoms of septic arthritis usually come on rapidly with intense pain, joint swelling , and fever. Septic arthritis symptoms may include: Chills Fatigue and generalized weakness Fever Inability to move the limb with the infected joint Severe pain in the affected joint, especially with movement Swelling (increased fluid within the joint) Warmth (the joint is red and warm to touch because of increased blood flow) How Is Septic Arthritis Diagnosed? A procedure called arthrocentesis is commonly used to make an accurate diagnosis of septic arthritis. This procedure involves a surgical puncture of the joint to draw a sample of the joint fluid, known as synovial fluid. Normally, this fluid is sterile and acts as a lubricant. During arthrocentesis, a needle is inserted into the affected joint to collect fluid from the joint. The fluid sample is sent to a lab for evaluation. The lab will perform a white cell count on the fluid, which will usually be very high. The lab will also try to culture bacteria or other organisms. This will help the doctor determine if an infection is present and which organism is causing it. X-rays are typically done to look for joint damage . Blood tests can also be used to monitor inflammation. MRI scanning is sensitive in evaluating joint destruction but is less useful in the early stages. Blood tests can also be taken to detect and monitor inflammation. What's the Treatment for Septic Arthritis? Septic arthritis treatments include using a combination of powerful antibiotics as well as draining the infected synovial fluid from the joint. It's likely that antibiotics will be administered immediately to avoid the spread of the infection. Intravenous (IV) antibiotics are given, usually requiring admission to the hospital for initial treatment. The treatment, however, may be continued on an outpatient basis at home with the assistance of a home health nursing service. Initially, empiric antibiotics are chosen to cover a wide range of infections. If the bacteria can be identified, antibiotics specific to that organism are used. It may take four to six weeks of treatment with antibiotics to ensure complete eradication of the infectious agents. Is the Infected Fluid Drained? Drainage of the infected area is critical for rapid clearing of the infection. Drainage is performed by removing the fluid with a needle and syringe. Often the draining occurs daily or with multiple surgical procedures. The exact method depends on the location of the joint. Using arthroscopy , your doctor can irrigate the joint and remove the infected tissue. If drainage cannot be accomplished with joint aspirations or arthroscopy, open joint surgery is often necessary to drain the joint. If the fluid buildup is significant, the drains are left in place to remove excess fluid that may build up after the surgery."
4,Meningitis,"What Is Meningitis? Meningitis is a rare infection that affects the delicate membranes -- called meninges -- that cover the brain and spinal cord. You or your children can catch it. Meningitis vs. encephalitis These two conditions are similar, and many symptoms overlap. While meningitis affects the covering of the brain and spinal cord, encephalitis affects the tissue of the brain itself. Types of Meningitis Bacterial meningitis This is an extremely serious illness. You or your child will need to get medical help right away. It can be life-threatening or lead to brain damage unless you get quick treatment. Several kinds of bacteria can cause bacterial meningitis. The most common ones in the U.S. are: Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) Neisseria meningitidis (meningococcus) Listeria monocytogenes (in older people, pregnant women, or those with immune system problems) A bacteria called Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) was a common cause of meningitis in babies and young children until the Hib vaccine became available for infants. There are also vaccines for Neisseria meningitidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Experts recommend that all children get them, as well as all adults who are at a higher risk for the disease. In many cases, bacterial meningitis starts when bacteria get into your bloodstream from your sinuses , ears , or throat. The bacteria travel through your bloodstream to your brain. The bacteria that cause meningitis can spread when people who are infected cough or sneeze . If you or your child has been around someone who has bacterial meningitis, ask your doctor what steps you should take to avoid catching it. Viral meningitis Viral meningitis is more common than the bacterial form and generally less serious, but this isn't always the case. Several viruses can trigger the disease. Among them are: Non-polio enteroviruses, including the one that causes hand, foot, and mouth disease Herpes simplex virus Varicella zoster, which also causes chickenpox and shingles Mumps virus Measles virus Arboviruses such as West Nile and Zika Epstein-Barr, which also causes mononucleosis HIV Flu viruses Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus Fungal meningitis Fungal meningitis is much less common than the bacterial or viral forms. Healthy people rarely get it. You’re more likely to get this form of meningitis if you have a problem with your immune system, such as AIDS . Among the fungi that cause it are: Cryptococcus , which is common everywhere in the world. Histoplasma, which is especially common in soil with lots of bird or bat poop. In the U.S., it's found mostly in eastern and central states. Blastomyces, which thrives in wet soil and decaying leaves. In the U.S., it's found mostly in midwestern, south-central, and southeastern states. Coccidioides, which is found in the soil in the southwestern U.S., Mexico, Central and South America, and some parts of Washington state. Parasitic meningitis Parasitic meningitis is also rare. It’s caused by parasites that usually affect animals. You can get it from eating animals such as snails, slugs, snakes, fish , or poultry that are infected by parasites or their eggs, or produce that contains parasite eggs. The risk is higher with raw or undercooked foods. You can’t pass on this type of meningitis to other people. One especially rare type of this is called eosinophilic meningitis, and it's linked to three specific parasites: Angiostrongylus cantonensis , also known as rat lungworm, is found in Southeast Asia, Pacific islands, the Caribbean, and Africa. Baylisascaris procyonis is a type of roundworm that affects raccoons. It can also infect other small animals, including dogs. Gnathostoma spinigerum is a parasitic worm found mostly in Asia, South and Central America, and some parts of Africa. Amoebic meningitis Amoebic meningitis is a rare but usually fatal infection by a single-celled bug called Naegleria fowleri . This amoeba lives in soil or warm, fresh water, but not salt water. People typically get it from swimming in water where the amoeba lives, not by drinking it. Amoebic meningitis isn’t contagious. Noninfectious meningitis Noninfectious meningitis is caused by diseases such as lupus or cancer , or it may happen if you’ve had a head injury , brain surgery, or take certain medications . It isn’t contagious. Chronic meningitis Chronic meningitis has similar symptoms as acute meningitis but develops over a couple of weeks. It results from infections with a fungus or the mycobacteria that cause tuberculosis . These organisms get into the tissue and fluid surrounding your brain to cause meningitis. Aseptic meningitis is a term doctors use when they can't find signs of bacteria in fluid from your brain and spine. That might mean your meningitis has another cause, such as a virus, or it might mean the bacteria making you sick is hard to grow in lab conditions. Meningitis Symptoms Meningitis can cause a rash that starts small and looks like pinpricks before spreading into red or purple splotches. It can be hard to spot if your skin tone is darker – check the palms of your hands and the soles of your feet. (Photo Credit: John Radcliffe Hospital/Science Source) Meningitis symptoms can develop within hours or days. The condition may look different in adults than it does in babies or children. Signs to watch for include: Confusion Fever Headache Numbness in your face Sensitivity to light Stiff neck so that you can’t lower your chin to your chest Upset stomach or vomiting Severe headache with nausea or vomiting A hard time concentrating Seizures Sleepiness or a hard time waking up Lack of appetite Lack of thirst What's the first sign of meningitis? In the early stages of meningitis, you might feel like you have the flu. Meningitis in babies In infants, meningitis symptoms may include: High fever Crying that’s constant and gets louder when you hold the baby Baby seems overly sleepy, sluggish, or inactive Stiff neck or body Bulge on the soft area on the top of the baby ’s head Poor ability to feed Crankiness Meningitis in children The symptoms of meningitis in children older than 2 are the same as they are in adults. Meningitis rash Meningococcal bacteria is the main cause of the signature meningitis rash. As the bacteria spread through your body, they damage blood vessels. The vessels start to leak blood, which pools into surrounding tissue and becomes visible on your skin. It may start as what's called a ""petechial"" rash, which looks like small, red pinpricks on your skin. You may find them in spots where clothes put pressure on the skin – the waistband, for instance. A ""purpuric"" rash looks like splotches of red or purple, more like bruising. A petechial rash can progress to this stage. It can be tough to spot the rash on darker skin. Check paler areas of the body, such as the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, tummy, roof of the mouth, and insides of eyelids. If you roll a clear drinking glass over the rash, it might disappear. If it does, it's a ""blanching"" rash. If it doesn't go away, it's a ""non-blanching"" rash. A meningitis rash may start as blanching but almost always will progress to non-blanching. You can have meningitis without developing the rash. But the rash is a sign of serious illness, and anyone with it needs immediate medical help. Risk Factors for Meningitis Anyone can get meningitis, but research shows that it's more common in these age groups: Children under 5 Teenagers and young adults aged 16-25 Adults older than 55 Meningitis is more of a danger for people with certain medical conditions, such as a damaged or missing spleen , long-term disease, or immune system disorders . Because certain germs that cause meningitis can spread easily, outbreaks are most likely to happen in places where people live close to each other. College students in dorms or military recruits in barracks can be more likely to catch the disease. So are people who travel to areas where meningitis is more common, such as parts of Africa. Meningitis and Pregnancy One type of germ that causes bacterial meningitis is listeria. If you're pregnant, you're 13 times more susceptible than the general population to infection by this bacteria. It can contaminate: Hot dogs Lunch meat Paté and other meat spreads Smoked seafood Unwashed raw fruits and vegetables Unpasteurized milk Unpasteurized soft cheeses, including f eta, queso blanco, queso fresco, Brie, queso panela, Camembert, and blue-veined cheeses A listeria infection can lead to meningitis. During pregnancy, it can cause early labor or may be fatal to your baby. That's why doctors recommend avoiding foods most often affected by listeria when you're pregnant. Meningitis Causes Meningitis almost always results from a bacterial or viral infection that begins somewhere else in your body, such as your ears , sinuses , or throat. Less common causes of meningitis include: Autoimmune disorders Cancer medications Syphilis Tuberculosis Is meningitis contagious? Meningitis isn't contagious. But some of the things that cause it are. Many things that cause bacterial and viral meningitis can be spread to other people. Meningitis Diagnosis Your doctor will ask about your medical history and do a physical exam , including checking your neck for stiffness and looking for a skin rash that might suggest a bacterial infection. Meningitis tests If your doctor suspects meningitis, you'll need tests to confirm the diagnosis. They might include: Blood tests to find bacteria CT or MRI scans of your head to find swelling or inflammation Spinal tap, in which a health care worker uses a needle to take fluid from around your spinal cord. It can tell what’s causing your meningitis. Treatment for Meningitis Your treatment will depend on the type of meningitis you have. Bacterial meningitis needs treatment with antibiotics right away. The doctor might give you a general or broad-spectrum antibiotic even before they’ve found the exact bacteria that caused your illness. Once they do, they’ll change to a drug that targets the specific bacteria they find with the spinal tap. You might also get corticosteroids to ease inflammation . Viral meningitis usually goes away on its own without treatment. Your doctor might tell you to stay in bed, drink plenty of fluids, and take over-the-counter pain medicines if you have a fever or aches. If a virus such as herpes or influenza caused your illness, you might take antiviral medication. Antifungal medications can treat fungal meningitis. You might need to spend time in the hospital if you're dehydrated or have severe symptoms. Complications of Meningitis Meningitis can cause severe complications in adults and children, especially if you delay treatment. Possible complications include: Seizures Brain damage or stroke Loss of hearing Memory problems Learning problems A hard time walking, or paralysis Kidney failure Shock Death Prevention of Meningitis You may be able to prevent meningitis by avoiding infection with the viruses or bacteria that cause it. These infections are passed to others when you cough, sneeze , kiss, or share toothbrushes , or eating utensils. Take these steps to prevent infections: Wash your hands often. Rinse well. Also, teach your kids to wash their hands often, especially after eating, using the toilet, or when they’re in public places. Don’t share items such as toothbrushes, eating utensils, or lipstick. Don’t share food items or drinks with other people. Cover your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze. Stay healthy. Eat a healthy diet , get plenty of exercise, and rest at night. If you’re pregnant, eat well-cooked food. Avoid foods made from unpasteurized milk and raw or undercooked meats, fish, and eggs. Get immunized. Follow your doctor’s advice on getting immunization shots for diseases that may cause meningitis, including flu and pneumonia vaccines. Meningitis Vaccines Some vaccines can help protect you from meningococcal illness, which is caused by bacteria. MenACWY vaccine, which the CDC recommends for all teens and preteens. One dose is given at the age of 11 or 12, followed by a booster at age 16. It's also recommended for adults at high risk. MenB vaccine is recommended for children 10 and older who are at increased risk MenABCWY vaccine is a combination of MenACWY and MenB. If you're planning to get the other two at the same time, you can get this vaccine instead. The pneumococcal and Hib vaccines protect against bacteria that can cause bacterial meningitis. The Bacille Calmette-Guerin vaccine protects you against tuberculosis, which can cause meningitis. But it isn't used much in the U.S. Takeaways When you have meningitis, the protective layers around your brain and spinal cord (meninges) become inflamed. Most cases are caused by viruses, but other causes include bacteria, fungi, parasites, or amoeba. Common symptoms include a stiff neck, headache, fever, nausea, and vomiting. If you think you might have meningitis, get immediate medical help. If you have bacterial meningitis, your symptoms could get worse rapidly. Meningitis FAQs Can you have meningitis without a fever? Fever is a common symptom, but not everyone with meningitis has a fever. Can a person survive meningitis? Most people survive most forms of meningitis. How well you do depends on the type you have and how quickly you receive treatment. Amoebic meningitis cases caused by Naegleria fowleri are often fatal, but these infections are also very rare. How long does meningitis last? If you have viral meningitis, your main symptoms may go away within a week. If you have bacterial or fungal meningitis, you may need more time to recover, weeks or even months. You also might have lingering effects."
5,An Overview of Meningococcal Meningitis,"Meningococcal meningitis is a rare but serious bacterial infection. It causes the membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord to become inflamed. Each year, approximately 1,000 people in the U.S. get meningococcal disease , which includes meningitis and septicemia ( blood infection ). Meningococcal meningitis can be fatal or cause great harm without prompt treatment; as many as one out of five people who contract the infection have serious complications. According to the Centers for Disease Control, even with antibiotics, 10 to 15% of those infected will die and about 1 in 5 of those who survive are left with long-term disabilities that include deafness , brain damage , neurological problems, and even loss of a limb. Here's what you need to know about the symptoms of meningococcal meningitis and ways to prevent and treat it. What Causes Meningococcal Meningitis? Bacteria and viruses are the two main causes of meningitis. The bacterium Neisseria meningitidis , also called meningococcus, causes meningococcal meningitis. In children and teens , meningococcus is the most common cause of bacterial meningitis . In adults, it is the second most common cause. Meningococcal bacteria may cause infection in a part of the body -- the skin , gastrointestinal tract, or respiratory tract, for instance. For unknown reasons, the bacteria may then spread through the bloodstream to the nervous system . When it gets there, it causes meningococcal meningitis. Bacteria can also enter the nervous system directly after severe head trauma , surgery, or infection. Your risk for meningococcal meningitis increases if you are exposed to the bacterium that causes it. Your risk also increases if you've had a recent upper respiratory infection. Babies, children, teens, and the elderly are at greatest risk. What Are the Symptoms of Meningococcal Meningitis? Symptoms of meningococcal meningitis may vary from case to case. The more common signs and symptoms include: General poor feeling Sudden high fever Severe, persistent headache Neck stiffness Nausea or vomiting Discomfort in bright lights Drowsiness or difficulty awakening Joint pain Confusion or other mental changes A reddish or purple skin rash ( known as petechiae) is a very important sign to watch for. If it does not turn white when you press a glass against it, the rash may be a sign of bacteremia, or a bacterial infection in the bloodstream. This is a medical emergency. Meningococcemia is a serious type of blood poisoning caused by the Neisseria meningitidis bacteria. A significant rash can develop as the infection damages blood vessels throughout the body. This infection is in an 11-year-old boy and is characterized by the star-like rash that is cherry red with a bluish tint. Other symptoms of meningitis or bacteremia may include: Tense or bulging soft spot (in babies) High-pitched or moaning cry (in babies) Stiff, jerky movements or floppiness (in babies or toddlers ) Irritability Fast breathing Lethargy or excessive sleepiness Blotchy skin, turning pale or blue Shivering, or cold hands and feet Seizure What's the Treatment for Meningococcal Meningitis? Meningococcal meningitis can cause death or serious complications, such as brain damage , paralysis, gangrene , or deafness . To prevent these problems, it's important to act quickly. Do not wait. Seek immediate medical attention. Go to an emergency room or call 911 if: You notice symptoms of meningococcal meningitis. Symptoms do not improve with treatment. You think you have been exposed to meningococcal meningitis. Tests can confirm a diagnosis of meningococcal meningitis. The doctor may start antibiotics , such as penicillin or ceftriaxone , by an IV, or intravenous line. You or your child may also need other medication to treat problems related to increased spinal fluid pressure. Doctors sometimes prescribe steroids . If you or someone you love has come into close contact (via saliva or other oral secretions) with someone who has meningococcal meningitis -- such as at school, day care , work, or home -- it is very important to get antibiotics to prevent infection. Are There Vaccines for Meningococcal Meningitis? Meningococcal meningitis is a serious disease -- even with treatment. That's why prevention is a far better approach. The meningococcal vaccine can prevent meningitis infection. In the U.S., three types of meningococcal vaccines are used: Meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MCV4) -- One of these vaccines , Menactra , is approved for people ages 9 months to 55. The other, Menveo , is used in those ages 2 through 55. Meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine (MPSV4) -- This vaccine was approved in the 1970s and protects against most forms of meningococcal disease. This vaccine used is for people as young as 9 months and older than age 55. Serogroup B Meningococcal B (MenB) - There are two MenB vaccines. Trumenba (MenB-FHbp) and Bexsero (MenB-4C). Both are licensed for ages 10-24 but can be used in older patients. Although they cannot prevent all types of meningococcal disease, both vaccines can prevent many types of the disease. Both are effective in nine out of 10 people. MCV4 tends to give longer protection and is better at preventing transmission of the disease. Doctors recommend a dose of MCV4, which is given as a shot, for children at age 11, and then a booster shot at age 16. If the first dose is missed, the MCV4 can be administered between ages 13 and 15, followed by a booster dose between ages 16 and 18. People ages 16-18 who are not high risk should also get a MenB vaccine. The vaccine is also designed for people ages 10-24 who are at high risk. It can be used in older adults. Other people at risk should also consider getting a vaccine. That includes: People who think they've been exposed to meningococcal meningitis College students living in dorms U.S. military recruits Travelers to areas of the world, such as Africa, where meningococcal disease is common People with a damaged spleen or with terminal complement component deficiency, which is an immune system disorder Lab personnel who are often exposed to the meningococcal bacteria A second dose is recommended for everyone. Wait to get vaccinated if you are very ill at the time you're scheduled for the shot. Avoid the vaccine if you: Have had a severe allergic reaction to a previous dose Have a severe allergy to any vaccine component Have ever had Guillain -Barre Syndrome or acute disseminated encephalomyelitis Mild pain or redness at the injection site is common and should not be a problem. But call your doctor right away if you have a strong reaction to the vaccine. This includes a high fever , weakness , or signs of an allergic reaction , such as trouble breathing , a fast heartbeat, or dizziness ."
6,Bacterial Vaginosis,"What Is Bacterial Vaginosis? Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is an infection of the vagina. It results from a change in the normal balance of vaginal bacteria. BV is a very common vaginal infection. About 35% of people with a vagina will get BV at some point. Rates are even higher among Black people with a vagina, with close to 50% getting BV. BV usually doesn't cause any other health problems. But it can lead to issues, especially when you're pregnant or trying to get pregnant. BV vs. yeast infection BV isn’t the same as a yeast infection. BV is caused by bacteria, while a yeast infection results from a fungus called candida, which is also known as yeast. These infections happen when the healthy levels of bacteria or yeast in the vagina get out of balance. Both BV and yeast infections cause increased vaginal discharge and require treatment. You usually can tell the infections apart due to your symptoms, but not always. Typically, BV has a fishy smell. A yeast infection usually has no odor and involves a thick, white discharge, itchiness, burning, and pain when peeing. Your doctor will give you an antibiotic for BV. Yeast infections can be treated using over-the-counter medications. Is bacterial vaginosis an STD? BV is not a sexually transmitted disease (STD) or a sexually transmitted infection (STI). But people who are sexually active, particularly those with more than one sex partner, are more likely to get BV. People who do not have vaginas and people who are not sexually active rarely get BV. You might feel embarrassed to have BV. But know that it is very common, can be treated by your doctor, and is not caused by anything you did wrong. Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is an infection of the vagina that results from a change in the normal balance of vaginal bacteria. BV symptoms can look like those from other infections, so it’s important to find out the cause. (Photo credit: Kateryna Kon/Dreamstime) Bacterial Vaginosis Symptoms About half of the time, people with BV have no symptoms. But they can include: Pain, burning, or itching in the vagina Burning sensation when you pee Fishy smell that gets stronger after sex Thin white, gray, or green discharge Stomach pain Higher vaginal pH Bacterial vaginosis discharge Not everyone with BV has vaginal discharge. If you do, it is usually thin and watery. The color can be white, gray, or greenish. Bacterial vaginosis smell You can have BV and not notice any change in vaginal odor. But often, there is a fishy or foul-smelling odor, especially after sex. When to See a Doctor About Bacterial Vaginosis Because BV symptoms can look like those from other infections, it’s important to find out the cause. See your doctor if you: Have a new vaginal discharge along with a smell, itchiness, pain, or a fever Have more than one intimate partner or a new partner (if so, you might need to be checked for an STD or STI) Used an over-the-counter medicine for a yeast infection but still have symptoms Bacterial Vaginosis Causes It's unclear exactly why BV happens. What is known is that a type of healthy bacteria called lactobacillus keeps your vagina slightly acidic, which prevents the growth of bad bacteria. If your lactobacillus levels drop, more bad bacteria move in, and you get BV. Is bacterial vaginosis contagious? BV is not contagious, except during sex if both partners have vaginas. People who are sexually active are more likely to get BV. It’s not known why or how sex increases the risk of BV. You can not get it from sharing bedding, towels, or clothing with someone who has BV. Is BV a sign of cheating? Having BV does not mean that you or your partner are cheating. But if you have more than one sex partner, you are more likely to get BV. Sexual activity, with the same or a different partner, can change the pH or balance of bacteria in the vagina, making BV more likely. Why do I keep getting bacterial vaginosis? If you keep getting BV, you’re not alone. Researchers aren’t sure why, but recurrent BV is very common. Nearly 50% of people with BV will get it again within one year. Not clearing the original infection may be to blame. You can reduce your risk of having BV in the future by using condoms, not douching, keeping sex toys clean, and reducing your number of sex partners. Bacterial Vaginosis Risk Factors Anyone with a vagina can get BV, but your risks are higher if you: Smoke. Are sexually active. Being sexually active is a risk factor, especially if you don’t use condoms or dental dams. BV isn’t sexually transmitted, but researchers think that sex may change the balance of bacteria in your vagina, which makes an overgrowth of unhealthy bacteria more likely . Use a douche. Douching upsets the natural balance of bacteria. So can scented soaps, bubble baths, and vaginal deodorants. Have a new or multiple sex partners. Having a new sex partner, or more than one, makes it more likely for you to develop BV. It isn’t clear why, but people with vaginas who have female partners are most at risk. You can get BV from oral, vaginal, and anal sex. Are in your reproductive years. Children and people who have never had sex or who are not sexually active rarely get BV. More research is needed to know how common BV is after menopause. Use an intrauterine device (IUD). Using an IUD, which is a form of birth control that fits inside your uterus, has also been linked to BV, especially if you have irregular bleeding. But it isn’t clear whether it’s a direct cause. Have a naturally low level of lactobacilli bacteria in your vagina. Are taking antibiotics. You can’t get vaginal infections like BV from swimming pools or public toilet seats. Bacterial Vaginosis in Pregnancy You're more likely to get BV during pregnancy due to the hormonal changes that happen in your body while expecting. If you have BV during pregnancy, it’s very important to treat it. Some research shows that BV is linked to an increased risk of certain pregnancy-related complications, such as: Delivering your baby early (preterm birth), which can lead to issues for your baby, such as low birth weight and breathing problems Your water breaking early (early rupturing of your amniotic sac) Miscarriage Some new studies point to other causes of these issues. But more research is needed as pregnant people with BV do have higher rates of pregnancy complications. Having BV while pregnant can also put you at risk for chorioamnionitis, which is inflammation of the membranes surrounding the baby in utero. This increases your chance of early delivery. A newborn who survives this kind of delivery has a higher-than-normal risk of cerebral palsy, a disorder that affects your baby’s ability to move and maintain balance and posture. Bacterial Vaginosis Diagnosis To confirm a BV diagnosis, your doctor will: Ask about your medical history Do an overall physical exam Do a pelvic exam Check your vagina’s pH or acidity level Take a sample of discharge from your vagina to look for cells covered with bacteria Tests for BV Your doctor can check your vaginal discharge for BV. These tests include: Wet mount or vaginal smear. This test looks at a sample under a microscope to check for infection. Whiff test. Vaginal fluid is mixed with a chemical that produces a strong, fishy smell if you have BV. Vaginal pH. The acidity of your discharge is checked. A high reading is a sign of BV. PCR test. This test looks for DNA from harmful bacteria and costs more, so it is not used very often. Home test kits There are many BV home test kits on the market. They are not always accurate. Your best bet is to get checked by your doctor. But when used correctly, some tests are close to 90% reliable. Bacterial Vaginosis Treatment There are a variety of medications your doctor may prescribe to treat BV. Even if you don’t have symptoms, it’s important to know how to get rid of BV. Untreated bacterial vaginosis BV will sometimes go away on its own. More often though, the infection will continue or get worse. BV may also come back if it isn’t fully treated. Untreated BV is most harmful during pregnancy but increases the risk of STIs and can cause irritation, discharge, and a strong vaginal odor. Bacterial vaginosis medication To treat BV, your doctor can prescribe antibiotics, which could be in the form of a tablet or granules you take by mouth, or an ovule suppository, cream, or gel you put into your vagina. These medications include: Clindamycin, a cream you use in your vagina. It sells under the brand names Cleocin and Clindesse. Don't rely on condoms for birth control with this medication, as it can weaken latex condoms not only while you’re taking it, but for at least 3 days after you stop. Metronidazole, available as a pill you swallow or a gel you insert in your vagina. This medication sells under the brand names Flagyl and Metrogel-Vaginal. Secnidazole, available as a single pill you take once. It’s sold under the brand name Solosec. Tinidazole, available as a pill you swallow. It’s sold under the brand name Tindamax. Metronidazole, secnidazole, and tinidazole won’t affect the birth control pill or patch. However, they can cause nausea or stomach pain, especially if you drink alcohol during or 1-3 days after treatment. It’s recommended to avoid drinking alcohol with these medications. BV can get worse after having sex. So, avoid sexual contact until you're done taking your medicine and your symptoms are gone. You'll need to take most treatments for 5-7 days. Complete your entire course of medication, even if the symptoms go away. If you stop early, the infection could come back. If your partner also has a vagina, they may want to see their doctor to find out if they need treatment. Partners with a penis do not need to be treated. Bacterial Vaginosis Home Remedies You should always talk to a doctor before trying to treat BV at home. Some home treatment methods that may help include: Probiotics. You find these live bacteria in some foods such as yogurt, sauerkraut, or kefir. You can also take probiotics as a supplement. They may help balance out the bacteria in your vagina and treat your BV. There are at least seven types of bacteria that grow in the vagina. Lactobacillus is one of them. BV is linked to a decline in lactobacillus levels, which is found in yogurt and acidophilus milk. Some studies suggest that eating foods that contain lactobacillus may be beneficial, but more research is needed. Do not douche with yogurt or any other product. Vaginal douching is a risk factor for BV. Garlic supplements. A very small study on 120 women showed that taking a garlic supplement for 7 days worked as well as an antibiotic to relieve symptoms of BV. Vitamin C. Some studies have shown that taking a daily 250 mg vitamin C supplement may help improve your vaginal pH (the measure of acidity or basicity) and increase the levels of healthy bacteria. It may also work to help prevent BV from coming back. Boric acid for BV Your doctor may recommend boric acid suppositories you put in your vagina. You can buy these over the counter. Boric acid can help rebalance the acid in your vagina and relieve itching and burning. There is not much research on using boric acid to treat BV or on the safety of its long-term use. But when combined with antibiotic medications, it can help clear infections, particularly for people with recurrent BV. Hydrogen peroxide for BV Rinsing your vagina with hydrogen peroxide may help reduce BV symptoms, treat infection, and prevent reoccurrence. Healthy vaginal bacteria produce hydrogen peroxide, which keeps bad bacteria in check. Research shows washing with hydrogen peroxide for 7 days can regulate vaginal pH and prevent BV from coming back. Check with your doctor to find out if this remedy is right for you. Bacterial Vaginosis Complications Bacterial vaginosis, especially if you don’t treat it, has been tied to a higher risk of other health problems. These include: A bacterial infection, if you have a hysterectomy or other surgery on your organs while you have BV A sexually transmitted infection such as herpes, chlamydia, or gonorrhea, or passing HIV to your partner. There is increased HIV shedding in people with HIV when they have BV, making transmission more likely. You are also more likely to get HIV during sex from your partner if you have BV. Less success with fertility treatments such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) Increased risk of blockage in your fallopian tubes, preventing sperm and egg from meeting (which lowers your chance of getting pregnant) Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), an infection of the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries Recurrent Bacterial Vaginosis Sometimes, BV comes back after treatment and can even become chronic. As many as 50% of people who have BV will have a recurrence. This may happen if: You’re resistant to treatment Treatment didn’t clear the whole infection You are reinfected by new sexual partners Even after BV is treated and goes away, it often returns. If that happens, you'll probably need to take antibiotics again for a longer time. They may prescribe extended-use metronidazole. If you use an IUD, and BV keeps coming back (recurrent BV), you may want to talk to your doctor about a different type of birth control. How to Prevent Bacterial Vaginosis To lower your chances of getting BV, take these steps: Clean sex toys after every use. Get tested for STDs, and make sure your sex partners are tested. Limit your number of sex partners. Use a condom or dental dam during sex. Use only water or mild unscented soap to wash your vagina. To help maintain a healthy pH in your vagina: Don’t douche. Avoid antiseptic bath products such as antibacterial soaps, which can cause an imbalance in the bacteria in your vagina. Wipe from front to back after you use the bathroom. If you wipe the other way, bacteria from your poop could get into your vagina and disrupt your vaginal balance. Wear cotton or cotton-lined underwear. Less breathable fabrics trap moisture and increase heat, making bacteria growth more likely. Avoid scented menstrual products, which can increase vaginal pH. Takeaways If you suspect you have BV, contact your doctor to get tested. Ask about any other remedies you can try in addition to taking antibiotics. Avoid sex until your infection clears and contact your doctor if you notice signs of recurrent BV. Bacterial Vaginosis FAQs Can bacterial vaginosis go away on its own? BV can sometimes go away without treatment; however, it's important to be seen if you have symptoms, as you can have pregnancy complications and increase your risk of STDs Is bacterial vaginosis contagious? BV is not contagious, except it can be passed during sex between people who have vaginas. What do BV sores look like? BV does not cause vaginal sores. If sores are present, you may have another type of infection such as herpes or genital warts. Why does my boyfriend keep giving me BV? Having sex increases your risk of BV because it can disrupt your vaginal balance. Although men and people assigned male at birth (AMAB) can't get BV, they can spread the bacteria, getting BV from one sexual partner who is a woman/person assigned female at birth (AFAB) and carrying it to another partner who is a woman/AFAB.  Studies show that a woman or person AFAB who has an ongoing male (AMAB) partner is twice as likely to get recurring BV; and not using a condom regularly during penis-in-vagina sex is linked to higher rates of recurring BV."
7,Dental Health and Bad Breath,"Bad breath, medically called halitosis, can result from poor dental health habits and may be a sign of other health problems. Bad breath can also be made worse by the types of foods you eat and other unhealthy lifestyle habits. You can take steps to prevent and treat halitosis, at home and with the help of your dentist or doctor. How Does Food Affect Breath? Basically, all the food eaten begins to be broken down in your mouth. Also, foods are absorbed into your bloodstream and move to the lungs, affecting the air you exhale. If you eat foods with strong odors (such as garlic or onions), brushing and flossing – even mouthwash – merely covers up the odor temporarily. The odor will not go away completely until the foods have passed through your body. Other common foods that can cause bad breath include: Cheese Pastrami Certain spices Orange juice or soda Alcohol Likewise, dieters who don't eat often enough can have bad breath. When your body breaks down fat, the process releases chemicals that can give your breath an unpleasant smell. Why Do Poor Habits Cause Bad Breath? If you don't brush and floss teeth daily, food particles can remain in your mouth, promoting bacterial growth between teeth, around the gums, and on the tongue. This causes bad breath. Inflammation of the gums (gingivitis) from poor dental hygiene can also cause bad breath. In addition, odor-causing bacteria and food particles can cause bad breath if dentures are not properly cleaned. Smoking or chewing tobacco -based products also can cause bad breath, stain teeth, reduce your ability to taste foods, and irritate your gums. What Health Problems Are Associated With Bad Breath? Persistent bad breath or a bad taste in the mouth may be a warning sign of gum (periodontal) disease. Gum disease is caused by the buildup of plaque on teeth. Bacteria cause toxins to form, which irritate the gums. If gum disease continues untreated, it can damage the gums and jawbone. Other dental causes of bad breath include poorly fitting dental appliances, yeast infections of the mouth, and cavities. The medical condition dry mouth (also called xerostomia) also can cause bad breath. Saliva is necessary to moisten the mouth, neutralize acids produced by plaque, and wash away dead cells that build up on the tongue, gums, and cheeks. If not removed, these cells decompose and can cause bad breath. Dry mouth may be a side effect of various medications, salivary gland problems , or continuous breathing through the mouth. In fact, morning breath is worse for people who sleep with their mouths open. Many other diseases and illnesses can cause bad breath, including: Seasonal allergies Respiratory tract infections such as pneumonia or bronchitis Long-term (chronic) sinus infections Postnasal drip Diabetes Chronic acid reflux Gastrointestinal issues Chronic lung infection Liver or kidney problems What Can I Do to Prevent Bad Breath? There are some quick and easy ways to banish bad breath. Just remember, the odor from what you eat can stick around until the food works its way completely out of your system – up to 3 days later! Bad breath can be reduced or prevented if you: Brush and floss more often. Practice good oral hygiene. Brush twice a day with fluoride toothpaste to remove food debris and plaque. Brush your teeth after you eat. (Keep a toothbrush at work or school to brush after lunch.) Replace your toothbrush every 2 to 3 months or after an illness. Trapped food also adds to the problem. Use floss or an interdental cleaner to remove food particles and plaque between teeth at least once a day. Rinse your mouth out. A mouthwash adds extra protection by getting rid of bacteria. You can also help your breath if you swish your mouth with plain water after you eat. It can help to at least loosen up and free those trapped bits of food particles that get stuck in your teeth. Scrape your tongue . The coating that normally forms on your tongue can be a host for smelly bacteria. Tongue scrapers are designed specifically to apply even pressure across the surface of the tongue area and clear any buildup. Avoid foods that sour your breath. Onions and garlic are big offenders. But brushing after you eat them doesn't help. Skip after-dinner mints and chew gum instead. The bacteria in your mouth love sugar. They use it to make acid. This wears down your teeth and causes bad breath. Chewing sugarless gum or sucking on sugarless candy also stimulates the production of saliva, which helps wash away food particles and bacteria. Gums and mints containing xylitol are best. Keep your gums healthy . Antiseptic mouthwash can help kill bacteria that cause bad breath and plaque that can lead to gingivitis, an early, mild form of gum disease. Moisten your mouth. You can get tooth decay and bad breath if you don't make enough saliva. If your mouth is dry, drink plenty of water during the day. You can also try a humidifier at night to moisten the air in your house. Keep your dental devices clean. Dentures should be removed at night and cleaned thoroughly before being placed in your mouth the next morning. Clean braces and retainers as directed by your dentist. See your dentist regularly – at least twice a year. They will do an oral exam and professional teeth cleaning and will be able to find and treat periodontal disease, dry mouth, or other problems that may be the cause of bad breath. Stop smoking and chewing tobacco-based products. Ask your dentist for tips on kicking the habit. Eat more fruits and vegetables and less meat. Apples, carrots, celery, and other hard fruits and vegetables help clear odor-causing plaque and food particles from your mouth. Keep a log of the foods you eat. If you think they may be causing bad breath, bring the log to your dentist to review. Similarly, make a list of the medications you take. Some drugs may play a role in creating mouth odors. Who Treats Bad Breath? In most cases, your dentist can treat the cause of bad breath. If your dentist determines that your mouth is healthy and the odor is not of oral origin, you may be referred to your family doctor or to a specialist to determine the odor source and treatment plan. You can go over a list of your medications with them to see if any of them could be adding to the problem. Work with them to keep diabetes, allergies, and other conditions under control. If the odor is due to gum disease, for example, your dentist can either treat the disease or refer you to a periodontist , a dentist who specializes in treating gum conditions. What Products Can I Use to Get Rid of Bad Breath? An antiseptic mouthwash can help eliminate bacteria that cause bad breath. For dry mouth, your dentist might recommend artificial saliva. Ask your dentist about which product is best for you."
8,Understanding Hair Loss: The Basics,"What Is Hair Loss? Hair grows everywhere on the human skin except on places like the palms of our hands and the soles of our feet, our eyelids and belly buttons, but many hairs are so fine they're virtually invisible. Hair is made of a protein called keratin that is produced in hair follicles in the outer layer of skin. As follicles produce new hair cells, old cells are being pushed out through the surface of the skin at the rate of about 6 inches a year. The hair you can see is actually a string of dead keratin cells. The average adult head has about 100,000 to 150,000 hairs and loses up to 100 of them a day; finding a few stray hairs on your hairbrush is not necessarily cause for alarm. At any time, about 90% of the hair on a person's scalp is growing. Each follicle has its own life cycle that can be influenced by age, disease, and a wide variety of other factors. This life cycle is divided into three phases: Anagen: active hair growth that generally lasts between 2 to 8 years Catagen: transitional hair growth that lasts 2 to 3 weeks Telogen: resting phase that lasts about 2 to 3 months; at the end of the resting phase the hair is shed and a new hair replaces it, and the growing cycle starts again. As people age, their rate of hair growth slows. There are many types of hair loss, also called alopecia: Involutional alopecia is a natural condition in which the hair gradually thins with age. More hair follicles go into the resting phase, and the remaining hairs become shorter and fewer in number. Androgenic alopecia is a genetic condition that can affect both men and women. Men with this condition, called male pattern baldness , can begin having hair loss as early as their teens or early 20s. It's characterized by a receding hairline and gradual disappearance of hair from the crown and frontal scalp. Women with this condition, called female pattern baldness, don't have noticeable thinning until their 40s or later. Women experience a general thinning over the entire scalp, with the most extensive hair loss at the crown. Alopecia areata often starts suddenly and causes patchy hair loss in children and young adults. This condition may result in complete baldness (alopecia totalis). But in about 90% of people with the condition, the hair returns within a few years. Alopecia universalis causes all body hair to fall out, including the eyebrows, eyelashes, and pubic hair. Trichotillomania , seen most frequently in children, is a psychological disorder in which a person pulls out their own hair. Telogen effluvium is temporary hair thinning over the scalp that occurs because of changes in the growth cycle of hair. A large number of hairs enter the resting phase at the same time, causing hair shedding and subsequent thinning. Learn more about what causes telogen effluvium. Scarring alopecias result in permanent loss of hair. Inflammatory skin conditions  (cellulitis, folliculitis, acne), and other skin disorders (such as some forms of lupus and lichen planus) often result in scars that destroy the ability of the hair to regenerate. Traction alopecia. Hot combs and hair too tightly woven and pulled can also result in permanent hair loss. Central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia. This is the most common type among Black women. This often manifests as a small bald patch in the center of the scalp that grows over time. Hair Loss Causes Doctors don't know why certain hair follicles are programmed to have a shorter growth period than others. However, several factors may influence hair loss: Hormones , such as abnormal levels of androgens (male hormones normally produced by both men and women) Genes , from both male and female parents, may influence a person's predisposition to male or female pattern baldness. Stress, illness, and childbirth can cause temporary hair loss. Ringworm caused by a fungal infection can also cause hair loss. Learn what you can do to help reverse hair loss caused by stress. Drugs , including chemotherapy drugs used in cancer treatment, blood thinners, beta-adrenergic blockers used to control blood pressure, and birth control pills, can cause temporary hair loss. Burns, injuries, and X-rays can cause temporary hair loss. In such cases, normal hair growth usually returns once the injury heals unless a scar is produced. Then, hair will never regrow. Autoimmune disease may cause alopecia areata. In alopecia areata, the immune system revs up for unknown reasons and affects the hair follicles. In most people with alopecia areata, the hair grows back, although it may temporarily be very fine and possibly a lighter color before normal coloration and thickness return. Cosmetic procedures , such as shampooing too often, perms, bleaching, and dyeing hair can contribute to overall hair thinning by making hair weak and brittle. Tight braiding, using rollers or hot curlers, and running hair picks through tight curls can also damage and break hair. However, these procedures don't cause baldness. In most instances hair grows back normally if the source of the problem is removed. Still, severe damage to the hair or scalp sometimes causes permanent bald patches. Medical conditions. Thyroid disease, lupus, diabetes, iron deficiency anemia, eating disorders, and anemia can cause hair loss. Most times, when the underlying condition is treated, the hair will return unless there is scarring as in some forms of lupus, lichen planus, or follicular disorders. Diet. A low- protein diet or severely calorie-restricted diet can also cause temporary hair loss. Get information about foods that can help prevent hair loss. Vitamin deficiencies. Deficiencies in vitamins A, B, C, D, and E, as well as iron and zinc, have been associated with hair loss."
9,What Is Balo’s Disease?,"Most doctors think of Balo’s disease as a rare form of multiple sclerosis (MS). MS attacks and damages tissue in your brain and spinal cord, which causes lesions (areas of inflamed tissue). Balo’s disease damages that tissue, too, and it causes lesions in your brain and spinal cord. The difference is that the lesions caused by MS look like blotches or spots, but the ones caused by Balo’s disease look like bull's-eye marks. Because of this, Balo’s disease is sometimes known as Balo’s concentric sclerosis -- the bull's-eye-shaped scars are concentric rings. Another difference between the two conditions is that many people who have MS have periods of time when their symptoms let up. But most people who have Balo’s disease don’t get a break from their symptoms, and their health gets worse over time. Balo’s disease is most common among Asian people, especially people from China and the Philippines. Adults are more likely to get it than children, and it can affect both men and women. People often get the disease in their 30s. Symptoms Many signs of Balo’s disease are similar to MS symptoms . They can include: Headaches Seizures Muscle pain and spasms Muscle weakness Paralysis over time Trouble speaking Trouble thinking or understanding others Changes in behavior Causes Doctors aren’t sure what triggers Balo’s disease. They think it’s a type of autoimmune condition, which is when your body mistakenly attacks healthy tissue and makes it swollen or inflamed. Some people who get Balo’s disease have an illness with a high fever and severe headaches right before they notice other symptoms. Because of this, doctors think it may be linked to an infection, though no one knows for sure. Diagnosis Because Balo’s disease is very rare, it’s best to see a doctor who specializes in problems of the brain and nervous system (a neurologist ). They’ll ask about your medical history and your symptoms. They’ll also give you a physical exam to see how well you move and if some of your muscles are weaker than others. And they’ll check to see how good your memory is and how well you speak. They’ll order a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of your brain and spinal cord to check for lesions. That uses powerful magnets and radio waves to make detailed pictures of the inside of your body. You also may have blood tests to check for an infection, or your doctor may take a small amount of spinal fluid from your lower back for testing. In some cases, your doctor might suggest an evoked potential (EP) test. A technician will put small patches on your scalp that connect wires to a machine that measures the activity in your brain . They’ll then ask you to watch, listen, or feel certain things (like light patterns, a series of clicks, or short electrical bursts) and see how your brain responds to them. Treatment There is no cure for Balo’s disease, and no medications have been designed to treat it. Your doctor may prescribe some of the same drugs used to treat MS along with steroids (corticosteroids) to help with swelling in your brain and spinal cord tissue. You also may get medicine to help ease pain or muscle problems, like weakness or spasms."
10,"Barrett's Esophagus: Symptoms, Causes, and Treatments","What is Barrett's Esophagus? Barrett's esophagus is a condition in which normal tissue lining of your esophagus – the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach – becomes more like the lining of your intestine, or thicker and red. Experts suspect that damage from acid reflux may be linked to the condition. A few things happen in your body that result in Barrett's esophagus. Between the esophagus and the stomach, there is a valve called the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). It keeps stomach contents from rising up into the esophagus and prevents a back flow (reflux) of stomach acid. Over time, the LES can begin to stop working and lead to acid and chemical damage of the esophagus, called gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ). In people with chronic symptoms of GERD , the acid reflux of GERD can then damage the esophageal lining, causing Barrett's esophagus. Who gets Barrett's disease? In North America, there are about 30 million people who have GERD, the most common long-term gastrointestinal disease. Barrett's esophagus will happen in about 5% of patients with ongoing GERD or esophagus inflammation. Most people with acid reflux don't develop Barrett's esophagus. But in patients with frequent acid reflux, the normal cells in the esophagus may eventually be replaced by cells that are similar to cells in the intestine to become Barrett's esophagus. Also, not everyone with GERD develops Barrett's esophagus. And not everyone with Barrett's esophagus has GERD. But long-term GERD is the primary risk factor. Barrett's esophagus is a condition in which normal tissue lining the esophagus – the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach – becomes thicker and red. Experts suspect that damage from acid reflux may be linked to the condition. (Photo Credit: Ihor Vinicenko/Dreamstime) Barrett's Esophagus Symptoms Barrett's esophagus does not have any specific symptoms, although people with Barrett's esophagus may have symptoms similar to those who have GERD , which can include: Trouble swallowing food Frequent heartburn Chest pain A sour or burning feeling in the throat An ongoing cough Blood in their poop Weight loss Nausea Laryngitis Barrett's Esophagus Risk Factors While the condition is rare overall, there are a number of things that can make you more likely to get Barrett’s esophagus. One is the start of GERD at a younger age, if you've had heartburn symptoms for 10 years or more. Other risk factors include: Obesity . High levels of belly fat, in particular, may raise your chances of Barrett's esophagus. Smoking . This causes more stomach acid production and causes your body to make less saliva, which offsets acid. Smoking also weakens the LES. Your family history . Some studies point to your genetics, or inherited genes passed down through your family, as a potential risk factor for Barrett's esophagus. Age . While being over 50 raises your chances of Barrett's esophagus, most people are in their 60s when they're diagnosed with the condition. The average age at diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus is 55 years. Long-term GERD . This is a top risk factor. Experts believe the acidic reflux irritates the lining of the esophagus, leading to changes in the tissue that can result in Barrett's esophagus. Your sex . Men are three to four times more likely to get Barrett's esophagus than women. Your race . Non-Hispanic white people are more likely to get the condition. How Is Barrett's Esophagus Diagnosed? Because there are often no specific symptoms linked to Barrett's esophagus, it can only be diagnosed with an upper endoscopy and biopsy . Guidelines from the American Gastroenterological Association recommend screening in people who have multiple risk factors for Barrett’s esophagus. To perform an endoscopy, a doctor called a gastroenterologist inserts a long flexible tube with a camera attached down the throat into the esophagus after giving the patient a sedative. The process may feel a little uncomfortable, but it isn't painful. Most people have little or no problem with it. Once the tube is inserted, the doctor can visually inspect the lining of the esophagus. Barrett's esophagus, if it's there, is visible on camera, but the diagnosis requires a biopsy . The doctor will remove a small sample of tissue to be examined under a microscope in the laboratory to confirm a diagnosis. The sample will also be examined for the presence of precancerous cells or cancer. If the biopsy confirms the presence of Barrett's esophagus, your doctor will probably recommend a follow-up endoscopy and biopsy to examine more tissue for early signs of cancer. If you have Barrett's esophagus but no cancer or precancerous cells are found, the doctor will still most likely recommend that you have periodic endoscopies. This is a precaution, because cancer can develop in tissue years after Barrett's esophagus is diagnosed. If precancerous cells are present in the biopsy, your doctor will discuss treatment options with you. Complications A diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus is not a cause for major alarm. But Barrett's esophagus can lead to precancerous changes in a small number of people. If you have Barrett's esophagus, there is a very small increase in the risk of getting esophageal adenocarcinoma , which is a serious, potentially fatal cancer of the esophagus (less than 1% of people with Barrett's esophagus). You'll want to have regular checkups so your doctor can look for precancerous and cancer cells early, before they can spread and when the disease is easier to treat. Barrett's Esophagus Treatments A main focus of treatment for Barrett's esophagus is to prevent or slow the development of the condition, which can be achieved with certain procedures and medications. Several treatments, including surgery, are designed specifically to focus on the abnormal tissue. They will vary, depending on your overall health and the presence of precancerous cells, or dysplasia, in your esophagus. No dysplasia Normal endoscopy. This is a procedure in which your doctor will send a lighted tube with a camera at the end – also known as an endoscope – down your throat to check your esophagus. Your doctor will likely want you to have an endoscopy every 2 to 3 years. Your doctor may also prescribe medications or other things that are commonly used to treat GERD to help, which could include: Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) that block the production of stomach acid and help control GERD symptoms long-term. They can also prevent further damage to your esophagus and, in some cases, heal existing damage. Antacids to neutralize stomach acid. These are particularly helpful for occasional reflux. Antacids can worsen the problem if taken too much, because they tend to cause your body to make more acid. Histamine 2 (H2) blockers that lessen the release of stomach acid. These also heal esophagus damage in about 50% of people. Promotility agents , which are drugs that speed up the movement of food from the stomach to the intestines. They may be coupled with antacids. Baclofen , which is a muscle relaxer, may reduce how often you have acid reflux. GERD treatment . Your doctor may consider anti-reflux surgery if you have GERD symptoms and medicines aren't working for you. This could include procedures to correct hiatal hernia or to tighten the LES. Low-grade dysplasia If you're diagnosed with low-grade dysplasia – the early stage of precancerous changes – it means only some of your cells are abnormal, but most are not. Your doctor could recommend more checkups, about every six months to a year, to check for more changes. They may also suggest ablation therapy, which is a minimally invasive procedure to destroy abnormal tissue. High-grade dysplasia This form of dysplasia is known as the precursor to esophageal cancer. Your doctor may recommend more frequent checkups and treatment to remove damaged tissue, including: Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) . This most common procedure uses radio waves delivered through an endoscope inserted into the esophagus to destroy abnormal or cancerous cells in the Barrett's tissue while protecting the healthy cells underneath. Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) . EMR lifts the abnormal lining and cuts it off the wall of the esophagus before it's removed through the endoscope. The goal is to remove any precancerous or cancer cells contained in the lining. If cancer cells are present, an ultrasound is done first to be sure the cancer hasn't moved deeper into the esophagus walls. Endoscopic spray cryotherapy . This is a newer technique that applies cold nitrogen or carbon dioxide gas through the endoscope to freeze and destroy the abnormal cells. Photodynamic therapy (PDT). A laser through an endoscope kills abnormal cells in the lining without damaging normal tissue. Before the procedure, the patient takes a drug known as Photofrin, which causes cells to become light-sensitive. Your doctor may combine this with endoscopic mucosal resection. Surgery . There are a couple of ways your doctor could use surgery as treatment. They may remove the affected part of your esophagus, then rebuild it from part of your stomach or large intestine. Removing most of the esophagus is an option in cases where severe precancer (dysplasia) or cancer has been diagnosed. The earlier the surgery is done after the diagnosis, the better the chance for the cure. Lifestyle and Home Remedies Another treatment goal is to control acid reflux, which can be done with lifestyle changes. You can try to: Make changes in your diet. Fatty foods, chocolate , caffeine , spicy foods, and peppermint can aggravate reflux. Avoid alcohol, caffeinated drinks, and tobacco . Lose weight. Being overweight increases your risk of reflux because extra weight around your belly can compress the stomach and cause acid to rise into the esophagus. Sleep with the head of the bed elevated. Sleeping with your head raised may help prevent the acid in your stomach from flowing up into the esophagus. Rework your eating schedule. Eat multiple small meals often instead of a few large ones, and wait at least 3 hours after you eat before you lie down. Take all medicines with plenty of water."
11,Bartholin’s Cyst: What is it?,"What Is a Bartholin's Cyst? A Bartholin’s cyst, also called a Bartholin’s gland cyst, is a small fluid-filled lump (cyst) that can form on one or both sides of the vaginal opening, where the Bartholin’s glands are. The glands are small, about the size of a pea, but you usually can’t notice them. Their role is to produce lubricating vaginal fluid. The fluid travels to the vagina through ducts (tubes). Occasionally, one or both Bartholin glands become blocked and cause the fluid to build up, forming a cyst . These cysts are common among people of childbearing age, affecting about 2 of every 10 women. Bartholin's cysts mostly occur on one side, but some people get them on both sides. They're almost always benign, or not cancer. The cysts aren’t always obvious and are sometimes only found during a medical exam. A Bartholin’s gland cyst is a small fluid-filled lump (cyst) that can form on one or both sides of the vaginal opening. You may not know you have the cyst because there aren’t always symptoms. (Photo credit: Moment/Getty Images) Bartholin Abscess Occasionally, a Bartholin’s cyst can become infected. If this happens, the gland fills with pus. This is called a Bartholin’s gland abscess. Unlike a cyst, an abscess is firm and painful and can interfere with your everyday life. Bartholin’s Cyst Symptoms You may not know you have a Bartholin’s cyst because there aren’t always symptoms. If the cyst gets infected, it can become tender, swollen, and red. It can be filled with fluid and range in size from a pea to a golf ball. You may have irritation, discomfort, or pain when walking, sitting, wiping after using the toilet, or having sexual intercourse. It also could be painful to insert or remove tampons. Other symptoms of an infected Bartholin's cyst include: Swelling in the area Redness Drainage Growth in size Fever and chills (if you have an abscess) If the cyst is large, it can make one side of your labia majora (the large folds of skin on the outside of your vagina) hang lower than the other. Causes of Bartholin’s Cyst It isn’t always clear why the Bartholin’s glands get blocked. A blockage could result from long-term irritation, but it can also be caused by: Injury to the area or after childbirth, with or without an episiotomy Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) like gonorrhea or chlamydia (in rare cases) Bacterial infections like E. coli. Most Bartholin's cysts do not become infected and aren't contagious upon skin-to-skin contact. Cysts that are caused by STIs, however, can be spread. The cysts typically happen in your childbearing years but, in rare cases, can occur after menopause. They’re less likely to develop as you age. People who are postmenopausal should have vaginal lumps checked. Bartholin's Cyst Risk Factors Any person with a vagina can develop a Bartholin’s cyst or abscess, but some may be more likely to develop one (or more). This includes those who: Are in their 20s or 30s Have been exposed to an STI Have had a trauma or injury to the area Have had a previous Bartholin's cyst Bartholin’s Cyst Diagnosis Only your doctor can tell you if you have a Bartholin’s cyst. They’ll do a pelvic exam to check the vaginal opening and to feel for a bump. If you have drainage, they’ll take a sample so it can be looked at under a microscope for signs of an STI or other bacterial infection. If you have an abscess, they’ll take a sample from it and send that to a lab. If you’re over 40, they may do a biopsy (take a sample of tissue from the cyst) to rule out vulvar cancer . Vulvar cancer from a Bartholin’s cyst is rare, affecting only about 5% of women (5 out of every 100)  who have vulvar cancer. It's more common for the Bartholin's gland to develop into cancer if you are over age 60. If your doctor determines your cyst may be cancerous, they may recommend having it removed by surgery. Bartholin's Cyst Home Treatment You probably won’t need medical treatment if you’re under 40, your cyst isn’t causing problems, and you aren’t showing any signs of an infection. Most Bartholin’s cysts go away on their own, usually within a few weeks. But if you’re uncomfortable, there are a few things you can try at home. Warm compresses. Apply a clean cotton cloth soaked with warm water to the area until the cloth cools. A sitz bath : Fill a tub with 3 to 4 inches of clean, warm water (enough to cover your vulva), and gently sit. Repeat this several times a day for 3 or 4 days. The cyst may burst and drain on its own. Over-the-counter pain relievers. If you are experiencing pain, taking an over-the-counter painkiller as directed may help ease the discomfort. While treating your cyst at home, it may drain or burst. This is OK, but do not try to pop the cyst on your own as this could lead to infection. If the cyst is that bothersome, you should see your doctor. Will a Bartholin's cyst go away on its own? Bartholin's cysts usually do go away on their own. To lessen infection risks, it's important to keep the area clean and dry and to avoid squeezing or popping the cyst. If the cyst becomes painful or infected or does not go away or improve over several weeks, talk to your doctor. Bartholin’s Cyst Treatment If your exam shows that you have an STI, or if your cyst is infected, your doctor will prescribe an antibiotic. They may also prescribe topical medications to put on your skin. If the Bartholin’s cyst is causing problems -- or if it’s turned into an abscess -- you’ll need to see your doctor. They’ll treat it in one of the following ways: Surgical drainage. The doctor will make a tiny cut in the cyst. They’ll place a small rubber tube (called a catheter) into the opening to allow it to drain. It can stay in place for up to 6 weeks. You’ll probably feel better right away after the fluid is gone. But you may need to take pain medication for several days afterward. Keep in mind that a Bartholin's cyst or abscess may come back and need treatment again. Side effects include pain or discomfort, especially during sex. You might also have swelling of the labia (lips around the vagina), infection, bleeding, or scarring. Balloon-tipped catheter. Your doctor may choose to use a balloon-tipped catheter. This procedure is done in the doctor’s office. After making a small cut, they insert a small balloon-tipped catheter into the cyst. It remains in place for 4 to 6 weeks and encourages the body to form a permanent opening for any future drainage. You will be able to perform your usual activities, although sexual activity may be uncomfortable and discouraged while the catheter is in place. Marsupialization. If cysts bother you or come back, this procedure may help. The doctor cuts the cyst open, then stitches the skin around it to form a small pouch. This lets the fluid drain out. The doctor will pack the area with special gauze to soak up the fluid and any blood. The process takes less than half an hour, and you can go home the same day. Your doctor may prescribe painkillers afterward. There’s also a risk of infection, bleeding, and the abscess coming back. Removing the gland. Your doctor might recommend this option if others haven’t worked or you keep getting Bartholin’s cysts and abscesses. This surgery takes about an hour. You’ll get anesthesia to put you to sleep during the procedure, and you may be able to go home afterward. Possible problems include bleeding, bruising, and infection. Needle aspiration. Some research suggests simple needle aspiration can be effective in Bartholin's abscesses and can be done as on outpatient procedure without the need for general anesthesia. Carbon dioxide laser. This minimally invasive surgical treatment option that uses a laser to remove a Bartholin's cyst. It is quick and can be done as an outpatient procedure, but it can be expensive. Bartholin’s Cyst Prevention You can’t prevent a Bartholin’s cyst. But safer sex measures like using condoms may help prevent an infection or cyst caused by an STI. Practicing good hygiene can also help."
12,What Is Bartter Syndrome?,"Bartter syndrome is a group of similar rare conditions that affect the kidneys . It's genetic, which means it's caused by a problem with a gene. If you have it, too much salt and calcium leave your body when you pee. It also may cause low levels of potassium and high levels of acid in the blood . If all these are out of balance, you can have many different health problems. There are two major forms of Bartter syndrome. Antenatal Bartter syndrome starts before birth. It can be very serious, even life threatening. Babies may not grow as they should in the womb, or they may be born too early. The other form is called classic. It usually starts in early childhood and isn't as severe as the antenatal form. But it can affect growth and cause developmental delays. Gitelman syndrome is a subtype of Bartter syndrome. It tends to happen later -- usually from age 6 through adulthood. Symptoms Symptoms can be different for everyone, even for people with the same condition. Some common ones include: Constipation Frequent urination Generally feeling unwell Muscle weakness and cramping Salt cravings Severe thirst Slower than normal growth and development Antenatal Bartter syndrome may be diagnosed before birth. It can be found if there are signs the baby's kidneys aren't working right or there's too much fluid in the womb. Newborns with this form of the syndrome may pee very often and can have: Dangerously high fevers Dehydration Vomiting and diarrhea Unusual facial features such as triangle-shaped face, large forehead, large pointed ears Lack of normal growth Deafness at birth Causes Genes carry instructions that help your body work right. Genetic diseases can happen when there's a change in the gene (called a mutation). At least five genes are linked to Bartter syndrome, and they all play an important role in how your kidneys work -- especially in your ability to take in salt. Losing too much salt through pee (salt wasting) can affect how your kidneys take in other substances, including potassium and calcium. A lack of balance in these elements can lead to serious problems: Too little salt can cause dehydration , constipation , and frequent peeing. Too little calcium can weaken bones and cause frequent kidney stones. Low blood levels of potassium can cause muscle weakness, cramping, and fatigue . Diagnosis and Treatment For children with symptoms of classic Bartter syndrome, a doctor will do a thorough exam along with blood and urine tests. The antenatal form can be diagnosed before birth by testing the amniotic fluid in the womb. Genetic testing may also be done. Your child's doctor will take blood and possibly small samples of tissue so a specialist can look for mutations. Once your child is diagnosed, their care may involve a team of specialists, including pediatricians, kidney experts, and social workers. To make sure they keep a healthy balance of fluids and other important things, one or several of these may be recommended: Indomethacin, an anti-inflammatory drug that helps their body make less urine Potassium-sparing diuretics, which help them keep potassium RAAS inhibitors, which help keep them from losing potassium Calcium , potassium or magnesium supplements or a combination of them Food high in salt, water , and potassium Fluids put directly into a vein (for infants with severe forms) Because there's no cure, people who have Bartter syndrome will need to take certain medications or supplements for life."
13,Basal Cell Carcinoma,"What Is Basal Cell Carcinoma? Basal cell carcinoma is a cancer that grows on parts of your skin that get a lot of sun. It's natural to feel worried when your doctor tells you that you have it, but keep in mind that it's the least risky type of skin cancer. As long as you catch it early, you can be cured. The tumors start off as small shiny bumps, usually on your nose or other parts of your face. But you can get them on any part of your body, including your trunk, legs, and arms. This cancer is unlikely to spread from your skin to other parts of your body, but it can move nearby into bone or other tissue under your skin. Several treatments can keep that from happening and get rid of the cancer . Basal cell carcinoma usually grows very slowly and often doesn't show up for many years after intense or long-term exposure to the sun. You can get it at a younger age if you're exposed to a lot of sun or use tanning beds. If you've got fair skin, you're more likely to get it. Melanoma vs. basal cell carcinoma Basal cell carcinoma starts in the deepest part of your skin's outer layer, the epidermis. Melanoma starts in cells called melanocytes. They make melanin, the pigment that gives your skin its color. Melanin is also your body's natural defense against the sun damaging the deeper layers of your skin. Melanoma is much less common than basal cell carcinoma, but it's more likely to spread if not treated., Basal cell carcinoma usually starts as a smooth tumor with tiny blood vessels, often on your nose. It can show up differently on different skin colors. It's the least risky form of skin cancer, but treatment is important to stop it from spreading. (Photo credit: Richard Usatine, MD) Basal Cell Carcinoma Symptoms Basal cell carcinomas can have different looks. Here are five warning signs to watch for: An open sore that doesn't heal. It might ooze liquid or blood or form a crust. It might go away and then come back. A reddish, irritated-looking patch of skin. This could be on your face, chest, shoulder, arm, or leg. It might not bother you at all. Or it could itch or form a crust. A shiny bump. On white skin, it might appear pearly, clear, pink, red, or white. On darker skin, it might be tan, black or brown. If you have darker skin, you might mistake it for a mole. A small pink growth with a slightly raised edge and a crusty dent in the middle. You might see tiny blood vessels on the surface. An area that looks like a scar. It could be white, yellow, or waxy. The skin may be shiny and tight. The area might not have obvious borders. What happens if you pick at a basal cell carcinoma? Basal cell carcinomas are fragile and can bleed easily. Basal Cell Carcinoma Causes Basal cell carcinoma is the most common form of skin cancer accounting for 90% of skin cancers in the U.S. It is caused by sun damage. BCC causes small bumps and sometimes open sores on the skin. It is slow growing, and if not removed can spread into underlying tissues. Ultraviolet (UV) rays from the sun or from an indoor tanning bed are the main cause of basal cell carcinoma. When UV rays hit your skin, over time, they can damage the DNA in your skin cells. The DNA holds the code for the way these cells grow. Over time, damage to the DNA can cause cancer to form. The process takes many years. Basal Cell Carcinoma Risk Factors Knowing your risk factors can help you avoid basal cell carcinoma or catch it early if you have it. Among the things that can increase your risk: Exposure to UV rays, either from the sun or indoor tanning History of skin cancer, including other types such as squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma Your age. People older than 50 get basal cell carcinoma more often. Fair skin. Anyone can get basal cell carcinoma. But the chances are higher if you have skin that burns or freckles easily. Being a man or assigned male at birth. Women, or people assigned female at birth, are less likely to get basal cell carcinoma. Ongoing skin infections and inflammation from burns, scars, or other problems. Basal Cell Carcinoma Diagnosis Your doctor will look at your skin for growths. You might have to answer questions such as: Did you spend a lot of time in the sun while you were growing up? Have you had blistering sunburns? Do you use sunscreen ? Have you ever used indoor tanning beds? Have you had unusual bleeding spots on your skin that don't heal? Your doctor will take a sample, or biopsy , of the growth. That means numbing the area and removing some of the skin. Then the sample goes to a lab, where it will be tested for cancer cells. Questions for Your Doctor What kind of treatments do you suggest? Can drugs help treat my condition? Will I need surgery? How can I keep from getting skin cancer again? Basal Cell Carcinoma Treatment The goal is to get rid of the cancer while leaving as small a scar as possible. To choose the best treatment, your doctor will consider the size and place of the cancer, and how long you've had it. Your overall health will play a role in your treatment plan, too. These are some of the treatment options your doctor may suggest: Cutting out the tumor. Your doctor may call this an ""excision."" First they'll numb the tumor and the skin around it. Then they'll scrape the tumor with a spoon-shaped device. Next they'll cut out the tumor and a small surrounding area of normal-appearing skin and send it to a lab. If the lab results show there are cancer cells in the area around your tumor, your doctor may need to remove more of your skin. Scraping the tumor away and using electricity to kill cancer cells . You may hear your doctor call this ""curettage and desiccation."" First your doctor numbs your skin. Then they use a curette, a tool that has a spoon-like shape to scrape off the tumor. Your doctor controls your bleeding and kills any other cancer cells with an electric needle. Freezing your cancer cells. This is known as ""cryosurgery."" Your doctor kills your cancer cells by freezing them with liquid nitrogen. Radiation therapy . This treatment uses X-rays to destroy your cancer cells. It's done over several weeks. Mohs surgery. This is a technique that's named after the doctor who invented it. Your surgeon removes your tumor layer by layer. They take out some tissue, then look at it under a microscope to see if it has cancer cells, before moving on to the next layer. Your doctor may recommend this surgery if your tumor is: Large In a sensitive area of your body Has been there for a long time Came back after you had other treatments Creams and pills. Your doctor may suggest some medicine that can treat your basal cell carcinoma. Two creams that you put on your skin are: Fluorouracil (5-FU) Imiquimod You may need to apply these creams for several weeks. Your doctor will check you regularly to see how well they're working. There's also a pill that your doctor might prescribe called sonidegib ( Odomzo ) or vismodegib ( Erivedge ). You're most likely to get one of these drugs if your basal cell carcinoma has spread to other parts of your body. Other treatments include laser surgery or photodynamic therapy. Taking Care of Yourself After you've been treated for basal cell carcinoma, you'll need to take some steps to lower your chance of getting cancer again. Check your skin . Keep an eye out for new growths. Some signs of cancer include areas of skin that are growing, changing, or bleeding. Check your skin regularly with a hand-held mirror and a full-length mirror so that you can get a good view of all parts of your body. Avoid too much sun. Stay out of sunlight between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., when the sun's UVB burning rays are strongest. Use sunscreen . The sun’s UVA rays are present all day long -- that’s why you need daily sunscreen. Make sure you apply sunscreen with at least 6% zinc oxide and a sun protection factor of 30 to all parts of your skin that aren't covered up with clothes every day. You also need to reapply it every 60 to 80 minutes when outside. Dress right . Wear a broad-brimmed hat and cover up as much as possible, such as long-sleeved shirts and long pants. Prognosis Basal cell carcinoma rarely spreads to other parts of the body, and the treatment is almost always successful, especially if it's caught early. Sometimes new carcinomas can grow, so it's important to check your skin for any unusual-looking growths and get them checked by your doctor. Getting Support Learn more about basal cell carcinoma, including pictures of skin tumors, on the web site of the American Cancer Society . Takeaways Basal cell carcinoma is the most common type of skin cancer. If you catch it early, treatment usually works. You may be at risk for more skin cancer in the future, though. So you'll need to take precautions against the sun and watch your skin for changes. Basal Cell Carcinoma FAQs How serious is basal cell skin cancer? Basal cell carcinoma doesn't usually go beyond the original spot. But if it isn't treated, it can spread there, growing wide and deep. Basal cell carcinoma can destroy tissue and bone if not treated for an extended period of time. If you wait to get treatment, that could make it more likely you'll have more skin cancer in the future. Can basal cell carcinoma turn into cancer? Basal cell carcinoma is itself a form of cancer. It rarely spreads to other parts of the body (metastasizes), such as lymph nodes or bones. If you have frequent cases of basal cell carcinoma, that could mean you're at greater risk for cancer of the breast, prostate, or colon. Researchers don't fully understand how the link works. What stage of cancer is basal cell carcinoma? Doctors don't usually assign a stage to basal cell carcinoma. Staging is most important for cancers that are likely to spread, and basal cell carcinoma rarely does. When the carcinoma is unusually thick or has spread to deeper levels of the skin, then the doctor will stage it based on factors such as size, location, and how it has spread."
14,Caring for Your Teeth and Gums,"With proper care, your teeth and gums can stay healthy throughout your life. The healthier your teeth and gums are, the less risk you have for tooth decay and gum disease . How Should I Care for My Teeth and Gums? There are five basic steps to caring for teeth and gums: Brushing Flossing Rinsing Eating right Visiting the dentist To keep your teeth and gums healthy, it's important to have regular check-ups and professional cleanings. You should also see your dentist if you have pain in your teeth, pain in your mouth, or bleeding, swollen gums. Tips for Brushing Teeth Brush at least twice a day. If you can, brush after every meal. Ideally wait 30 minutes after eating; this will allow any enamel that softened from acid during eating to re-harden and not get brushed away. Brushing removes plaque , a film of bacteria that clings to teeth. When bacteria in plaque come into contact with food, they produce acids. These acids lead to cavities . To brush: Place a pea-sized dab of fluoride toothpaste on the head of the toothbrush . (Use a soft toothbrush.) Place the toothbrush against the teeth at a 45-degree angle up to the gum line. Move the brush across the teeth using a small circular motion. Continue with this motion cleaning one tooth at a time. Keep the tips of the bristles against the gum line. Avoid pressing so hard that the bristles lie flat against the teeth. (Only the tips of the toothbrush clean the teeth.) Let the bristles reach into spaces between teeth. Brush across the top of the chewing surfaces of the teeth. Make sure the bristles get into the grooves and crevices. Use the same small circular motion to clean the backside of the upper and lower teeth – the side that faces the tongue . To clean the inside of the bottom front teeth, angle the head in an up-and-down position toward the bottom inside of the mouth and move the toothbrush in a small circle. For the inside of the top front teeth, angle the brush in an up-and-down position with the tip of the head pointing toward the roof of the mouth . Move the toothbrush in a small circle. Give your tongue a few gentle brush strokes, brushing from the back of your tongue forward. Do not scrub. This helps remove bacteria and freshens your breath. After brushing your teeth for 2 to 3 minutes, rinse your mouth with water. Replace your toothbrush with a new one every 3 to 4 months. You can wear down your enamel if you brush too fast and hard. Hold a brush with a soft bristle at about a 45-degree angle to your gums. Then move it back and forth in short, gentle strokes, about the distance of one tooth. Wait for up to an hour after eating sweets or citrus fruits before you brush your teeth. Acidic foods can soften enamel and may make it easier for you to damage it. Tips for Flossing Your Teeth Floss teeth at least once a day. Flossing gets rid of food and plaque between the teeth, where your toothbrush cannot reach. If plaque stays between teeth, it can harden into tartar , which must be removed by a dentist or hygienist. To floss: Remove about an 18-inch strip of floss from the dispenser. Wind the floss around the middle fingers of each hand, leaving a 1-inch section open for flossing. Floss the top teeth first, then the bottom. Place the floss in your mouth and use your index fingers to push the floss between the teeth. Be careful not to push too hard and injure the gums. Move the floss up and down against the tooth and up and around the gum line. The floss should form a C-shape around the tooth as you floss. Floss between each tooth as well as behind the back teeth. Use a clean section of floss as needed, and take up used floss by winding it around the fingers. Tips for Rinsing Your Mouth Mouthwashes do more than just freshen your breath. Rinse with an antiseptic mouthwash at least once a day to kill bacteria that cause plaque and early gum disease . A fluoride rinse can help prevent tooth decay and cavities. Some rinses can do both. It doesn't matter if you rinse before or after you brush. Swish the mouthwash in your mouth for 30 to 60 seconds. Eating Right for Dental Health For good dental health, eat a variety of foods, but minimize those that contain sugars and starches. These foods produce the most acids in the mouth, and the longer they stay in the mouth, the more they can damage the teeth. Hard ""sucking candies"" are especially harmful because they stay in the mouth a long time. Snacking on sugary foods can lead to tooth decay, because most people don't brush after snacks. Starchy snack foods, like potato chips, stick to the teeth. Avoid snacking on: Candies, cookies, cakes, and pie Sugary gum Crackers, breadsticks, and chips Dried fruits and raisins Calcium in food counters acids in your mouth that cause decay. It also helps keep your bones and teeth strong. Milk, cheese, and other dairy products help protect and strengthen enamel. Choose low-fat or fat-free items to help keep calories down. If you don't eat dairy, look for foods with calcium added. Visit Your Dentist Regularly Visit your dentist at least once every 6 months. To keep your teeth and gums healthy, it's important to have regular check-ups and professional cleanings. You should also see your dentist if you have pain in your teeth, pain in your mouth, or bleeding, swollen gums . You can also ask your dentist about dental sealants . A sealant is a material used to coat the top, chewing surfaces of the teeth. This coating protects the tooth from decay and usually lasts a long time, but can only be placed on a tooth without decay. It is usually placed on children’s teeth as they get their permanent teeth. If you have severe heartburn, stomach acids may escape and eventually reach your mouth, where they can erode (damage) enamel. The eating disorder bulimia, in which people vomit food after they eat, is another threat to your enamel. If you have either condition, talk to your doctor about treatment. Beware of Chlorinated Pools When swimming pools aren't chlorinated properly, the water may become too acidic. When that happens, the water can damage teeth that get wet. Check with the recreation center or gym where you swim to make sure the pool's chlorine levels are checked regularly. While swimming , keep your mouth closed so your teeth don’t get wet. Watch Out for Dry Mouth Saliva helps wash away food and bacteria that can lead to cavities. It also fights the effects of acidic foods. Drink water often to keep your mouth clean and moist. If you exercise hard, be sure to rehydrate during and after your workout . Chewing sugarless gum or sucking on sugarless hard candy can also help keep saliva flowing in your mouth. Some medical conditions and medications can cause dry mouth . Talk to your doctor about treatments. Avoid Grinding Your Teeth Some people grind their upper and lower teeth together, especially at night. Over time, it can wear down the enamel. Talk to your dentist if you've got the grinding habit. They may suggest a custom-fitted mouth guard that can protect your teeth."
15,Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP): An Overview,"What Is a Comprehensive Metabolic Panel? A comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) is a series of 14 blood tests. It gives your doctor a snapshot of how your liver and kidneys are working, your blood sugar (glucose) level, and your electrolyte and fluid balance. A CMP is a standard blood test that measures your blood sugar levels, how your kidneys and liver function, and your electrolyte and fluid levels. (Photo Credits: iStock/Getty Images) The 14 tests include alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), bilirubin, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, sodium, potassium, carbon dioxide, chloride, albumin, total protein, glucose, and calcium . It’s also called a metabolic panel, chem 14, chemistry panel, or chemistry screen. Comprehensive metabolic panel vs. basic metabolic panel The doctor may test you with a basic metabolic panel (BMP) instead of a CMP based on your health history and your needs. A BMP can help your doctor understand how your body is using your food and how the chemicals in your body are balanced. It includes eight of the same tests as a CMP: BUN, creatinine, carbon dioxide, chloride, potassium, sodium, glucose, and calcium. Your doctor may order this instead of a CMP: As part of your regular checkup When you go to the ER When you have some long-term conditions, such as high blood pressure or kidney disease It's also called a chem 7 or electrolyte panel. Why Are Comprehensive Metabolic Panels Done? You may get a CMP as part of your yearly checkup, or you may get it to check for kidney or liver diseases. The doctor might also want one to check you for any medical problems, keep track of any chronic conditions you have, or make sure certain medications aren’t hurting your liver or kidneys . The CMP can tell your doctor: How your kidneys and liver are working How much protein is in your blood Your electrolyte levels The balance of acid and base in your blood Your blood sugar levels Comprehensive Metabolic Panel Tests Most labs do the same tests, but this may vary slightly depending on the lab or what your doctor has asked them to test. Most CMPs include the following 14 tests: CMP liver and protein tests Albumin. It's made in your liver and is the main protein in your blood and carries hormones, vitamins, and enzymes throughout your body. Low levels may be a sign of liver or kidney disease or another medical condition. High levels may be a sign of dehydration. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP). It's a protein made in your liver, bones, kidneys, and digestive system. Abnormal levels of ALP may be a sign of health conditions, such as liver disease, bone disorders, and chronic kidney disease. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT). It's a protein made mostly in the liver. Damaged liver cells release ALT into your blood. High levels in your blood may be a sign of liver injury or disease. You may have high ALT levels in your blood before you have any symptoms, so an ALT test can give your doctor a way of catching some liver diseases early. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST). This protein is made mostly in your liver, but also in some muscles and other organs. Your doctor may use this test to help diagnose or monitor liver damage or disease. Total protein. It refers to the total amount of protein in your blood, which includes albumin and globulin. Globulins are proteins that help fight infections and carry nutrients in your body. Some globulins are made in the liver and others are made by the immune system. Low total protein levels can be a sign of a serious health problem. Bilirubin. It's a yellow chemical your body makes when it breaks down old red blood cells. Your liver usually filters most of the bilirubin out of your blood. If your liver is damaged, bilirubin can leak out. If you have too much bilirubin in your blood, you may get jaundice, when your skin and eyes turn yellow. This test can help your doctor check on how well your liver is working. CMP kidney tests Blood urea nitrogen (BUN). Urea nitrogen is a waste product that your kidneys filter out of your blood. High BUN levels may be a sign that your kidneys aren't working well. You may have high BUN levels in your blood before you have any symptoms of kidney disease, so this test can give your doctor a way of catching some kidney problems early. This test may also be called a urea nitrogen test or serum BUN. Creatinine. It's a normal breakdown product in your body. Your muscles make it when you work them hard. Your kidneys usually filter creatinine out of your blood. High levels of creatinine may be a sign of kidney disease, dehydration, muscle disorders, body injury, muscular dystrophy, or intense exercise. This test may also be called serum creatinine, kidney function, or renal function. The lab often uses this result to calculate an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and also compares it to your BUN. These calculations can help your doctor figure out if you have a serious kidney problem and possibly why you're having it. CMP electrolyte tests Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a breakdown product your body makes when you digest food. You breathe it out of your lungs when you exhale. Most of the CO2 in your blood is bicarbonate, which is an electrolyte. Electrolytes are electrically charged minerals that help you control the amount of fluid in your body as well as your pH balance (balance of acids and bases). High or low levels can be a sign you have an electrolyte imbalance. Diseases that can cause an electrolyte imbalance include high blood pressure and kidney, lung, or liver conditions. Chloride is a type of electrolyte, and abnormal levels can be a sign you have an electrolyte imbalance. High levels may be a sign of dehydration, kidney disease, or acidosis (having too much acid in your blood). Low levels may be a sign of heart failure, lung disease, Addison disease (a condition where your adrenal glands don't make enough of certain hormones), or alkalosis (having too much base in your blood). You may also have abnormal levels of chloride if you are overhydrated, dehydrated, or if you've taken antacids. Potassium is necessary for your cells, nerves, heart, and muscles to work well. High levels may be a sign of kidney disease, Addison disease, or type 1 diabetes. High levels may also be from injury, burns, surgery, or certain medicines, such as diuretics or antibiotics. Low levels may be a sign of adrenal gland disorders (such as Cushing's syndrome and aldosteronism), kidney disease, or alcohol use disorder. It can also be from diuretics, dehydration, or laxatives. Sodium is necessary for your nerves and muscles to work well. High levels may be a sign of dehydration, adrenal gland disorders, kidney problems, and diabetes insipidus (a disorder of your kidneys or pituitary gland that makes you very thirsty so that you drink and pee a lot). Low levels may be a sign of dehydration, kidney diseases, cirrhosis of the liver, heart failure, Addison disease, some brain and lung diseases, and some types of cancer. It can also be from over-the-counter pain medicine or antidepressants. CMP glucose test Glucose is a type of sugar and your body's main source of energy. High levels may be a sign of diabetes or other disorders of your pancreas, hyperthyroidism, or stress from surgery, trauma, or other serious illnesses. If you have diabetes, low levels may be due to too much diabetes medicine, not eating enough, or exercising more than you usually do. If you don't have diabetes, low levels may be a sign of liver or kidney disease, alcohol use disorder, hypothyroidism, or an underactive adrenal or pituitary gland. CMP calcium test Calcium is one of the most important minerals in your body. You need the right amount of calcium in your blood for your nerves, muscles, and heart to work well. Low levels of calcium may be a sign of bone disease, thyroid disease, parathyroid disorders, kidney disease, or other conditions. Comprehensive Metabolic Panel Procedure A health care professional will use a small needle to take a blood sample from a vein in your arm. They’ll collect the blood in test tubes or vials. You may feel a little sting when they put the needle in or pull it out. The whole process usually takes less than 5 minutes. Afterward, you may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle went in, but most symptoms go away quickly. If you’re in the hospital, the doctor may do daily tests. If you aren’t in the hospital, but you have a condition such as diabetes or kidney disease, you may go to the doctor’s office or a clinic every few months for tests. Who performs a comprehensive metabolic panel? Any health care professional who is trained in drawing blood can perform a CMP, but it's usually done by a phlebotomist. Phlebotomists are health care professionals who specialize in drawing blood from adults and children. They collect and prepare your blood so it can be tested in a medical lab. After they draw your blood, they will send it to a lab, where medical lab scientists prepare the samples and use specialized machines to analyze them. Comprehensive metabolic panel fasting You will usually need to fast (avoid eating or drinking) before your test. If so, it's usually for at least 8-12 hours. This is so that any food you have eaten won't interfere with your glucose levels. Your doctor will usually let you know if you need to fast and how long you should fast before your test. Don't exercise before your test because this can affect your results, especially your ALT and AST levels. Also, be ready to tell your doctor about any medicines (including prescription, over-the-counter, and illegal drugs), herbs, vitamins, and supplements you take. Comprehensive Metabolic Panel Results Reference ranges depend on the lab that analyzes your blood tests because different labs use their own equipment. They also have different ways of analyzing your blood. Your doctor will look at all your test results together to see if there are patterns that suggest a medical condition. They will also consider your health history, any medicines you take, and any other factors that may affect your results. Ask your doctor to help you understand what your results mean. Normal comprehensive metabolic panel results General ranges for normal results are as follows: Albumin: 3.4-5.4 grams/deciliter (34 to 54 grams/liter) ALP: 20-130 units/liter ALT: 4-36 units/liter AST: 8-33 units/liter Total protein: 6.0-8.3 grams/deciliter (60 to 83 grams/liter) Bilirubin: 0.1-1.2 milligrams/deciliter (2 to 21 micromoles/liter) BUN: 6-20 milligrams/deciliter (2.14 to 7.14 millimoles/liter) Creatinine: 0.6-1.3 milligrams/deciliter (53 to 114.9 micromoles/liter) CO2 (carbon dioxide): 23-29 milliequivalents/liter (23 to 29 millimoles/liter) Chloride: 96-106 milliequivalents/liter (96 to 106 millimoles/liter) Potassium: 3.7-5.2 milliequivalents/liter (3.70 to 5.20 millimoles/liter) Sodium: 135-145 milliequivalents/liter (135 to 145 millimoles/liter) Glucose: 70-100 milligrams/deciliters (3.9 to 5.6 millimoles/liter) Calcium: 8.5-10.2 milligrams/deciliter (2.13 to 2.55 millimoles/liter) But always go by the ranges that are on your report because that’s what your doctor will use. Abnormal comprehensive metabolic panel results If any of your results are not what they should be, your doctor might ask you to come back for more tests. This will help your doctor figure out if there’s a true problem. A lot of things can affect your CMP results, such as: Medications you take, such as steroids , insulin , and hormones Eating or drinking before the test Exercising before the test Blood cell damage that may happen while your blood is collected or when the sample is prepared for analysis Ask your doctor about any abnormal results because they can help you understand what your results mean. Takeaways A comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) is a test that measures 14 different chemicals in a sample of your blood. It gives your doctor an idea of how well your liver and kidneys are working, how much protein and electrolytes you have, your acid-base balance, and your blood sugar levels. Many people get a CMP during their routine checkup, but your doctor may also use it to keep track of how well your medicines are working or to check for kidney or liver diseases. You usually need to fast for the test, but your doctor will let you know if you do. Abnormal results don't always mean you have a medical condition because lots of things can affect your results. Ask your doctor to go through your results with you so you can understand what your results mean for your body."
16,What Is Batten Disease?,"Batten disease is a rare group of nervous system disorders called neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCLs) (or ceroid lipofuscinosis, neuronal: CLN) that get worse over time. It usually starts in childhood, between the ages of 5 and 10 (unless the child has the infantile or late infantile form and symptoms then usually develop before the age of 1). There are different forms of the disease but all are fatal, usually by the late teens or twenties (Children with the disease have a shortened life expectancy and the increased risk for early death depends on the form of the disease and the age of onset of the disease). The damage is caused by the buildup of fatty substances, called lipopigments, in the cells of the brain , central nervous system , and retina in the eye . Out of every 100,000 babies born in the United States, it’s estimated that about two to four have this disease that’s passed down through families. Since it’s genetic, it can affect more than one person in the same family. Both parents have to be carriers of the gene in order to pass it down. Each one of their children has a one in four chance of getting it. Symptoms Over time, Batten disease damages the brain and nervous system . There are four main types of this condition. These are their common symptoms: Seizures Changes in personality and behavior Dementia Speech and motor skills problems that get worse over time There are four major types of Batten disease. The type will determine the age when symptoms occur and how fast they develop. There is no cure for these disorders but a treatment for one of the forms (CLN2 disease) has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2017 (See below). The Types Originally, doctors only referred to one form of NCL as Batten disease, but now the name refers to the group of disorders. Of the four major types, the three that affect children all cause blindness. Congenital NCL affects babies and can cause them to be born with seizures and abnormally small heads ( microcephaly ). It’s very rare, and often results in death soon after a baby is born. Infantile NCL (INCL) (CLN1) usually shows up between the ages of 6 months and 2 years, (but usually before age 1). It also can cause microcephaly, as well as sharp contractions (jerks) in the muscles. Most children with INCL die in early to mid-childhood).  (There is also a juvenile onset of CLN1, abnormalities develop around age 5/6 and disease progression is slower.  Affected children may live into their teenage years or even into adulthood if they develop the symptoms in the adolescence period). Late Infantile NCL (LINCL) (CLN2) typically starts between the ages of 2 and 4 with symptoms like seizures and gradually lose the ability to walk and speak.  LINCL is usually fatal by the time a child is 8 to 12 years old. There is no specific treatment that can cure or reverse the symptoms of any form of Batten disease but in 2017 the Food and Drug Administration approved an enzyme replacement therapy for CLN2 disease (TTP1 deficiency) called cerliponase alfa (Brineura). Brineura is a prescription medication used to slow loss of ability to walk or crawl (ambulation) in symptomatic pediatric patients 3 years of age and older with late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 2 (CLN2).  Brineura is administered into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by infusion via a specific surgically implanted reservoir and catheter in the head (intraventricular access device).  There are no treatments that can slow or stop disease progression for other NCL disorders. CLN3 disease: Juvenile onset (ages 4-7). Progressive vision loss begins between 4-7 yrs old.  Learning and behavioral problem occur, there is cognitive decline and patients can start having seizures around age 10.  Seizures may be controlled or reduced with antiseizure medications.  Children in their teenage years develop Parkinsonism like symptoms.  Medicines are available to treat some of the parkinsonism symptoms (stiffness and difficulty with walking/doing tasks), and spasticity (muscle stiffness).   Most die between the age of 15-30. Adult NCL (ANCL) (CLN4 or Kufs disease type B) starts before the age of 40 (early adulthood). These patients have problems with movement and early dementia.   People who have it have shorter life spans, but the age of death can vary from person to person. The symptoms of ANCL are milder and they tend to progress more slowly. This form of the disease does not result in blindness. Diagnosis and Tests Batten disease is often misdiagnosed, because it’s rare and many conditions share some of the same symptoms. Since vision loss is usually one of the earliest signs of the disease, eye doctors can be the first ones to suspect a problem. Multiple exams and tests might be needed before your doctor makes a diagnosis. Doctors often refer children to neurologists if they think they need more tests. There are different kinds of tests a neurologist can use to diagnose Batten disease: Tissue samples or eye exam : By examining tissue samples under a microscope, doctors can look for the buildup of certain kinds of deposits. Sometimes doctors can see these deposits just by looking into a child’s eyes . As the deposits build up over time, they can cause pink and orange circles to develop. This is called a “bull’s eye .” Blood or urine tests : Doctors can look for certain kinds of abnormalities in blood and urine samples that can indicate Batten disease. Electroencephalogram (EEG): This is a test that involves putting patches on the scalp to record the brain ’s electrical currents and look for seizures. Imaging tests : CT (computed tomography) scans or MRIs ( magnetic resonance imaging ) can help a doctor see if there are certain changes in the brain that indicate Batten disease. DNA test : If you know members of your family have Batten disease, you can get a DNA test to confirm a diagnosis. Treatment There’s currently no known cure for any form of Batten disease, but the FDA approved an enzyme replacement therapy for CLN2 disease (TTP1 deficiency) called cerliponase alfa (Brineura) for one of the forms (CLN2 disease) in 2017. Symptoms like seizures can be improved with certain medications. Other symptoms and issues can be treated, too, with therapy and medications. Some people with Batten disease get physical or occupational therapy to help them function. Scientists continue to research possible treatments and therapies."
17,B-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia for Adults,"What Is B-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia? B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia is a cancer that affects your ""B lymphocytes"" -- white blood cells that grow in the soft center of your bones, called marrow. B lymphocytes are supposed to grow into cells that help you fight infections. But in this disease, they turn into "" leukemia "" cells that live longer than normal cells and reproduce quickly. They build up in your bone marrow and move into your bloodstream. From there they can spread to other organs in your body. Although in most cases it can't be cured, treatment can help you live longer and better. And researchers are looking for new treatments to fight the disease. Remember, you have control over the decisions you make about your treatment and your life. Make sure you reach out to family and friends so you can talk to them about your plans, your fears, and your feelings. Ask your doctor about support groups, where you can meet people who understand what you're going through. Causes In most cases, doctors don't know what causes B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-cell ALL). It doesn't appear to run in families. Some things may increase your chances of getting it: for instance, if you've had chemotherapy or radiation treatment for cancer in the past. Also, getting chemotherapy and radiation together can raise your risk even more. Symptoms Your symptoms depend on the number of leukemia cells you have. Treatments that kill your leukemia cells also get rid of the symptoms. When you first get B-cell ALL, you may feel tired and get a fever. You also might lose your appetite and get night sweats . If the leukemia cells in your bone marrow crowd out cells that are in charge of making blood, you won't have enough normal blood cells . When this happens, you may start feeling weak, dizzy, or light-headed. You may also get symptoms such as: Shortness of breath Repeated infections Bruise easily Frequent bleeding, such as nosebleeds or from your gums Some symptoms depend on where in your body the leukemia cells move. For instance, if they travel to your liver and spleen , they may cause these organs to get bigger. Your belly may swell. You might feel full after you eat only a little bit of food. You may feel pain in your joints or bones if the leukemia cells have spread there. If the cancer cells have moved into the lymph nodes of your neck, underarms, or groin, you may see swelling in those areas. It's not as common, but sometimes the leukemia cells move to the brain and cause headaches or trouble with balance. Leukemia cells that get into your chest may lead to breathing problems . Getting a Diagnosis Your doctor will do a physical exam and ask you questions about your medical history. They  may ask you: Do you feel extremely tired? Have you ever felt dizzy or weak? Do you have bruises ? Have you been sick a lot recently? Do you get a lot of nosebleeds or do your gums bleed? Your doctor may also want you to take some blood tests that can give clues about whether you have B-cell ALL: Complete blood count (CBC). It checks the number of blood cells in your body, including white blood cells. Peripheral blood smear. It looks for changes in the number of blood cells and how they look. The results of these tests can reveal signs that you may have B-cell ALL, such as too many young white blood cells or too few of the two other types of blood cells -- red blood cells and platelets. You may also need to get a bone marrow test. Your doctor will take samples of your bone marrow, usually from the back of your hip bone. For this test, you lie down on a table and get a shot that will numb the area. Then your doctor uses a needle to remove a small amount of liquid bone marrow. Your doctor will look at the sample under a microscope. They will check the size and shape of the white blood cells. Cells that look like they haven't developed fully could be signs that you have B-cell ALL. Once B-cell ALL has been diagnosed, your doctor may want to do tests to see if it has spread to other parts of your body. These might include an X-ray or a CT scan. An X-ray uses radiation in low doses to make images of your body's structures. A CT scan is a series of X-rays from different angles that makes detailed images of what is inside your body. You may also get a test called a spinal tap (lumbar puncture). It checks to see if cancer cells have spread to the brain and spinal cord. For this test, your doctor gives you a shot to numb your lower back. Then they put a needle in the area around your spinal cord to remove some fluid called CSF (cerebrospinal fluid). Questions for Your Doctor There's a lot to take in when your doctor gives you a diagnosis of B-cell ALL. Some questions you can ask your doctor include: What kind of treatment do you recommend? Are there side effects? How will you check on my progress? Are there clinical trials of new treatments that I should consider joining? Treatment The word ""acute"" in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia means the disease spreads quickly, so it's important to get early treatment. You have different choices for treatment. In general, your treatment will have three phases. The goal of the first phase is ""total remission"" -- to kill the leukemia cells and get rid of all your symptoms. Your doctor may call it the induction phase. If you go into remission, the next stage is to kill any leftover leukemia cells that aren't active but could grow later, causing the disease to return. Your doctor may call this phase of treatment the consolidation phase or ""post-remission therapy."" The third phase is generally called maintenance therapy and the goal is to prevent the cancer cells from coming back. Talk with your doctor about the best type of treatment for you. And remember, you don't have to face things alone. Talk to family and friends who can give you emotional support. Your treatment options include: Chemotherapy. In this treatment, you take drugs that move through your bloodstream and kill cancer cells throughout your body. You might get these drugs in three phases over about 2 years. While you're getting chemo, you may feel nauseous, but certain medicines can reduce vomiting . Chemotherapy with stem cell transplant. Some people with B-cell ALL may need large doses of chemotherapy. But doctors hesitate to give large amounts, because it can damage your bone marrow. That's where a stem cell transplant can help. After your high-dose chemo, you'll get a transplant of stem cells that can help get your bone marrow working right again. The stem cells in a transplant live in your bone marrow and help make new blood cells. When you get this transplant, a donor will supply the new stem cells. You'll need to get on a waiting list to find a donor who is the right match for you, so your body doesn't ""reject"" the new cells. Close relatives, such as a brother or sister, are the best chance for a good match. If that doesn't work out, you need to get on a list of potential donors from strangers. Sometimes the best chance for the right stem cells for you will be from someone who is the same race or ethnicity as you. Before the transplant, you'll likely need to get treated with high doses of chemo for about a week or two. This can be a tough process, because you may get side effects like nausea and mouth sores. When the high-dose chemo is done, you'll start the transplant. The new stem cells are given to you through an IV. You won't feel any pain from this, and you're awake while it’s happening. After your transplant, it could take 2 to 6 weeks for the stem cells to multiply and start making new blood cells. During this time you may be in the hospital, or at the very least, will need to make visits every day to get checked by your transplant team. It can take 6 months to a year until the number of normal blood cells in your body gets back to what it should be. Targeted therapy. This treatment uses drugs that go after specific parts of cancer cells. You often get the drugs in this type of therapy every day in pill form. They usually have fewer severe side effects than chemotherapy. This treatment doesn't work for everyone, but it puts a lot of people into remission and may help keep the cancer from coming back. CAR T-cell therapy. It's a type of gene therapy that the FDA has approved for children and  adults whose B-cell ALL doesn't get better with other treatments. CAR T-cell therapy uses some of your own immune cells, known as T cells, to treat your cancer. Doctors take the cells out of your blood and change them by adding new genes. The new T-cells can work better to find and kill cancer cells. Taking Care of Yourself While you're getting treatment, you can do a lot of things to manage side effects and stay healthy. Since chemotherapy can sometimes upset your stomach , you can try changing some of your eating habits. For instance, stay away from fried or spicy foods. You can also try eating five or six small meals a day rather than the traditional three meals. If your treatment makes you tired, try to take short naps. You also might find that short walks can help boost your energy. If you're stressed about your treatment, sometimes deep breathing or meditation can help you relax. Reach out to family and friends who can give you emotional support when you need it. What to Expect It's likely that your treatment for B-cell ALL will take a number of years. After your treatment is over, you'll have regular visits to your doctor so they can check to make sure your cancer hasn't returned. Your doctor will also check for any lingering side effects of your therapy. For some people, treatment makes the cancer go away. For others, the cancer may not go away completely, or it may return. If that's the case, you may need regular treatment with chemotherapy or other drugs to keep it in check for as long as possible. It's possible that treatment to fight B-cell ALL may stop working. If that happens, you may want to focus on making sure you're as comfortable as possible, known as palliative care. You may not be able to control your cancer, but you can control choices about how you'll live your life. You don't have to face things alone. Consider joining a support group, where you can share your feelings with others who understand what it's like. Getting Support You can get more information about B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and learn how to join support groups, on the web site of the American Cancer Society ."
18,Behcet’s Syndrome,"What Is Behcet’s Syndrome? Behcet’s syndrome (also called Behcet’s disease) is rare condition that causes your body’s blood vessels to swell. This can cause symptoms throughout your body. Sores inside your mouth and on your genitals are common, but you may also have symptoms in other areas. There’s no cure for Behcet’s syndrome, but there are ways to treat the symptoms. Behcet’s Syndrome Signs and Symptoms Behcet’s syndrome is different for everyone. Some people have only mild symptoms. Others have more serious problems. Your symptoms often come and go. Bouts of symptoms are called flares. Going long periods without symptoms is called remission. Most people with Behcet’s syndrome have sores in the mouth and on the genitals. But the swelling of blood vessels it causes can bring on symptoms throughout your body: Mouth: Sores on the lips, tongue , and inside of the cheek Mouth pain Eyes : Swelling in the front or back of the eye , called uveitis Blurry vision Sensitivity to light Tearing Redness Pain Vision loss Genitals: Sores on the scrotum in men Sores on the vulva in women Skin : Bumps that look like acne Red lumps on the legs and ankles Joints: Pain in the knees, ankles, wrists, and elbows Joint swelling Brain and spinal cord: Fever Headache Stiff neck Confusion Personality changes Memory loss Trouble speaking Digestive system : Stomach pain Diarrhea Bleeding from sores in the stomach and intestines Sometimes, Behcet’s affects other organs, like the kidneys and lungs . Behcet’s Syndrome Causes and Risk Factors Doctors aren’t sure what causes Behcet’s syndrome. They believe it starts when the immune system mistakenly attacks the blood vessels. You’re more likely to get it if you have a problem with your immune system. Some people inherit genes that cause their immune system to attack the blood vessels. Doctors believe an infection or something else in the environment triggers the condition in those who have the gene. Risk factors Some things can make you more likely to have Behcet’s syndrome, including: Age: Although you can get it at any age, it usually shows up when you’re in your 20s or 30s. Genes: Certain genes (a portion of your DNA) are linked to this condition. Sex: Although anyone can get it, it affects more men, more severely, than women. Where you live: Behcet’s syndrome is very rare in the U.S. It’s more common in the Middle East and Asia. Behcet’s Syndrome Diagnosis Because there are so many different symptoms, Behcet’s syndrome can be hard to diagnose. It has symptoms similar to many other conditions, including Crohn’s disease, lupus , and arthritis . Your doctor may want to give you a blood test to rule out other conditions. It can take months to find out for sure that you have Behcet’s. Doctors will look at your medical history, do a physical exam , and look for groups of symptoms. You may be diagnosed with Behcet’s if you have mouth sores at least three times in a year, and you have at least two of these symptoms: Sores on your genitals Swelling in your eyes , along with vision loss Skin sores Positive pathergy test: Your doctor will prick your arm with a small needle. If a bump forms in that spot 1 or 2 days later, it’s a good clue that you may have the condition. It indicates an overreaction by your immune system to a small injury. Doctors who treat Behcet’s Which doctors you see will depend on your symptoms: Eye swelling: Ophthalmologist Skin sores or mouth ulcers: Dermatologist Sore joints: Rheumatologist Genital sores: Urologist Sores in the stomach or intestines : Gastroenterologist Blood problems: Hematologist Brain and nervous system problems: Neurologist Because you may have many symptoms, you may need to visit several of these doctors. Behcet’s Syndrome Treatment Your treatments will be based on your symptoms. Corticosteroids can calm the immune system and bring down swelling in your body. Other medicines that work to help your immune system response can also be prescribed, such as adalimumab ( Humira ), azathioprine ( Imuran ), cyclophosphamide , cyclosporine ( Neoral , Sandimmune ), and infliximab ( Remicade ). Creams or ointments can ease skin and genital sores. Your doctor may recommend nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs , or NSAIDs , and colchicine for joint pain and swelling. Steroid eye drops can bring down eye swelling. Behcet’s Syndrome Complications Depending on your symptoms, it’s possible you could get complications from Behcet’s syndrome. But not everyone will. It’s important to see your doctor if you are noticing new symptoms. For example, if you have eye inflammation that goes untreated, it can result in loss of vision . Treatment can help prevent this. Blood clots can also cause serious complications. A pulmonary artery aneurism (when there’s a bulge in your artery that can burst) is rare but can be fatal. Inflammation in your brain or spinal cord can also cause disability. Always call your doctor if you have questions or new symptoms. Behcet’s Syndrome Outlook You can live an active life with Behcet’s. Your symptoms might get better as you grow older. There may be periods of time when all symptoms disappear. For some, the symptoms get worse over time. Medicines help control these symptoms and prevent flares."
19,Neurofibromatosis,"What Is Neurofibromatosis? Neurofibromatosis is a genetic disorder of the nervous system . Tumors form on your nerve tissues. Mainly, neurofibromatosis disorders affect the growth and development of nerve cell tissue. The disorders are known as neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2). NF1 is the more common type of neurofibromatosis. Schwannomatosis has recently been identified as a third and more rare type of neurofibromatosis, but doctors don’t know much about it yet. You may also hear NF1 called Recklinghausen disease, von Recklinghausen disease, von Recklinghausen’s phakomatosis, von Recklinghausen’s neurofibromatosis, neurofibroma (multiple), neurofibromatosis- pheochromocytoma -duodenal carcinoid syndrome , or peripheral neurofibromatosis. It causes multiple café au lait spots (patches of tan or light brown skin) and neurofibromas (soft, fleshy growths) on or under your skin . It can also cause enlarged or deformed bones and curvature of the spine ( scoliosis ). Occasionally, tumors may develop in the brain, on cranial nerves, or on the spinal cord. About 50% to 75% of people with NF1 also have learning disabilities . Neurofibromatosis, neurofibromas. Neurofibromatosis is a genetic disorder of the nervous system which causes tumors to form on your nerve tissues. It causes multiple patches of tan or light brown skin and soft, fleshy growths known as neurofibromas to grow on or under your skin. NF2 is also called bilateral acoustic neurofibromatosis, vestibular schwannoma neurofibromatosis, or central neurofibromatosis. It’s much less common than NF1 and is characterized by multiple tumors on the cranial and spinal nerves. Tumors that affect both of the auditory nerves and hearing loss beginning in the teens or early 20s are generally the first symptoms of NF2. Neurofibromatosis Symptoms Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) symptoms The following symptoms appear in people with NF1: Neurofibromatosis. Also called Recklinghausen’s disease, neurofibromatosis is characterized by areas of pigmentation like this café au lait spot on a 16-year-old. NF1 is a genetic disorder of the nervous system causing neurofibromas (tumors) to grow on the fibrous covering of nerves. Spots like this one can appear on the skin and can sometimes be accompanied by physical deformation. Most are benign but they can become malignant and those with NF1 have a predisposition to brain tumors and various forms of cancer. People with this disorder should seek genetic counseling before planning a child. Dermatologists look for more than six cafe au lait macules greater than 5mm in greatest diameter in pre-pubescent kids and greater than 15 mm in postpubertal people to initiate a workup for Neurofibromatosis 1. Several (usually 6 or more) café au lait spots Multiple freckles in the armpit or groin area Tiny growths in the iris (colored area) of the eye ; these are called Lisch nodules and usually do not affect eyesight . Neurofibromas that occur on or under the skin, sometimes even deep within the body. These are benign (harmless) tumors. But in rare cases, they can turn malignant or cancerous. Bone deformities, including a twisted spine (scoliosis) or bowed legs Tumors along the optic nerve, which may cause eyesight problems Nerve-related pain High blood pressure Osteoporosis Learning disabilities Large head size Short stature Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) symptoms People with NF2 often display the following symptoms: Loss of hearing Weakness of the muscles of the face Dizziness Poor balance Uncoordinated walking Cataracts (cloudy areas on the lens of the eye ) that develop at an unusually early age Headaches Schwannomatosis symptoms People with schwannomatosis may have the following symptoms: Pain from the enlarging tumors Numbness and tingling of the fingers or toes Weakness in the fingers and toes Chronic pain Loss of muscle Neurofibromatosis Causes Neurofibromatosis: Crowe's Sign is freckling in the armpit of those with neurofibromatosis type I (von Recklinghausen's disease). Neurofibromatosis is a genetic disorder of the nervous system which affect the growth and development of nerve cell tissue. These freckles occur in up to 30% of people with the disease and their presence is one of six diagnostic criteria for neurofibromatosis. Freckles can also appear in the groin area, along the jaw and in the nape of the neck. Neurofibromatosis is often inherited (passed on by family members through your genes). But about 50% of people newly diagnosed with the disorder have no family history of the condition. That’s because it can result from a sudden mutation (change) in your genes. Once this change takes place, you can pass the mutant gene on to future generations. Mutations that lead to neurofibromatosis include: Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1): The NF1 gene on chromosome 17 makes a protein called neurofibromin that controls your cells’ growth. The mutation of this gene causes a neurofibromin loss and uncontrolled cell growth. Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2): The NF2 gene on chromosome 22 makes a protein called merlin or schwannomin. It suppresses tumors. Changes to this gene cause a loss of merlin and uncontrolled cell growth. Schwannomatosis: Mutations of the two known genes linked to schwannomatosis, SMARCB1 and LZTR1, which both suppress tumors, are associated with this type of neurofibromatosis. Neurofibromatosis Diagnosis Neurofibromatosis is diagnosed using a number of tests, including: Physical examination Medical history Family history X-rays Computerized tomography (CT) scans Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) Biopsy of neurofibromas Eye tests Tests for particular symptoms, such as hearing or balance tests Genetic testing To receive a diagnosis of NF1, you must have two of the following features: Six or more café au lait spots that are 1.5 centimeters or larger in people who have had puberty, or 0.5 centimeters or larger in people who haven’t Two or more neurofibromas (tumors that develop from the cells and tissues that cover nerves) of any type, or one or more plexiform neurofibroma (a nerve that has become thick and misshapen due to the abnormal growth of cells and tissues that cover the nerve) Freckling in the armpit or groin Optic glioma (tumor of the optic pathway) Two or more Lisch nodules A distinctive bony lesion, dysplasia of the sphenoid bone, or dysplasia or thinning of long bone cortex A first-degree relative with NF1 To be diagnosed with NF2, you must have: Bilateral (on both sides) vestibular schwannomas, also known as acoustic neuromas. These are benign tumors that develop from the balance and hearing nerves supplying the inner ear . or Family history of NF2 (first-degree family relative) plus unilateral (on one side) or bilateral vestibular schwannomas, or any two of the following health conditions: Multiple meningiomas (tumors that occur in the meninges, the membranes that cover and protect the brain and spinal cord) Glioma ( cancer of the brain that begins in glial cells, which are those that surround and support nerve cells) Any neurofibromas Schwannoma Juvenile cataracts Gradual hearing loss Ringing in the ears Balance problems Headaches Schwannomatosis diagnosis is based on these criteria: If you’re 30 or older, you have no evidence of vestibular tumors on an MRI scan, no known NF2 gene mutation, and two or more schwannomas within or between skin layers, one being confirmed by a biopsy. You have one schwannoma confirmed by biopsy and a first-degree relative who also meets the criteria. If you have a type called segmental schwannomatosis, you have tumors limited to one area of the body, such as your arm, leg, or spine. Neurofibromatosis Treatment There’s no cure for neurofibromatosis. Treatments focus on controlling symptoms. There’s no standard treatment for NF, and many symptoms, such as café au lait spots, do not need treatment. When treatment is necessary, options may include: Surgery to remove problem growths or tumors Treatment that includes chemotherapy or radiation if a tumor has turned malignant, or cancerous Surgery for bone problems, like scoliosis Therapy (including physical therapy , counseling , or support groups) Cataract removal surgery Aggressive treatment of pain linked to the condition Stereotactic radiosurgery Auditory brainstem and cochlear implants Neurofibromatosis Complications Neurofibromatosis complications may vary from person to person. They typically stem from a growing tumor pressing against your nerve tissue or an internal organ. Possible NF1 complications include: Neurological problems like trouble learning or thinking Anxiety or distress with changes to your appearance, like large numbers of cafe au lait spots Skeletal problems, like bowing of the legs, scoliosis, fractures that don’t heal, or low bone density that increases your risk of osteoporosis Vision problems due to a tumor pressing against the optic nerve Problems during times of hormonal changes, such as puberty or pregnancy Cardiovascular problems like high blood pressure Breathing problems Higher risk of some cancers, such as breast cancer , leukemia , colorectal cancer, brain tumors , and some soft tissue cancers Benign adrenal gland tumor that could cause high blood pressure Possible NF2 complications include: Partial hearing loss or deafness Nerve damage in the face Benign skin tumors or schwannomas Vision problems Weakness or numbness in your extremities Benign brain or spine tumors that need to be removed with surgery One possible schwannomatosis complication is severe pain that requires specialist medical treatment or even surgery. Neurofibromatosis Outlook Your outlook depends on the type of NF you have. Often, the symptoms of NF1 are mild, and people who have it are able to lead full and productive lives. Sometimes, pain and deformity can lead to significant disability. The NF2 outlook depends on your age at the start of the disease and on the number and location of tumors. Some can be life-threatening."
20,Acoustic Neuroma,"An acoustic neuroma is a noncancerous growth that develops on the eighth cranial nerve. Also known as the vestibulocochlear nerve, it connects the inner ear with the brain and has two different parts. One part is involved in transmitting sound; the other helps send balance information from the inner ear to the brain . Acoustic neuromas -- sometimes called vestibular schwannomas or neurilemmoma -- usually grow slowly over a period of years. Although they do not actually invade the brain , they can push on it as they grow. Larger tumors can press on nearby cranial nerves that control the muscles of facial expression and sensation. If tumors become large enough to press on the brain stem or cerebellum, they can be deadly. Acoustic Neuroma Symptoms The early symptoms of an acoustic neuroma are often subtle. Many people attribute the symptoms to normal changes of aging, so it may be a while before the condition is diagnosed. The first symptom is usually a gradual loss of hearing in one ear, often accompanied by ringing in the ear (tinnitus) or a feeling of fullness in the ear. Less commonly, acoustic neuromas may cause sudden hearing loss . Other symptoms, which may occur over time, include: Problems with balance Vertigo (feeling like the world is spinning) Facial numbness and tingling, which may be constant or come and go Facial weakness Taste changes Difficulty swallowing and hoarseness Headaches Clumsiness or unsteadiness Confusion It's important to see your doctor if you experience these symptoms. Symptoms like clumsiness and mental confusion can signal a serious problem that requires urgent treatment. Acoustic Neuroma Causes There are two types of acoustic neuroma: a sporadic form and a form associated with a syndrome called neurofibromatosis type II (NF2). NF2 is an inherited disorder characterized by the growth of noncancerous tumors in the nervous system. Acoustic neuromas are the most common of these tumors and often occur in both ears by age 30. NF2 is a rare disorder. It accounts for only 5% of acoustic neuromas. This means the vast majority are the sporadic form. Doctors aren't certain what causes the sporadic form. One known risk factor for acoustic neuroma is exposure to high doses of radiation , especially to the head and neck. Acoustic Neuroma Treatments There are three main courses of treatment for acoustic neuroma: Observation Surgery Radiation therapy Observation is also called watchful waiting. Because acoustic neuromas are not cancerous and grow slowly, immediate treatment may not be necessary. Often doctors monitor the tumor with periodic MRI scans and will suggest other treatment if the tumor grows a lot or causes serious symptoms. Surgery for acoustic neuromas may involve removing all or part of the tumor. There are three main surgical approaches for removing an acoustic neuroma: Translabyrinthine, which involves making an incision behind the ear and removing the bone behind the ear and some of the middle ear. This procedure is used for tumors larger than 3 centimeters. The upside of this approach is that it allows the surgeon to see an important cranial nerve (the facial nerve) clearly before removing the tumor. The downside of this technique is that it results in permanent hearing loss . Retrosigmoid/sub-occipital, which involves exposing the back of the tumor by opening the skull near the back of the head. This approach can be used for removing tumors of any size and offers the possibility of preserving hearing. Middle fossa, which involves removing a small piece of bone above the ear canal to access and remove small tumors confined to the internal auditory canal, the narrow passageway from the brain to the middle and inner ear. Using this approach may enable surgeons to preserve a patient's hearing. Radiation therapy is recommended in some cases for acoustic neuromas. State-of-the-art delivery techniques make it possible to send high doses of radiation to the tumor while limiting expose and damage to surrounding tissue. Radiation therapy for this condition is usually delivered in one of two ways: Single fraction stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), in which many hundreds of small beams of radiation are aimed at the tumor in a single session. Multi-session fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (FRS), which delivers smaller doses of radiation daily, generally over several weeks. Early studies suggest multi-session therapy may preserve hearing better than SRS. Both of these are outpatient procedures, which means they don't require a hospital stay. They work by causing tumor cells to die. The tumor's growth may slow or stop or it may even shrink, but radiation doesn't completely remove the tumor. Other types of radiation therapy have also been used. Your doctor will explain your options to you. Selecting the right treatment depends on a number of factors, including: Size of the tumor Whether the tumor is growing Your age Other medical conditions you may have Severity of your symptoms and their impact on your life"
21,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS),"What Is PCOS? Polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS) is a hormonal condition that affects your ovaries, the female reproductive organs that make eggs. It affects about 1 in every 10 women (and people assigned female at birth) who are of childbearing age. It's one of the most common causes of infertility. It can: Stop your periods or make them hard to predict Cause acne and unwanted body and facial hair Raise your risk for other health problems, including diabetes and high blood pressure Some people with PCOS have cysts (small sacs of fluid) on their ovaries. That’s why it’s called “polycystic.” But the name is a bit misleading because many people with the condition don’t have cysts. In fact, many don’t have symptoms at all. That's one reason why up to 70% of those with PCOS don’t know they have it. Polycystic ovaries are those that have lots of immature egg sac cysts (follicles). Not everyone with PCOS has ovarian cysts. (Photo credit: iStock/Getty Images) The condition starts after puberty, but may not be diagnosed until you’re trying to get pregnant. It never goes away, but symptoms usually get better after menopause. In the meantime, several treatments can relieve the symptoms or help you get pregnant. PCOS vs. PCOD Polycystic ovary disease (PCOD) is another, older name for PCOS. PCOS has also been called Stein-Leventhal syndrome. Endometriosis vs. PCOS When you have endometriosis, the type of tissue that lines your uterus grows in places it shouldn't, such as your vagina or ovaries. Each month, this tissue can break down and bleed. Like PCOS, endometriosis can cause cysts in your ovaries and may lead to infertility. Its main symptoms are cramps and pain in the belly area. Unlike PCOS, it doesn't cause symptoms such as acne or excess body hair. Types of PCOS Some scientists propose dividing PCOS into types based on symptoms and hormone levels: Non-hyperandrogenic PCOS, or type D: You have problems with ovulation (which can lead to irregular periods or loss of periods) and cysts on your ovaries. But your levels of androgens (male hormones) are normal. Ovulatory PCOS (type C): You have increased levels of androgens along with cysts on your ovaries. Non-PCO PCOS (type B): You have high levels of androgens as well as problems with ovulation. Full-blown PCOS (type A): You have high levels of androgens, problems with ovulation, as well as cysts on your ovaries. Informally, you might hear people describe it using other terms that refer to its causes or symptoms: Insulin-resistant PCOS. Often, those who have PCOS also have insulin resistance, which is when your body makes the hormone insulin but can't use it correctly. Insulin resistance increases your risk for type 2 diabetes. Inflammatory PCOS. Inflammation results when your immune system tries to fight off a threat. Research has linked PCOS to low levels of inflammation throughout the body. This could cause or worsen symptoms. Conditions such as insulin resistance and obesity contribute to inflammation. Hidden-cause PCOS. Some websites use this term to refer to PCOS for which the cause isn't known. But this is true of PCOS in general. Scientists don't know what causes the condition, though they believe that both your genes and environmental factors play a role. Pill-induced PCOS or post-pill PCOS. The pill and other hormonal birth control methods don't cause PCOS. But when you stop using this type of birth control, you could temporarily have irregular periods or other symptoms that look like those of PCOS. Hormonal birth control can also mask the symptoms of PCOS. So you might not be diagnosed with it until you go off birth control. Doctors sometimes prescribe hormonal birth control to treat PCOS symptoms. PCOS and Hormones Your body makes many types of hormones. Hormones are chemical messengers that help control many body functions. Some affect your menstrual cycle and are tied to your ability to have a baby. When you have PCOS, your reproductive hormones are out of balance. Several hormones play a role in PCOS. PCOS insulin resistance Insulin is a hormone that manages your blood sugar levels. Scientists estimate that 30%-80% of those with PCOS have insulin resistance. When your body doesn't react to insulin as it should, you can end up with too much insulin in your body. Some researchers think this excess insulin plays a role in causing your body to overproduce androgens. Other hormones involved in the syndrome include: Androgens. They’re often called male hormones, but everyone has them. When you have PCOS, your ovaries make more androgens than usual. This can keep your ovaries from releasing eggs on their monthly schedule and cause irregular periods. Extra androgens are responsible for many PCOS symptoms, including acne, hair loss, and unwanted hair growth. Follicle-stimulating hormone. This hormone helps prepare your body for ovulation and helps control your menstrual cycle. Luteinizing hormone. This also helps regulate your monthly cycle, triggering your ovaries to release eggs . Progesterone. With PCOS, your body may not have enough of this hormone. So you might miss periods for a long time or have trouble predicting when they’ll come. Estrogen. When you have PCOS, your levels of estrogen may be too high in relation to your progesterone levels. PCOS Symptoms What are the first signs of PCOS? Polycystic ovary syndrome isn't actually a disease but a set of symptoms. These symptoms can vary from person to person. But the most common signs of PCOS are missed, irregular, infrequent, or too-long periods. Other possible signs of PCOS include: Hair loss . PCOS can cause the hair on your head to get thinner, especially if you're middle-aged or older . Excess face and body h air (hirsutism). At the same time, hair may grow in places you don’t want it, like your face, chest, belly, arms, fingers, and toes. Oily skin. Extra androgens can lead to oilier skin. Acne. You might have breakouts on your face, chest, and/or back. Darkened skin. Patches of skin that look darker than the surrounding area can show up under your breasts or arms, or on your neck. Skin tags. These little flaps of excess skin most often appear on your neck or armpits. PCOS pain. You may have pain in your lower-belly (pelvic) area during your period and occasionally at other times. Weight gain (PCOS belly) . About 50% of those with PCOS have weight gain, especially in the abdominal (belly) area. Ovarian cysts. When you have an ultrasound, your doctor might notice that your ovaries look bigger or have lots of egg sac cysts (follicles). Mood changes. PCOS raises your risk of mood swings and feelings of depression or anxiety. This can be caused by hormonal changes as well as the strain of dealing with PCOS symptoms. Can you have PCOS without symptoms? Sometimes, PCOS doesn't cause any symptoms, or they're so minor that you don't notice them. For that reason, and because many other issues can cause similar period problems, it may take a while to get a PCOS diagnosis. PCOS Causes Doctors don’t know exactly what causes the syndrome. But things that are thought to be involved include: Excess weight. The link between weight and PCOS is complicated. Weight gain plays a role in the development of the condition. But PCOS can also contribute to weight gain. High levels of androgens. This condition, called hyperandrogenism, affects most people with PCOS. Insulin resistance . Extra insulin can affect your ovaries and their ability to release eggs (ovulate). It can also make it easier to gain weight and harder to lose it. Long-term, low-grade inflammation . This also contributes to your body's overproduction of androgens. Is PCOS genetic? The genetic link to PCOS isn't clear, but you're more likely to get it if your close relatives also have it. Some 20%-40% of those with PCOS have a mother or sister with the condition. This may be related to similar lifestyles as well as to genes. PCOS Risk Factors Risk factors for PCOS include: A family history of menstrual problems or disorders (including PCOS) Type 2 diabetes Being overweight or obese Fast weight gain Transgender men (also known as female-to-male transsexual people, or FTMs) are prone to PCOS. Hormone therapy may or may not be a reason for that, as so many other factors come into play. Some studies have shown that while hormone therapy can cause changes to the ovaries of transgender men, it doesn’t necessarily cause PCOS. What Are the Complications of PCOS? When you have PCOS, you have higher odds of having several other health problems, such as: Trouble getting pregnant. Hormonal imbalances can interfere with ovulation . If no healthy egg is available to be fertilized by a sperm , you can’t get pregnant . However, you may still be able to get pregnant despite having PCOS. For that, you might need to take medicine and work with a fertility specialist. Pregnancy complications. Most people with PCOS can have a healthy pregnancy. But the condition raises your risk for diabetes (gestational diabetes) and high blood pressure (preeclampsia) during pregnancy. It also increases the risk of preterm delivery, a cesarean section delivery, and miscarriage. Insulin issues and diabetes. When you have insulin resistance, the cells in your muscles, organs, and other tissues don’t absorb blood sugar very well. So you end up with excess sugar in your bloodstream. Insulin resistance doesn't usually cause symptoms until blood sugar levels get so high that you have diabetes. More than half of those with PCOS will get type 2 diabetes by the time they're 40. Metabolic syndrome. This group of symptoms raises your risk of cardiovascular disease. The symptoms include high triglyceride and low HDL (“good”) cholesterol levels , high blood pressure , and high blood sugar levels . Other possible complications include: Depression Anxiety Bleeding from the uterus and a higher risk of uterine and endometrial cancers Sleep problems, including sleep apnea Inflammation of the liver PCOS Diagnosis You may be diagnosed with PCOS if you have at least two of these symptoms: Periods that aren't regular Signs your body is making extra androgens, such as acne, excess facial and body hair, or a blood test that shows high androgen levels Ovarian cysts or enlarged ovaries that show up on an ultrasound How to get tested for PCOS No single test can diagnose PCOS. Your doctor will start by asking about your symptoms and medical history. They'll do a physical exam to look for symptoms such as acne and facial and body hair. They may also do a pelvic exam. For this test, they place a gloved hand inside your vagina, then feel your reproductive organs to see if your ovaries are enlarged or if there are other abnormalities. They may also do an ultrasound, an imaging test that shows them whether you have cysts and measures the lining of your uterus. For a transvaginal ultrasound, your doctor places a wand in your vagina that uses sound waves to create images of your reproductive organs. You might also have a blood test to check your levels of androgens and other hormones. Other tests you might get If your doctor thinks you have PCOS, they may want you to get checked for other health conditions that aren't linked to PCOS. This might involve: Blood pressure testing Blood tests for sugar, cholesterol, and triglyceride levels Mental health screening Screening for sleep apnea PCOS Treatment There's no cure for PCOS. The medical treatment that your doctor recommends to manage your symptoms depends on whether you're trying to get pregnant. It's important to talk to your doctor about this because certain medications can harm a developing baby. They might prescribe: Hormonal birth control. If you aren’t planning to get pregnant, your doctor might prescribe hormonal birth control, such as the patch, pill, shot, or hormonal IUD. They might contain estrogen, progesterone, or both. They can get your periods on track, help with acne and extra body hair, and lower your risk of endometrial cancer. Progestin therapy. This hormone can help normalize your menstrual cycle and reduce your odds of uterine cancer. It doesn't prevent pregnancy or reduce levels of androgens. Insulin-sensitizing medications . Metformin, a drug used to treat type 2 diabetes, helps lower insulin and androgen levels. While it's not FDA-approved to treat PCOS, it can help with ovulation and period problems. Androgen blockers . These drugs block the effects of the extra male hormones that cause issues such as unwanted hair growth and acne. But don't take them if you're pregnant or plan to get pregnant, because they can cause birth defects. While you're on them, you should use two different types of birth control. Acne medications If you have acne that bothers you, a dermatologist can prescribe creams and/or pills to treat and prevent breakouts. Excessive hair growth If you want to reduce facial or body hair, other options include: Electrolysis or laser therapy : Electrolysis removes individual hairs with an electric current that destroys the root. Laser therapy destroys hair follicles. You'll need several sessions. While some hair may come back, it should be finer and less noticeable. Depilatories : These over-the-counter creams, gels, and lotions break down the protein structure of hair so it falls out of the skin. Follow the directions on the package. PCOS and Pregnancy Getting pregnant with PCOS It's possible to get pregnant when you have PCOS. But you might need medication to help you ovulate or use fertility technologies such as in vitro fertilization. Medicines to help you ovulate If you need help ovulating to get pregnant , certain medicines may help: Clomiphene ( Clomid , Serophene ), an antiestrogen drug you take at the beginning of your cycle. If clomiphene doesn’t help with ovulation, you may be prescribed the diabetes drug metformin . If clomiphene and metformin don’t work, your doctor may prescribe hormonal medications called gonadotropins. You get this medicine in a shot. Letrozole ( Femara ), which is sometimes used when other medications don’t work. Other options to improve your fertility are: Surgery: A procedure called ovarian drilling might make your ovaries work better when ovulation medications don't. But doctors do it less often than they used to, as better medications are available now. The surgeon makes a small cut in your belly and removes the parts of your ovaries that make too many androgens. In vitro fertilization, or IVF: In this procedure, your doctor removes one of your eggs from your body and combines it with sperm from your partner or a donor. They then place the fertilized egg back inside your uterus. This may be the most effective way to get pregnant when you have PCOS, but it can be expensive. Talk to your doctor about how you could increase your chances for a healthy pregnancy, including lifestyle changes before you conceive. Diet and Lifestyle Changes for PCOS and Fertility A healthy lifestyle that includes weight control, regular exercise , and blood sugar control can help improve your PCOS symptoms and your fertility. Managing weight Not everyone who has PCOS is overweight, but many are. Gaining a lot of weight can affect your hormones. If you’re obese or overweight , losing weight may help get your hormones back to normal levels. Losing just 10% of your body weight may help your menstrual cycle become more predictable. Your doctor may recommend choosing foods lower in calories and fat and controlling portion sizes. But losing weight isn't easy. A nutritionist or dietitian may be able to help. Also, some people find that keeping a journal or using an app to track meals and snacks can make things easier. PCOS diet To manage your blood sugar, your doctor may suggest focusing on foods that are lower in sugar and certain carbohydrates (carbs). Some carbs are good for you, such as those in high-fiber vegetables and fruits. But it's best to limit refined carbs, such as those found in white flour, white rice, white potatoes, sugar, and highly processed foods. These foods have a high glycemic index, which means they make your blood sugar rise quickly. Other healthy foods, such as poultry and other lean meats, fish, and whole grains, can help with your blood sugar levels, too. Try to have regular meals, as sticking to a schedule helps your body maintain consistent insulin levels. Exercising Regular exercise burns calories and increases muscle mass. This can help decrease insulin resistance, which can lower your androgen levels and help with symptoms. Exercise can also boost your mood and self-esteem. Getting enough sleep Lack of sleep can play a role in hormone imbalances, insulin resistance, and weight gain. Set the stage for restful sleep by: Going to sleep and waking up at about the same time each day Avoiding screens close to bedtime Making sure your bedroom is dark, cool, and quiet If you often have trouble getting at least 7 hours of sleep a night, talk to your doctor. Reducing stress A condition such as PCOS can be stressful. In turn, stress might make PCOS symptoms worse. Y our body makes cortisol (the so-called stress hormone) from progesterone and other hormones. This can upset the balance of these hormones in your body. Stress can also contribute to weight gain and depression, which are common challenges for people with PCOS. Exercise can help, and so can stress-management techniques such as breathing exercises and mindfulness meditation. Limiting caffeine While moderate levels of caffeine (up to about 4 cups of coffee a day) are fine, more than that might affect your sleep and maybe even your hormonal balance. Ask your doctor whether you should cut back on caffeine. Avoiding endocrine disruptors Chemicals called endocrine disruptors are thought to cause hormone imbalances and might even be linked to PCOS. Some common ones are biphenols (including BPA), parabens, phthalates, and triclosan. They’re found in plastics, cosmetics, industrial chemicals, and pesticides. They can also contaminate food, water, soil, and air. It's difficult to avoid these common chemicals. But some possible ways to reduce your exposure include: Avoid products that contain fragrance Store food in glass or stainless steel containers instead of plastic ones Avoid food from cans lined with BPA Wash your hands often, especially before you eat Use a vacuum with a HEPA filter Alternative Medicine for PCOS While no alternative treatments have been proven to help with PCOS symptoms, a few studies have found evidence that some might have benefits. Herbs and supplements A 2014 review of 33 studies found some evidence that these herbal medicines might help with PCOS symptoms: Chaste tree berry Black cohosh Cinnamon Tribulus terrestris , a plant used in Eastern medicine Licorice plant Licorice plant combined with Chinese peony The findings were strongest for chaste tree berry and black cohosh. But the researchers noted that we need more and better research into these possible benefits. A 2017 review of 24 studies looked at 11 herbs and supplements to see whether they might help with PCOS symptoms or complications. It found possible benefits for: Inositol, a type of sugar found in many plant foods Omega-3 fish oil supplements However, the researchers warned that the scientific evidence for these is weak. The review found little evidence of benefits for: Vitamin D Vitamin D plus calcium Cinnamon Chromium Selenium Vitamin B complex Black cohosh Chamomile tea Green tea A few other studies have found that berberine, a compound found in plants such as goldenseal, may help improve fertility and insulin resistance in people with PCOS. But we need more and better research into this. Keep in mind that the FDA doesn't regulate dietary supplements for effectiveness or safety. Always talk to your doctor before starting a new supplement. Ask about their potential side effects, interactions with medications you take, and the latest research about their effectiveness. Spearmint tea for PCOS Some studies have found that regularly drinking tea made from spearmint leaves could help balance hormone levels in those with PCOS. It may also reduce the growth of excess facial and body hair. The tea is caffeine-free, so you might try drinking 2-3 cups a day to see if it helps with your symptoms. But talk to your doctor first, especially if you're pregnant, trying to get pregnant, or have other health conditions. Acupuncture for PCOS Acupuncture is a type of complementary medicine in which a practitioner inserts thin needles into specific points on your body. Some studies have found it may help regulate hormones and ovulation and reduce insulin resistance in those with PCOS. But other researchers say there's not yet enough good evidence that it works as a treatment for PCOS. PCOS and Menopause Period-related PCOS symptoms often improve as menopause approaches. Your ovaries no longer work after menopause, so your androgen levels go down. And because you don't have periods anymore, irregular ones aren't a problem. But your androgen levels might still be higher than normal, so you might still have other symptoms. Further, your odds of developing PCOS complications such as diabetes and metabolic syndrome go up as you get older. Takeaways Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a hormonal condition that affects the ovaries. It interferes with your menstrual cycle and is a common cause of infertility. However, treatments can improve symptoms and help you conceive. PCOS FAQs How would I know if I have PCOS ? The most common symptoms are irregular periods, acne, excessive hair growth, and trouble getting pregnant. But some people don’t have any of these symptoms. If you think you might have PCOS, talk with your doctor. Does PCOS go away? PCOS never fully goes away, but the symptoms can improve over time or with treatment. For example, menopause can cause hormonal changes that relieve PCOS symptoms. Can I get pregnant with PCOS naturally ? Those with PCOS often have a hard time getting pregnant, but several treatments can help. When you have PCOS, you still release eggs (and get periods) occasionally, but this can be irregular and hard to time. That makes it difficult, but not impossible, to get pregnant without the help of treatment."
22,What Is Biliary Atresia?,"Biliary atresia is a rare disease of the bile ducts that affects only infants. Bile ducts are pathways that carry a digestive fluid called bile from the liver to the small intestine. Once there, it breaks down fats and absorbs vitamins. It then filters waste out of the body. With biliary atresia, these ducts swell and become blocked. Bile is trapped in the liver , where it starts to destroy cells. Over time, the liver can be scarred -- a condition called cirrhosis . Once this happens, it can't filter out toxins the way it should. Some babies get it in the womb. But most often, symptoms appear between 2 and 4 weeks after birth. Causes Doctors believe a number of things may trigger biliary atresia, including: Change in a gene Problem with the immune system Problem with the way the liver or bile ducts develop in the womb Toxic substances Viral or bacterial infection after birth It isn't passed down from one family member to another, and babies can't catch it from someone else. Girls who are born prematurely are most at risk. So are Asian and African-American babies. Symptoms If your baby has biliary atresia, one of the first things you'll notice is that their skin and the whites of their eyes look yellow. This is called jaundice . Jaundice is very common among infants, especially in those born before 38 weeks, but it usually goes away in 2 to 3 weeks. Jaundice caused by biliary atresia lasts longer than that. Their abdomen also may swell, they'll have gray or white stools, and their pee will be dark. This happens because their liver can't process bilirubin -- a reddish-brown substance that's made when red blood cells break down. It's what gives poop its brown color. Some babies also might have frequent nosebleeds or intense itching . Diagnosis Many liver conditions have the same symptoms as biliary atresia. To make sure they find the right cause, your child's doctor may test their blood for high levels of bilirubin. They may also do some or all of the following: X-rays: A small amount of radiation creates a picture that's recorded on film or a computer. This checks for an enlarged liver and spleen . Ultrasound : High-frequency sound waves show detailed images of their organs. Liver scans: Special X-rays use chemicals to create an image of their liver and bile ducts. This can show if and where the flow of bile is blocked. Liver biopsy : Their doctor will take a small sample of tissue so it can be looked at under a microscope. This can show if it's likely they have biliary atresia and help rule out other liver problems such as hepatitis . Diagnostic surgery: They'll be given medicine to make them sleep , and their doctor will make a small cut in their stomach area so they can look at their liver and bile ducts. Treatment The most common treatment is the Kasai procedure. It's done if the blocked bile ducts are outside the baby 's liver. During the operation, your baby 's surgeon will replace the blocked bile ducts with part of their intestine. This lets bile drain from their liver through the new ""duct"" and into their intestine. If it's done before your baby is 3 months old, the surgery has about an 80% success rate. If it's not successful, babies usually need a liver transplant within 1 to 2 years. If the blocked bile ducts are inside the liver, medication may help get rid of bile, and vitamin A , D, and E supplements may be prescribed. But a liver transplant probably will be needed. Outlook If a baby has a successful Kasai procedure, they may recover and have a full, active life. But in most cases, they'll need specialized medical care for the rest of their life. Eventually, they may also need a liver transplant."
23,What Is Primary Biliary Cholangitis?,"Primary biliary cholangitis is a disease that damages the bile ducts in your liver. Your doctor may also call it PBC. It used to be called primary biliary cirrhosis. These ducts have an important job. They carry a fluid called bile, which plays a key role in digestion, away from your liver. Bile is what helps your body absorb fats, cholesterol, and even some vitamins. It also helps get rid of worn-out red blood cells and other things your body doesn't need. When bile ducts don’t work the way they should, those substances stay in your liver. The bile backs up, and your liver gets inflamed and maybe even scarred. Over time, the scar tissue replaces healthy liver tissue, and the organ doesn’t work the way it should. This is usually a slow and gradual process. Your liver does OK for a while. And you’ll take medications to help it work better and manage your symptoms. But the disease can worsen over a few months or many years. One day, you may need a liver transplant . What Causes It? Doctors aren't totally sure. It isn’t passed down from parents to children, but there does seem to be a family link. It’s more common if you have a parent, brother, or sister who has it. Most people who get it are women, and most are in their 40s and 50s. The disease may be linked to immune system problems like thyroid trouble, pernicious anemia, or scleroderma . Things from outside your body -- smoking, chemicals, or infections -- can also trigger the disease. What Are the Symptoms? Early on, you might not notice any at all. You can live for many years without problems. Later, you might feel tired or have itchy skin or dry eyes and mouth. As the disease gets worse, you might notice: Yellow skin and eyes ( jaundice ) Swollen feet and ankles Pain and swelling in your abdomen Bone, muscle, or joint pain Darkened skin How Is It Diagnosed? If you have any of these symptoms, your doctor might suggest blood tests. They’ll tell them how well your liver works and if you have any immune system issues. They may also want you to have imaging tests like an ultrasound , CT scan , MRI, or endoscopy (ERCP). These provide a more detailed look at your liver and the area around it. They may also suggest a liver biopsy. They’ll remove a small piece of liver tissue and examine it in the lab to look for damage or disease. How Is It Treated? There's no cure, but medications can slow down the disease. The most common drug is ursodiol (ursodeoxycholic acid), which helps move bile through your liver. Another drug, obeticholic acid ( Ocaliva ), can be used with ursodiol or alone to treat PBC. There are also newer drugs to treat symptoms like itching and fatigue. Your doctor may suggest you make some changes in your daily life. If you drink alcohol, stop. It puts a strain on your liver. Choose low-sodium foods and exercise regularly to ease your symptoms. When medications no longer help, a liver transplant may be an option."
24,Binge Drinking,"What Is Binge Drinking? Binge drinking is when you drink enough alcohol to bring your blood-alcohol content up to the legal limit for driving. That works out to about five alcoholic drinks for men or four for women in less than 2 hours. A drink is 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1.5 ounces of liquor. Most American adults drink alcohol at least occasionally, but about 1 in 4 knock back several drinks in a short period of time at least once a year. About 1 in 6 American adults say they regularly binge drink, sometimes several times a month. They typically have about seven drinks on these binges. Adults under 35 are more likely to do this than other age groups, and men are twice as likely as women. People who make more than $75,000 a year and are more educated are most likely to binge drink. Learn more about alcohol abuse vs dependence . Binge Drinking Signs Binge drinking has different effects on different people. If your alcohol use is causing trouble for you at work, at home, in social situations, or at school, it’s a problem. Other signs of an issue can include: Drinking more than you planned Drinking more often Drinking early in the day Feeling defensive about your drinking Not being able to slow down or stop your drinking Needing more alcohol to get the same effect Giving up activities you enjoy to spend more time drinking Feeling shaky, weak, or nauseated when you haven’t had a drink in a while Taking part in dangerous activities when you drink Having “blackouts,” or gaps in your memory, after drinking If you think you have a drinking problem, talk to your doctor. They can give you some tips for cutting back or refer you to help if you need it to quit. Federal and state health agencies also offer resources and can refer you to someone who can help. Binge Drinking Health Effects Researchers blame this kind of heavy drinking for more than half of the roughly 88,000 alcohol-related deaths -- from car crashes, alcohol poisoning , suicide , and violence -- that happen every year. Binge drinking also can: Throw off your heartbeat, which can lead to problems like heart attacks or strokes Make you more likely to take part in risky sexual behavior or get a sexually transmitted disease (STD) Raise the odds that you’ll be a victim of sexual violence Cause memory problems in young adults And it has costs beyond the bar tab. Heavy drinking is believed to cost the U.S. economy more than $200 billion a year in lost productivity, health costs, and property damage. Short- and long-term effects of binge drinking Short-term effects of binge drinking include: Poor motor control and slower reaction times Shorter attention span Dehydration Sleepiness Depression Hostility Low blood pressure Slower breathing Miscarriage or stillbirth in pregnant women, or fetal alcohol spectrum disorders in their babies Alcohol poisoning, which can lead to vomiting, seizures, a coma, and death Over time, binge drinking may cause: Weight gain High blood pressure Trouble sleeping Social isolation Mental health problems Loss of brain volume in young people Weakened immune system Heart disease Liver problems Stroke Higher chances of breast , throat, esophagus , or colon cancer Binge Drinking and Alcohol Use Disorder Nine out of 10 binge drinkers aren’t dependent on alcohol, but doctors and scientists think they’re more likely to develop alcohol use disorder. The chances are especially high for people who drink heavily during their teen years. Teenage binge drinkers are about three times more likely to develop alcohol use disorder. Binge Drinking Prevention Take these steps to lower your risk while drinking: Limit how much you have at one time. If you drink, experts recommend an average of no more than one drink per day for women and two for men. Drink more slowly. Have some food while you drink. Alternate alcoholic drinks with nonalcoholic ones. Water is best. Make a plan. Drink with people you trust, and know how you’ll get home safely."
25,"Bulimia: Symptoms, Treatments, and Prevention","What Is Bulimia? Bulimia is a psychological eating disorder in which you have episodes of binge eating (consuming a large quantity of food in one sitting). During these binges, you have no sense of control over your eating. Afterward, you try inappropriate ways to lose weight such as: Vomiting Fasting Enemas Excessive use of laxatives and diuretics Compulsive exercising Bulimia, also called bulimia nervosa, tends to start in late childhood or early adulthood. You usually binge and purge in secret. You feel disgusted and ashamed when you binge, and relieved once you purge. People with bulimia usually weigh within the normal range for their age and height. But they may fear gaining weight , want to lose weight, and feel very dissatisfied with their bodies. What Are the Causes and Risk Factors for Bulimia? We don't know the exact cause of bulimia . But research suggests that a mixture of certain personality traits, emotions, and thinking patterns, as well as biological and environmental factors, might be responsible. Researchers believe this eating disorder may begin with dissatisfaction with your body and extreme concern with your size and shape. Usually, you have low self-esteem and fear becoming overweight . The fact that bulimia tends to run in families also suggests that you might inherit a risk for the disorder. Other risk factors include: Being female Depression and anxiety disorders Substance use disorders Traumatic events Stress Frequent dieting What Are Symptoms of Bulimia? Different people may have different symptoms of bulimia. You may notice changes in both your body and your behavior. Unlike the eating disorder anorexia , someone with bulimia may not lose a lot of weight , so it can be harder to tell what’s going on. Physical symptoms of bulimia can include: Dental problems Sore throat Swollen glands in your neck and face Heartburn , indigestion , bloating Irregular periods Weakness, exhaustion, bloodshot eyes Calluses on your knuckles or backs of your hands from making yourself vomit Gaining and losing weight often. Your weight is usually in the normal range, but you may be overweight . Dizziness or fainting Feeling cold all the time Sleep problems Dry skin , and dry and brittle nails Behavioral symptoms of bulimia may include: Eating uncontrollably, followed by purging. The National Institutes of Health says you have bulimia if you do this at least twice a week for 3 months. Hoarding or stealing food Food rituals, like eating only a certain food, chewing more than necessary, or not allowing foods to touch Skipping meals or eating only small portions during meals Feeling out of control Vomiting or abusing laxatives, diuretics, enemas, or other medications to try to lose weight Using the bathroom frequently after meals Excessive exercising Preoccupation with body weigh.  Your thoughts about body weight and shape even determine how you feel overall. Depression or mood swings Drinking large amounts of water or calorie-free beverages Often using mints, gum, or mouthwash Avoiding friends and activities you used to enjoy If you or any member of your family has an unhealthy focus on weight and size and/or appears overly interested in food, call a doctor. The sooner you're treated, the better your chances for a successful outcome. Does Bulimia Have Complications? Another reason to get prompt treatment is to avoid the serious problems bulimia can cause. They include: Erosion of tooth enamel because of repeated exposure to stomach acid Dental cavities and discolored teeth Tooth sensitivity to hot or cold food Gum infections Swelling and soreness in your salivary glands (from repeated vomiting) Sore and inflamed throat Stomach ulcers Ruptures of your stomach or esophagus Disruption of your poop habits Dehydration .  This can cause imbalances in certain minerals, called electrolytes , such as calcium and potassium . Low levels of potassium or sodium can cause potentially life-threatening heart or kidney problems. Abnormal electrolyte levels, and drops in blood sugar levels , can also cause seizures . Irregular heartbeat Heart attack (in severe cases) Lower sex drive Higher risk for suicidal behavior Self-harm, such as cutting yourself Alcohol or drug misuse Gastroparesis , in which your stomach takes too long to digest food How is Bulimia Diagnosed? If your doctor thinks you might have bulimia, they'll probably ask you about your eating habits, if you've lost or gained weight, and whether you have any physical symptoms. They may also: Give you a complete physical exam Do blood and urine tests Give you an EKG to see if you have heart problems resulting from bulimia Do a psychological exam that includes questions about your body image You may also have other tests to rule out medical causes for weight loss or gain. What Are Bulimia Treatments and Home Remedies? To treat bulimia, your doctor will consider your physical and psychological needs. Your treatment may include counseling and medications . Often, it involves a team of medical, nutritional, and mental health professionals. They'll try to help you restore your health and healthy eating patterns. Medical treatments Medications. The antidepressant fluoxetine ( Prozac ) is FDA-approved for the treatment of bulimia. Doctors sometimes recommend other antidepressants or types of medicines. Hospitalization. This doesn't happen often. But with serious cases of bulimia, you might be treated in a hospital for a short time. Most eating-disorder programs offer outpatient treatment. Psychotherapy Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). In this type of therapy , you learn normal eating habits and watch out for things that lead you to binge or purge. You challenge irrational thoughts and unhealthy behaviors as they arise. Family-based treatment (FBT). Often used in children and teens with bulimia, it helps the family deal with the illness and the issues it can cause. Interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT). This focuses on problems in your relationships with other people in your life. The way you interact with others can affect your emotional state and mental health . Nutritional therapy The goal is to teach you good eating habits. You work with a dietitian to learn to recognize your body's signals of hunger and fullness. They help you stabilize your weight and gain a healthier attitude toward food. Self-care for bulimia Along with following your treatment and therapy plan, you can take steps to care for yourself: Look after your body. Include healthy foods in your diet to make sure you're getting the nutrients you need. Ask your doctor whether supplements are right for you. And check with your doctor about how much exercise is healthy for you. Connect with others. Support from friends and family can help you overcome unhealthy habits and feel better about yourself. A support group might help, too. The National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders lists several. The National Eating Disorders Association also offers help via chat, text, or phone. Avoid your triggers. Don't linger over social media images of people with bodies that are unrealistic for you. Stay away from the scale and your mirror. If stress or boredom triggers binges, practice using healthier ways to deal with them. What’s the Outlook for People With Bulimia? Bulimia is difficult to cure. Many people improve, but some may relapse from time to time. In addition, some people who are considered ""cured"" continue with less-than-normal eating patterns throughout their lives. But in general, the outlook for people with bulimia is more positive than the outlook for people with anorexia , another eating disorder. Can Bulimia Be Prevented? Because we don't know exactly why people get bulimia, it's hard to know how to prevent it. But there are ways to teach children and teens healthy attitudes and behaviors about food and body image. They include: Have regular family mealtimes as often as possible. Don't talk about weight with your children. Instead, focus on healthy habits . Try to promote a healthy, realistic body image in your kids. Discourage fad dieting. Discourage fad dieting. Once bulimia has developed, prevention mostly focuses on trying to keep it from getting worse and harming a person's body and sense of self. This can be difficult, since eating disorders can go on secretly for a long time before others suspect what is happening and intervene. The same is true for relapses during recovery. You might need to go back to the doctor if bulimia symptoms come back. Call your doctor if: You find yourself secretly binge eating, then vomiting or using laxatives. You avoid eating in front of other people. Your child has an unreasonable fear of being fat and thinks they are fat when they are not. Your child avoids eating with others or often visits the bathroom immediately after meals. When to Call 911 Sometimes, people with bulimia have depression as well as their eating disorder. Call 911 if you or someone who has this condition are thinking about committing suicide . You can also call the national suicide prevention hotline at 800-273-8255."
26,Overview of Biofeedback,"When you raise your hand to wave hello to a friend, or lift your knee to take another step on the Stairmaster, you control these actions. Other body functions -- like heart rate, skin temperature, and blood pressure -- are controlled involuntarily by your nervous system. You don't think about making your heart beat faster. It just happens in response to your environment, like when you're nervous, excited, or exercising. One technique can help you gain more control over these normally involuntary functions. It's called biofeedback , and the therapy is used to help prevent or treat conditions, including migraine headaches , chronic pain , incontinence , and high blood pressure. The idea behind biofeedback is that, by harnessing the power of your mind and becoming aware of what's going on inside your body, you can gain more control over your health. How Does Biofeedback Therapy Work? Researchers aren't exactly sure how or why biofeedback works. They do know that biofeedback promotes relaxation, which can help relieve a number of conditions that are related to stress. During a biofeedback session, electrodes are attached to your skin. Finger sensors can also be used. These electrodes/sensors send signals to a monitor, which displays a sound, flash of light, or image that represents your heart and breathing rate, blood pressure, skin temperature, sweating , or muscle activity. When you're under stress, these functions change. Your heart rate speeds up, your muscles tighten, your blood pressure rises, you start to sweat, and your breathing quickens. You can see these stress responses as they happen on the monitor, and then get immediate feedback as you try to stop them. Biofeedback sessions are typically done in a therapist's office, but there are computer programs that connect the biofeedback sensor to your own computer. A biofeedback therapist helps you practice relaxation exercises, which you fine-tune to control different body functions. For example, you might use a relaxation technique to turn down the brainwaves that activate when you have a headache . Several different relaxation exercises are used in biofeedback therapy, including: Deep breathing Progressive muscle relaxation -- alternately tightening and then relaxing different muscle groups Guided imagery -- concentrating on a specific image (such as the color and texture of an orange) to focus your mind and make you feel more relaxed Mindfulness meditation -- focusing your thoughts and letting go of negative emotions As you slow your heart rate, lower your blood pressure, and ease muscle tension, you'll get instant feedback on the screen. Eventually, you'll learn how to control these functions on your own, without the biofeedback equipment. Different types of biofeedback are used to monitor different body functions: Electromyogram (EMG). This measures muscle activity and tension. It may be used for back pain , headaches , anxiety disorders, muscle retraining after injury, and incontinence . Thermal. This measures skin temperature. It may be used for headache and Raynaud's disease. Neurofeedback or electroencephalography (EEG). This measures brain waves. It may be used for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ), epilepsy and other seizure disorders. Electrodermal activity ( EDA ). This measures sweating and can be used for pain and anxiety . Heart rate variability (HRA). This measures heart rate. It may be used for anxiety, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ), and irregular heartbeat . Each biofeedback therapy session lasts about 60-90 minutes. Usually, you can start to see biofeedback benefits within 10 sessions or less. Some conditions, such as high blood pressure , can take more sessions to improve. Biofeedback Uses Biofeedback can help many different conditions. Here is a rundown of some biofeedback benefits: Chronic pain . By helping you identify tight muscles and then learn to relax those muscles, biofeedback may help relieve the discomfort of conditions like low back pain, abdominal pain , temporomandibular joint disorders (TMJ), and fibromyalgia. For pain relief, biofeedback can benefit people of all ages, from children to older adults. Headaches. Headaches are one of the best-studied biofeedback uses. Muscle tension and stress can trigger migraines and other types of headaches, and can make headache symptoms worse. There is good evidence that biofeedback therapy can relax muscles and ease stress to reduce both the frequency and severity of headaches. Biofeedback seems to be especially beneficial for headaches when it's combined with medications. Anxiety. Anxiety relief is one of the most common uses of biofeedback. Biofeedback lets you become more aware of your body's responses when you're stressed and anxious. Then you can learn how to control those responses. Urinary Incontinence . Biofeedback therapy can help people who have trouble controlling the urge to use the bathroom. Biofeedback can help women find and strengthen the pelvic floor muscles that control bladder emptying. After several sessions of biofeedback, women with incontinence may be able to reduce their urgent need to urinate and the number of accidents they have. Biofeedback can also help children who wet the bed, as well as people with fecal incontinence (the inability to control bowel movements ). Unlike drugs used to treat incontinence , biofeedback doesn't tend to cause side effects. High Blood Pressure . Evidence on the use of biofeedback for high blood pressure has been mixed. Although the technique does seem to lower blood pressure slightly, biofeedback isn't as effective as medication for blood pressure control. Other biofeedback uses include: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) High blood pressure Raynaud's disease Injury Asthma Constipation Epilepsy Rheumatoid arthritis Getting Started With Biofeedback Therapy Many different health care providers offer biofeedback therapy, including psychiatrists, psychologists, and general physicians. To find a qualified biofeedback provider in your area, contact an organization like the Association for Applied Psychophysiology & Biofeedback."
27,First Aid Kits,"Almost everyone will need to use a first aid kit at some time. Make time to prepare home and travel kits for your family’s safety. First aid kits may be basic or comprehensive. What you need depends on your medical training and your distance from professional medical help. Ready-made first aid kits are commercially available from chain stores or outdoor retailers, but it’s easy to make smart, inexpensive first aid kits yourself. Home and Travel First Aid Kit Basics Home first aid kits are usually used for treating these types of minor traumatic injuries: Burns Cuts Abrasions (scrapes) Stings Splinters Sprains Strains First aid kits for travel need to be more comprehensive because a drug store may or may not be accessible. In addition to personal medical items, the kit should contain items to help alleviate the common symptoms of viral respiratory infections such as these: Fever Nasal congestion Cough Sore throat It should also contain items to treat these ailments: Cuts Mild pain Gastrointestinal problems Skin problems Allergies Make Your Own First Aid Kit Try to keep your kit small and simple. Stock it with multi-use items. Almost anything that provides good visibility of contents can be used for a household first aid kit. If your kit will be on the move, a water-resistant, drop-proof container is best. Inexpensive nylon bags, personal kits, fanny packs, or makeup cases serve very well. You do not need to spend a lot of money on a fancy ""medical bag."" Use resealable sandwich or oven bags to group and compartmentalize items. Put wound supplies in one bag and medications in another. How to Use a First Aid Kit Make sure you know how to properly use all of the items in your kit, especially the medications . Train others in your family to use the kit. You may be the one who needs first aid. Pack and use barrier items such as latex gloves to protect yourself from the bodily fluids of others. Check the kit twice a year and replace expired drugs. Find out the phone number of your regional poison control center at the American Association of Poison Control Centers website and keep the number with your kit. Where to keep your first aid kit: The best place to keep your first aid kit is in the kitchen. Most family activities take place here. The bathroom has too much humidity, which shortens the shelf life of items. The travel kit is for true trips away from home. Keep it in a suitcase, backpack, or dry bag, depending on the activity. A first aid kit for everyday use in the car should be just like the home first aid kit. For that matter, you could keep similar kits in your boat (inside a waterproof bag), travel trailer, mobile home, camper, cabin, vacation home, and wherever you spend time. Must-Have First Aid Kit Essentials You can buy all items for your first aid kits at a well-stocked drug store. Ask the pharmacist for help in selecting items. Home kit : A household first aid kit should include these items: Adhesive tape Anesthetic spray ( Bactine ) or lotion ( Calamine , Campho-Phenique ) -- for itching rashes and insect bites 4"" x 4"" sterile gauze pads -- for covering and cleaning wounds, as a soft eye patch 2"", 3"", and 4"" Ace bandages -- for wrapping sprained or strained joints, for wrapping gauze on to wounds, for wrapping on splints Adhesive bandages (all sizes) Oral antihistamines -- diphenhydramine ( Benadryl causes drowsiness) or loratadine ( Claritin doesn't cause drowsiness) -- for allergic reactions, itching rashes (Avoid topical antihistamine creams because they may worsen the rash in some people.) Topical corticosteroids, such as over the counter Hydrocortisone 1% for rashes Aloe vera topical gel or cream for burn relief Exam gloves -- for infection protection, also to make into ice packs when filled with water and frozen Polysporin antibiotic cream -- to apply to simple wounds Non adhesive pads (Telfa) -- for covering wounds and burns Pocket mask for CPR Resealable oven bag -- as a container for contaminated articles, can become an ice pack Safety pins (large and small) -- for splinter removal and for securing triangular bandage sling Scissors Triangular bandage -- as a sling, towel, tourniquet Tweezers -- for splinter or stinger or tick removal Travel First Aid Kit Essentials Travel kit : A travel first aid kit may contain these items: Adhesive tape 4"" x 4"" sterile gauze pads Antacid -- for indigestion Antidiarrheal ( Imodium , Pepto-Bismol, for example) Antihistamine cream Antiseptic agent (small bottle liquid soap) -- for cleaning wounds and hands Aspirin -- for mild pain, heart attack Adhesive bandages (all sizes) Diphenhydramine ( Benadryl ) or loratadine ( Claritin ) -- oral antihistamine Topical corticosteroids, such as over the counter Hydrocortisone 1% for rashes Aloe vera topical gel or cream for burn relief Book on first aid Cigarette lighter -- to sterilize instruments and to be able to start a fire in the wilderness (to keep warm and to make smoke to signal for help, for examples) Cough medication Dental kit -- for broken teeth , loss of crown or filling Exam gloves Small flashlight Ibuprofen ( Advil is one brand name) Insect repellant Knife (small Swiss Army-type) Moleskin -- to apply to blisters or hot spots Nasal spray decongestant -- for nasal congestion from colds or allergies Nonadhesive wound pads (Telfa) Polysporin antibiotic ointment Oral decongestant Personal medications and items Phone card with at least 60 minutes of time (and not a close expiration date) plus at least 10 quarters for pay phones and a list of important people to reach in an emergency Plastic resealable bags (oven and sandwich) Pocket mask for CPR Safety pins (large and small) Scissors Sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or more Thermometer Tweezers"
28,Children and Teens With Bipolar Disorder,"Although bipolar disorder more commonly develops in older teenagers and young adults, it can appear in children as young as 6. In recent years, it's become a controversial diagnosis. Some experts believe it is rare and being overdiagnosed; others think the opposite. At this point, it's hard to be sure just how common it is. Another diagnosis, called Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD) also has been established to describe children ages 6-18 who have severe and persistent irritability and temper outbursts that don't meet conventional definitions of bipolar disorder . So it's important not to jump to conclusions. If your child is diagnosed with bipolar disorder , you might want to get a second opinion before embarking on a treatment plan. Make sure you're comfortable with your child's health care provider. Bipolar Disorder in Young Children Diagnosing bipolar disorder in young children is difficult, because many of the symptoms are similar to those of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) or conduct disorders -- or even just normal, childhood behavior. One problem is that medications used for ADHD are often stimulants, which can potentially trigger mania in children with bipolar disorder . Young children in a manic phase might be more irritable than adults; they may be more likely to have psychotic symptoms, hearing and seeing things that aren't real. During a depressive episode, they might be more likely to complain of physical symptoms, like aches and pains. One of the most notable differences is that bipolar disorder in children cycles much more quickly. While manic and depressive periods may be separated by weeks, months, or years in adults, they can happen within a single day in children. How Can I Help my Bipolar Child? As the parent of a child with bipolar disorder, there's a lot you can do to keep your child well. Here are some suggestions. Follow the medication schedule. You absolutely must make sure that your child gets the medication they need for bipolar disorder. Use timers, pillboxes, notes, or whatever it takes for you to remember. If your child needs medication at school, talk to their teacher or school nurse -- schools may not allow students to take medication on their own. Monitor side effects. Most drugs used for bipolar disorder (including mood-stabilizers, antipsychotic medications, and even antidepressants) were originally tested in adults, and only a few have been well-studied in children and adolescents. Some children are more prone to side effects from some of these drugs, such as weight gain and changes in blood sugar and cholesterol caused by some atypical antipsychotics. Ask your child's health care provider what symptoms to watch for and you may need to routinely monitor bloodwork. The FDA has issued a warning that using some types of antidepressants or other medicines used to treat depression may increase the risk of suicide in children, adolescents and young adults up to 24 years old. Talk to your child's teachers. In some cases, a child with bipolar disorder may need special allowances at school. They may need extra breaks or less homework during difficult times. So work out an agreement with your child's teachers or the school principal. In some cases, you may need to take your child out of school for a while, at least until their bipolar symptoms stabilize. Keep a routine. Children with bipolar disorder can really benefit from a daily schedule. Help them get up, eat meals, exercise, and go to bed at roughly the same times each day. Do what you can to reduce stress in the household. Consider family therapy. Having a child with bipolar disorder can be disruptive to the whole family. It can put extra stress on your marriage. Your other children may not understand what's wrong with their sibling, or they may be resentful of all the attention they are getting. Going to family therapy can help you all recognize and deal with these issues. Take suicidal threats seriously. No parent wants to think about their children hurting themselves. But unfortunately, it can happen, even with young children. So if your child begins to express a desire to die, or engages in life-threatening behavior, don't ignore it. Remove any weapons or dangerous drugs from the house. And get help right away. Teenagers With Bipolar Disorder In older teenagers, the symptoms and treatment of bipolar disorder are much more similar to those seen in adults. But having a teenager with this condition presents a lot of distinct problems. As they get older, teenagers might be resentful if they feel that you're imposing treatment on them. So let them into the conversation. Talk frankly -- along with your child's doctor or therapist -- about treatment options. Try not to develop an adversarial relationship with your child over their treatment or medication. As with adults, it's key that teenagers with bipolar disorder avoid alcohol and drugs, which can interact with medications or bring on or worsen mood episodes. The risks of developing a substance abuse problem are much higher in teens with bipolar disorder than in their peers. It's also important to maintain regular routines around sleep and wake times, and to develop effective coping strategies for managing stress and distress."
29,Bird Flu FAQ,"What Is Bird Flu? Bird flu , or avian influenza , is a viral infection spread from bird to bird. The most common kind of bird flu is the H5N1 strain. It's mostly a threat to birds and doesn’t spread easily among people, but there was a major outbreak of bird flu in people in 2014. The very few cases of human-to-human transmission were among people with exceptionally close contact, such as a mother who caught the virus while caring for their sick infant . Migrating water fowl -- most notably wild ducks -- are the natural carriers of bird flu viruses. Scientists suspect that infection can spread from wild fowl to domestic poultry. What Are the Symptoms of Bird Flu? Bird flu symptoms in people can vary. The illness could start out with flu-like symptoms that include fever, cough, sore throat, and muscle aches. But it may worsen to include: Gut problems: Nausea, belly pain, diarrhea, and vomiting. Breathing problems: Shortness of breath, serious  respiratory distress or failure, pneumonia, and other respiratory diseases. Brain or nervous system changes: You might notice shifts in behavior, thinking, or even organ function. Seizures are possible in serious cases. In February 2005, researchers in Vietnam reported human cases of bird flu in which the virus infected the brains and digestive tracts of two children. Both died. These cases show that bird flu in humans may not always look like typical cases of flu. Scientists have identified more than a dozen different strains, or variants, of bird flu. H5N1, one of the deadliest strains for humans, has caused 456 bird flu deaths since 2003, according to the World Health Organization. How Do Humans Get Bird Flu? People catch bird flu by close contact with birds or bird droppings. In the 2014 outbreak, some people caught H5N1 from cleaning or plucking infected birds. There were reports in China of infection via inhalation of aerosolized materials in live bird markets. It's also possible that some people were infected after swimming or bathing in water contaminated with the droppings of infected birds. And some infections have occurred in people who handle fighting cocks. People don't catch the virus from eating fully cooked chicken or eggs . There were a few cases where one infected person caught the bird flu virus from another person, but only after close personal contact. In Indonesia in 2006, bird flu spread to eight members of one family. Seven of them died. It's not clear exactly how this happened. Family members likely had similar contacts with infected birds. They may also have shared genes that made them particularly susceptible to the virus. However, casual contact does not seem to be involved. Has Bird Flu Been Seen in the U.S.? Various strains of bird flu pop up in U.S. poultry from time to time. When they do, all affected poultry flocks are culled. For example, in 2004, a highly dangerous bird flu strain appeared in a Texas chicken flock. The outbreak involved an H5N2 virus (not the H5N1 bird flu). By April 2004, the outbreak had been eradicated. No human infections were detected. What Are the Types of Bird Flu? The bird flu virus, avian influenza A, is divided into two main categories: Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) causes more serious illness in chickens and is more likely to kill them. Low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) causes less serious illness in chickens and is less likely to cause death. Both versions can spread quickly through bird flocks and may cause serious illness in humans. This is important because birds infected with LPAI viruses may show little or no sign of disease as it spreads to animals or humans. Viruses often change over time, leading to different subtypes called strains. When bird flu infects humans, which is rare, it's most often from strains known as H5, H7, and H9. Less commonly, researchers have detected H10N8, H10N7, and H6N8 strains in humans. Is There a Bird Flu Vaccine? Yes, but you can't make an appointment to get it. The FDA approved the first vaccine to prevent human infection with one strain of the bird flu (H5N1) in 2007. But it’s not been made commercially available to the general public. The U.S. government purchased the vaccine in case it needed to be distributed by public health officials. Is There a Treatment for Bird Flu? The flu drugs oseltamivir ( Tamiflu ), peramivir (Rapivab), or zanamivir (Relenza) may help treat bird flu in people, although more studies are needed. These drugs must be given soon after symptoms appear."
30,Your Guide to Prenatal Testing,"When you’re pregnant, prenatal tests give you information about your health and your baby’s. They help detect any problems that could affect them, like birth defects or genetic diseases. The results can help you make the best health care decisions before and after your child is born. Prenatal tests are helpful, but it’s important to know how to interpret what they find. A positive test result doesn’t always mean your baby will be born with a disorder. You’ll want to talk with your doctor, midwife , or other health care provider about what the tests mean and what you should do once you have the results. Doctors recommend some prenatal tests for all pregnant women. Only some women will need other screening tests to check for certain genetic problems. Routine Prenatal Tests There are different prenatal tests you can get in your first, second, and third trimester . Some check your health, and others get information about your baby. Throughout your pregnancy, you’ll get routine exams to make sure you’re healthy. Your health care provider will check samples of your blood and urine for certain conditions, including: HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases Anemia Diabetes Hepatitis B Preeclampsia , a type of high blood pressure They’ll also check your blood type and whether your blood cells have a protein called the Rh factor. You may also get: Pap smear Group B Strep screening. Your doctor will swab the skin in and around your vagina to check for this type of bacteria. This usually happens in the last month before you give birth. Ultrasound . This technology uses sound waves to make pictures of your baby and your organs. If your pregnancy is normal, you’ll have it twice, once near the beginning to see how far along you are, and the second time around 18-20 weeks to check your baby’s growth and make sure their organs are developing properly. Prenatal Genetic Tests Doctors also can use prenatal tests to look for signs that your baby is at risk for certain genetic disorders or birth defects. You don’t have to have these tests, but your doctor may suggest some to make sure your baby is healthy. They’re especially important for women who have a higher risk of having a baby with a birth defect or a genetic problem.This is you if you: Are over age 35 Have had a premature baby or a baby with a birth defect before Have a genetic disorder or one that runs in your family or the other parent’s family Have a medical condition like diabetes , high blood pressure , a seizure disorder, or an autoimmune disorder such as lupus Have had miscarriages or stillborn babies in the past Have had gestational diabetes or preeclampsia when you were pregnant before Some prenatal genetic tests are screening tests. They tell you if your baby has a higher risk of having a certain disorder or disease, but they can’t tell you for certain that they’ll be born with it. Other “diagnostic” tests will give you a more definite answer. Usually, you’ll get this kind after you have a positive result on a screening test. To start, your doctor may want to test you and the child’s other parent for the genes that cause certain genetic diseases, like cystic fibrosis , Tay-Sachs disease, sickle cell disease, and others. If both of you have a gene for one of these diseases in your DNA, you could pass it on to your baby, even if you don't have the disease itself. The exam is called a carrier test. Your doctor can use one or more different screening tests to check your baby for a genetic problem, including: Ultrasound . You’ll already have one of these early in your pregnancy to make sure everything is going well. But if you have a high-risk pregnancy, you’ll need this exam more often. Around 11-14 weeks, doctors can use it to look at the back of your baby’s neck. Folds or thick skin there could mean a higher risk of Down syndrome. Your doctor also may take a sample of your blood at the same time. Cell-free fetal DNA testing . Doctors use this test to find your baby’s DNA in your blood and check it for Down syndrome and two other genetic conditions, trisomy 18 and trisomy 13. This test has become more common now, even for women not over 35. You can have this done after 10 weeks of your pregnancy. Doctors don’t recommend it for every woman, usually only those who have a high-risk pregnancy. It’s not available everywhere, and some health insurance policies don’t cover it. Talk to your doctor about whether you need this test. Integrated Screening . There are two phases to this test. In the first part, doctors combine the results of the ultrasound looking at your baby’s neck and the blood tests you got at 11-14 weeks. Then, they’ll take a second blood sample between 16-18 weeks. The results measure your baby’s risk for Down syndrome and spina bifida, a spinal cord and brain disorder. Sequential Screen . This is similar to integrated screening, but your doctor reviews the results with you right after the first phase at 11-14 weeks. It’s not as accurate as the longer test, but it lets you know your baby’s risk earlier. If the screening finds there may be a problem, your doctor will use more tests to find out for sure. If the screening doesn’t find a risk, you’ll most likely get the second blood test at 16-18 weeks to be safe. Triple or quadruple screening test. Doctors check your blood for hormones and proteins that come from your baby or your placenta, the organ that brings them oxygen and nutrients. The test can look for three different substances (triple screening) or four (quadruple screening). Certain amounts of these mean your baby has a higher chance of having a birth defect or a genetic disease. This test happens in the second trimester , usually at 15 to 20 weeks. Other Tests If you get a positive result on a screening, your doctor can use other tests to look for a problem. Amniocentesis . Using a thin needle in your belly, your doctor will take a sample of the fluid that surrounds your baby and check it for genetic disorders or birth defects. The procedure does carry some risk. About 1 in 300 to 500 women will miscarry because of amniocentesis . Your doctor can tell you if it’s important for you to have this. Chorionic villus sampling (CVS). Doctors take a small piece of your placenta by putting a needle through your belly or a small tube up your vagina . They test the sample for Down syndrome and other genetic conditions. Only some high-risk women will need this test, usually if a screening found a risk of a birth defect. The procedure will tell you for sure if there’s a problem, but it also comes with a risk of miscarriage that’s similar to amniocentesis. Talk to your doctor about whether you should have CVS. What Do I Do Once I Have the Results? Prenatal test results can help you make important health care decisions. But it’s important to remember that many of them tell you it’s possible, but not certain, that your baby will be born with a disorder. No test is 100% accurate. Talk to your doctor about the results you get and what they mean. A genetics counselor can also help you decide what to do after a positive result and what life will be like for your child if they have a disorder. Questions for Your Doctor If your doctor recommends prenatal testing , consider asking: Why do I need these tests? What will the results tell me? What will they not show? What happens if I don't get the test? What will I do with the results? How accurate are the tests? What are the risks? How long will it take to get the results? What does it feel like? How much do they cost? Will my insurance cover them? Will anyone else (like my insurance company) have access to the results, especially of genetic tests? What will the results mean for my family? Can I decide not to get the results even if the test has already been done? Where do I get the tests done?"
31,Skin Conditions: Pigmented Birthmarks,"Birthmarks are colored skin spots that either are present at birth or develop shortly after birth. Birthmarks can be many different colors, including brown, tan, black, pale blue, pink, white, red, or purple. Some birthmarks are only colorations of the surface of the skin; others are raised above the surface of the skin or extend into the tissues under the skin. What Causes Birthmarks? The cause of most birthmarks is unknown. Most birthmarks are not inherited. Many folk tales and myths exist about the causes of birthmarks, but none of these stories have been proven to explain the true causes of birthmarks. Do Birthmarks Need to Be Treated? Most birthmarks need no treatment. They often fade as a child grows older. However, some birthmarks may need treatment because of their location. For example, a raised birthmark near a child's eye may interfere with their ability to see. In rare cases, birthmarks are associated with other conditions, such as growths on the liver, lungs, stomach, or intestines. Types of Birthmarks There are two main categories of birthmarks -- red birthmarks and pigmented birthmarks. Red birthmarks are colored, vascular (having to do with blood vessels) skin markings that develop before or shortly after birth. Pigmented birthmarks are skin markings that are present at birth. Their color ranges from brown or black to bluish or blue-gray. Types of Pigmented Birthmarks Congenital melanocytosis , previously called Mongolian spots , usually are bluish and look like bruises. They often appear on the buttocks and/or lower back, but they sometimes also appear on the trunk or arms. The spots are seen most often in people who have darker skin. Pigmented nevi (moles) are growths on the skin that usually are flesh-colored, brown or black. Moles can appear anywhere on the skin, alone or in groups. Moles occur when cells in the skin grow in a cluster instead of being spread throughout the skin. Moles may darken after exposure to the sun, during the teen years, while taking some birth control pills, and during pregnancy./p> Congenital nevi are moles that are present at birth. These birthmarks have a slightly increased risk of becoming skin cancer, depending on their size. Larger congenital nevi have a greater risk of developing skin cancer than do smaller congenital nevi. All congenital nevi should be examined by a health care provider and any change in the birthmark should be reported. Cafe-au-lait spots are light tan or light brown spots that are usually oval in shape. They usually appear at birth but may develop in the first few years of a child's life. Cafe-au-lait spots may be a normal type of birthmark, but the presence of several cafe-au-lait spots larger than a quarter may occur in neurofibromatosis (a genetic disorder that causes abnormal cell growth of nerve tissues) and other conditions. What Causes Pigmented Birthmarks? The cause of pigmented birthmarks is not known. However, the amount and location of melanin (a substance that determines skin color) determines the color of pigmented birthmarks. What Are the Symptoms of Pigmented Birthmarks? Symptoms of pigmented birthmarks include skin that is abnormally dark or light, or bluish, brown, black or blue-gray in color. Discolorations of the skin may vary in size and can be smooth, flat, raised or wrinkled. Pigmented birthmarks may increase in size, change colors, become itchy, and may occasionally bleed. If  they do, they should be seen by a dermatologist as they may require a biopsy How Are Pigmented Birthmarks Diagnosed? In most cases, health care professionals can diagnose birthmarks based on the appearance of the skin. If a mole exhibits potentially cancerous changes, a biopsy may be performed. How Are Pigmented Birthmarks Treated? In most cases, no treatment is needed for the birthmarks themselves. When birthmarks do require treatment, however, that treatment varies based on the kind of birthmark and its related conditions. Large or prominent moles that affect appearance and self-esteem may be covered with special cosmetics . Moles can also be removed surgically. Warning Signs Since there is an increased risk of skin cancer in congenital nevi, see a doctor if you notice a change in color, size, or texture of a mole or other skin lesion. Also, see a doctor right away if there is any pain, bleeding, itching, inflammation, or ulceration of a congenital mole or other skin lesion. Can Pigmented Birthmarks Be Prevented? There is no known way to prevent birthmarks. People with birthmarks should use a good quality sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher when outdoors in order to prevent complications."
32,How to Stop Your Child From Biting,"You're enjoying a sunny afternoon on the playground when suddenly you spot your toddler with teeth embedded in a playmate's arm. Horrified, you rush to discipline your pint-sized vampire -- but what's the best way to handle the situation? Biting is a normal part of childhood development . Young children bite for many different reasons, from teething to seeing what reaction it will provoke. Many children between ages 1 and 3 go through a biting phase, which they eventually outgrow. Still, biting is something you want to discourage. Fortunately, there are ways to dissuade your little chomper from sinking their teeth into everything that walks and talks. Why Children Bite Kids bite for a number of reasons -- and most of them aren't intentionally malicious. They're in pain. When babies bite, typically it's because they're teething. They're just doing it to relieve the pain of their swollen, tender gums. They're exploring their world. Very young children use their mouths to explore, just as they use their hands. Just about everything infants or toddlers pick up eventually winds up in their mouths. Kids this age aren't yet able to prevent themselves from biting the object of their interest. They're looking for a reaction. Part of exploration is curiosity. Toddlers experiment to see what kind of reaction their actions will provoke. They'll bite down on a friend or sibling to hear the surprised exclamation, not realizing how painful the experience is for that person. They're craving attention. In older kids, biting is just one of several bad behaviors used to get attention. When a child feels ignored, discipline is at least one way of getting noticed -- even if the attention is negative rather than positive. They're frustrated. Biting, like hitting, is a way for some children to assert themselves when they're still too young to express feelings effectively through words. To your child, biting is a way to get back a favorite toy, tell you that they are unhappy, or let another child know that they want to be left alone. How to Stop Biting Practice prevention so that your child will be less likely to bite in the first place. If your baby is teething, make sure to always have a cool teething ring or washcloth on hand so they will be less likely to sink teeth into someone's arm. Avoid situations in which your child can get irritable enough to bite. Make sure that all of your child's needs -- including eating and nap time -- are taken care of before you go out to play. Bring along a snack to soothe your child if they get cranky from being hungry . As soon as your child is old enough, encourage the use of words (""I'm angry with you"" or ""That's my toy"") instead of biting. Other ways to express frustration or anger include hugging a stuffed animal or punching a pillow. Sometimes, shortening activities or giving your child a break can help prevent the rising frustration that can lead to biting and other bad behaviors. Give your child enough of your time throughout the day (for example, by reading or playing together), so they don't bite just to get attention. Extra attention is especially important when your child is going through a major life change, such as a move or welcoming a baby sibling. If your child is prone to biting, keep an eye on any playmates and step in when an altercation appears to be brewing. Even with your best prevention efforts, biting incidents might still occur. When your child bites, firmly let your child know that this behavior is not acceptable by saying, ""No. We don't bite!"" Explain that biting hurts the other person. Then remove your child from the situation and give the child time to calm down. You might have heard from other parents that if your child bites you, bite your child back. This isn't good advice. Children learn by imitation. If you bite your child, the child is going to get the impression that this behavior is acceptable and they will be more likely to do it again. The same goes for hitting a child for biting. If you are unable to get your child to stop biting, the behavior could begin to have an impact on school and relationships. You or another adult might have to closely supervise interactions between your child and other kids. When biting becomes a habit or continues past age 4 or 5, it might stem from a more serious emotional problem. Talk to your child's health care provider, or enlist the help of a child psychologist or therapist. Biting Injury Rx The first thing to do for any biting injury is to wash the area with soap and water. Even little teeth can break the skin . If the bite is bleeding and the wound appears to be deep, call your child's doctor. The bite may need medical treatment, which could include antibiotics or a tetanus shot, or both."
33,"Plague: Bubonic, Pneumonic, and Septicemic","What Is the Plague? Plague is an infectious disease that affects people and animals. Once called the Black Death, this disease that swept the world hundreds of years ago still lives. And it’s still dangerous. It's caused by bacteria called Yersinia pestis. It’s usually spread by fleas. These bugs pick up the germs when they bite infected animals like rats, mice, or squirrels. Then they pass it to the next animal or person they bite. You can also catch the plague directly from infected animals or people. Fortunately, we know more than our ancestors did about how to handle infectious diseases . These days, with quick treatment, the plague can be cured. Plague Basics Plague can cause swelling in your lymph nodes. The armpit is one of the common places for these bumps, called buboes, to appear. They also show up in the groin and neck. They're tender and painful. (Photo Credit: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/Science Source) Plague spreads easily among people, usually by droplets in the air that come out when infected people sneeze or cough. This can lead to epidemics. Thanks to treatment and prevention, the plague is rare now. Only a few thousand people around the world get it each year. Most of the cases are in Africa (especially the Democratic Republic of Congo and Madagascar), India, and Peru. The U.S. sees about seven cases a year, mostly in rural or remote areas in Southwestern states like Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and California. Plague History Scientists have found DNA signs of the plague in Bronze Age skeletons that are nearly 3,800 years old. The first plague pandemic, called the Justinian plague, struck in the years 541 and 542. Many waves of plague swept Europe and Asia from the 6th to 8th centuries. The second pandemic, the one known as the Black Death, arrived in Italy in 1347. Historians believe it started in Central Asia and came to Europe aboard trading ships, carried by fleas and rats. It spread quickly across Europe, and in the next 5 years, about a third of the continent's population died. This second pandemic ended around 1400, but Europe still had deadly outbreaks in the next 400 years. In the mid-1600s, plague in Italy killed two-thirds of the population of Naples and Genoa, and London lost roughly a quarter of its population. An outbreak in Moscow in 1770 killed about 100,000 people. The third plague pandemic started in southwest China in 1855. It spread from there, killing about 70,000 people in Canton. It reached Japan, Australia, and North and South America in the early 1900s. Experts estimate plague killed 12 million people in India in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Types of Plague There are three main types of plague . Bubonic plague This is usually caused by a flea bite. Within 2 to 8 days, your lymph nodes begin to swell as the bacteria builds up. These swollen glands are called ""buboes."" Septicemic plague It can be caused by a flea bite or by touching an animal that has plague. It can also develop from bubonic plague if it's not treated and the bacteria infects your blood. It's not clear how long it'll take you to start feeling sick, but it'll probably happen within days. Pneumonic plague This is the most serious type, and it's the only one that can spread from person to person. You can get it from breathing in droplets that come out when an infected person sneezes or coughs. It also can happen when you have bubonic or septicemic plague and the bacteria spreads to your lungs. It takes only 1 to 3 days to become sick. Symptoms of Plague After people catch the plague, the symptoms start 1-8 days later. You feel very sick and weak and may have a fever, chills, and headaches. Other symptoms depend on which of the three kinds of plague you have: Symptoms of bubonic plague This is the most common type. Aside from a fever, headache, and chills, the main symptom is buboes. Those swollen and painful lymph nodes can be under your arms, in your neck, or in your groin. Without treatment, the bacteria can spread to other parts of your body. Symptoms of septicemic plague This type is more dangerous than bubonic plague. Signs include: Bleeding under your skin or from your mouth, nose, or bottom Blackened skin, especially on your nose, fingers, and toes Belly pain, diarrhea, vomiting, and shock Symptoms of pneumonic plague This is the rarest form of the disease. It’s deadly without treatment. Symptoms include: Chest pain Cough ing , sometimes with blood Trouble breathing Nausea and vomiting Causes of Plague The bacteria that causes plague may live in certain animals without causing them to die. Scientists think that creates what they call a ""long-term reservoir,"" or supply, of the bacteria. Plague outbreaks can happen anywhere people come in contact with those reservoirs of bacteria. Some living conditions can make outbreaks of plague more likely. Cities that are overcrowded, lack systems for removing trash and human waste, and have large amounts of rats can be breeding grounds for plague. For most people, the chances of getting the plague are low. But it's more likely if you visit or live in an area with the plague and you: Touch a living or dead animal that might have been infected, like a rat, mouse, squirrel, rabbit, or chipmunk Work with animals regularly Spend a lot of time outdoors working, hiking, camping, or hunting Spend time with someone who has the plague Plague Diagnosis Your doctor might suspect you've been infected with plague if you have certain symptoms and live in an area where animals are known to carry it or have visited such a place recently. To find out if you have plague, your doctor will take samples from your body. Those could include blood or tissue from a swollen lymph gland. The samples are sent to a lab, which tests them for the bacteria that causes plague. In the past few years, researchers have come up with a rapid test that can spot signs of the plague bacteria within 15 minutes. It tests fluid from infected lymph nodes or that you cough up. It's not widely used, but it could be an important first test in parts of the world where it isn't as easy to get samples tested in a lab. Plague Treatment If you’ve been in an area with the plague and have symptoms, get to a doctor right away. Hours can make a difference. If you’ve been around someone who has the plague, your doctor may start treatment even if you don’t have symptoms. If you must be near the person, wear tight-fitting disposable surgical masks so you won’t breathe in the plague bacteria. If you have the plague, you'll be admitted to the hospital. You'll get antibiotics like: Ciprofloxacin (Cipro) Doxycycline (Vibramycin) Gentamicin (Garamycin) Levofloxacin (Levaquin) Treatment works well. With antibiotics, most people get better within a week or two. But without treatment, most people with the plague die. Plague Prevention There’s no vaccine for the plague in the U.S. So if you have a chance of contact with plague germs, take steps to protect yourself. If you travel to Africa, Asia, or South America, check for traveler notices about plague outbreaks on the CDC website. Avoid areas with the plague if you can, and stay away from sick or dead animals while you’re there. If you live in an area where there’s been a case of the plague: Fill holes and gaps in your home to stop mice, rats, and squirrels from getting in. Clean up your yard. Get rid of piles of leaves, wood, and rocks where animals might make their homes. Use bug repellent with DEET to prevent flea bites when you hike or camp. Wear gloves if you have to touch wild animals, alive or dead. Use flea control sprays or other treatments on your pets. Don’t let outdoor pets like cats or dogs sleep in your bed."
34,Understanding Black Eye,"What Is a Black Eye? A ''black eye'' is a bruise to the eyelid skin caused by blunt trauma to the eye region. It may also involve broken blood vessels in the white of the eye itself, called a subconjunctival hemorrhage. Like many bruises, a ""shiner"" is usually nothing to worry about and will disappear in 1-2 weeks. Most of the time, a black eye will clear up on its own. (Photo Credit: Bryan Steffy / Getty Images) In some cases, however, a black eye is a warning sign of more serious injury to the eye or to the skull. Any damage to the eyeball that causes it to become red and swollen must be promptly evaluated by a doctor or an eye specialist. Blunt force eye injuries, as occurs in fighting, competitive sports, and ordinary accidents, could involve an unsuspected detached retina , internal bleeding, or other serious problems. An orbital fracture involving one of the five delicate bones around the eye may trap an eye muscle or soft tissues. A fracture could also damage the optic nerve and permanently damage eyesight. If so, you may need emergency surgery to correct the condition. Black Eye Symptoms The signs of a black eye include bruising and swelling of the eyelid and soft tissue around the injured eye. The discoloration starts out deep purple or blue; then, it may turn green or yellow before disappearing, usually in about a week. If you also have a subconjunctival hemorrhage, all or part of the white of your eye will turn bright red. Usually, this isn't painful and clears up in about 2 weeks. What Causes a Black Eye? Most black eyes are the result of blunt trauma that causes bleeding beneath the thin eyelid skin, producing the characteristic black and blue discoloration. A fracture deep inside the skull can also blacken both eyes in what they call ""raccoon eyes"" although the eye area itself was not injured. People with sinusitis from allergies sometimes get ""allergic shiners""—darkening under the eyes caused by inflamed and engorged blood vessels—but this is not the same thing as a black eye, which is caused by an injury. When to See a Doctor for a Black Eye See a doctor for a black eye if: There was loss of consciousness as a result of the injury. Black eyes appear that affect one or both eyes after a head injury; you should be checked by a doctor for possible skull fracture. You have blurry or double vision . You can't move your eyeball in all directions. Any of the symptoms below may indicate damage to the eyeball, which should be evaluated and treated by an eye care specialist: Your eyeball hurts. You have an open cut around the eye. You have blurred vision, or see multiple images or floating spots or flashes of light. You are bleeding from the eye. You experience unusual sensitivity to light or other vision changes."
35,Black Hairy Tongue,"The name black hairy tongue may sound scary, but the condition is harmless. Black hairy tongue is caused by bacteria or fungi in the mouth, which make the tongue appear black and hairy. It's easily remedied by good old-fashioned oral hygiene. What Causes Black Hairy Tongue? A black hairy tongue is caused by too much bacteria or yeast growth in the mouth . The bacteria build up on tiny rounded projections called papillae. These lie along the surface of the tongue. Instead of shedding as they normally do, the papillae start to grow and lengthen, creating hair -like projections. They can grow to 15 times their normal length. Normally, the papillae are pinkish-white. But as they grow, pigments from food, drinks, and possibly the bacteria or yeast themselves get caught in the papillae, dyeing the tongue a color. Most often that color is black, hence the name. But the tongue can also turn brown, yellow, green, or a variety of other colors. Certain lifestyle habits and conditions can make people more likely to develop black hairy tongue. They include: poor oral hygiene smoking tobacco drinking a lot of coffee or tea using antibiotics (which may disrupt the normal balance of bacteria in the mouth ) being dehydrated taking medications that contain the chemical bismuth (such as Pepto-Bismol for upset stomach ) not producing enough saliva regularly using mouthwash that contains peroxide, witch hazel, or menthol getting radiation therapy to the head and neck Black hairy tongue is more common in men, people who use intravenous drugs, and those who are HIV-positive. What Are the Symptoms of Black Hairy Tongue? Other than the appearance of the tongue, most people with black hairy tongue don't have any symptoms or feel any discomfort. The exception is when there is too much growth of the yeast Candida albicans , which can cause a burning sensation on the tongue. This burning sensation is called glossopyrosis. Some people complain of a tickling feeling in the back of the roof of the mouth, a metallic taste in their mouth, or nausea . In more severe cases, the condition may lead to a gagging feeling. Sometimes, food getting caught inside the extra-long papillae can cause bad breath . How Is Black Hairy Tongue Treated? Practicing good oral hygiene is the best way to treat black hairy tongue. Gently brush your teeth twice a day with a soft toothbrush . Also, brush your tongue. You can use a tongue scraper to make sure you're thoroughly cleaning the area. Drink plenty of water throughout the day to help keep your mouth clean. Other tips include: If you smoke, quit. Add more roughage to your diet. Soft foods won't clean off the tongue effectively. Call your doctor or dentist if the problem doesn't get better on its own. Your doctor may prescribe antibiotics or an antifungal drug to get rid of the bacteria or yeast. Topical medications, such as tretinoin (Retin-A), are also sometimes prescribed. As a last resort, if the problem doesn't improve, the papillae can be surgically clipped off with a laser or electrosurgery."
36,Lung Diseases Overview,"Lung diseases are some of the most common medical conditions in the world. Tens of millions of people have lung disease in the U.S. alone. Smoking, infections, and genes cause most lung diseases. Your lungs are part of a complex system, expanding and relaxing thousands of times each day to bring in oxygen and send out carbon dioxide. Lung disease can happen when there are problems in any part of this system. Lung Diseases Affecting the Airways Your windpipe ( trachea ) branches into tubes called bronchi, which in turn become smaller tubes throughout your lungs. Diseases that can affect these airways include: Asthma. Your airways are constantly inflamed and may spasm, causing wheezing and shortness of breath. Allergies , infections, or pollution can trigger asthma symptoms. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ). With this lung condition, you can’t exhale the way you usually would, which causes trouble breathing. Chronic bronchitis. This form of COPD brings a long-term wet cough . Emphysema. Lung damage allows air to be trapped in your lungs in this form of COPD . Trouble blowing air out is its hallmark. Acute bronchitis. This sudden infection of your airways is usually caused by a virus. Cystic fibrosis. With this condition, you have trouble clearing mucus out of your bronchi. This leads to repeated lung infections. Lung Diseases Affecting the Air Sacs (Alveoli) Your airways branch into tiny tubes (bronchioles) that end in clusters of air sacs called alveoli. These air sacs make up most of your lung tissue. Lung diseases affecting your alveoli include: Pneumonia. An infection of your alveoli, usually by bacteria or viruses, including the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. Tuberculosis Pneumonia that slowly gets worse, caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis . Emphysema. This happens when the fragile links between alveoli are damaged. Smoking is the usual cause. (Emphysema also limits airflow, affecting your airways.) Pulmonary edema. Fluid leaks out of the small blood vessels of your lung into the air sacs and the area around them. One form is caused by heart failure and back pressure in your lungs' blood vessels. In another form, injury to your lung causes the leak of fluid. Lung cancer. It has many forms and may start in any part of your lungs. It most often happens in the main part of your lung, in or near the air sacs. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This is a severe, sudden injury to the lungs from a serious illness. COVID-19 is one example. Many people who have ARDS need help breathing from a machine called a ventilator until their lungs recover. Pneumoconiosis. This is a category of conditions caused by inhaling something that injures your lungs. Examples include black lung disease from coal dust and asbestosis from asbestos dust. Lung Diseases Affecting the Interstitium The interstitium is the thin, delicate lining between your alveoli. Tiny blood vessels run through the interstitium and let gas transfer between the alveoli and your blood. Various lung diseases affect the interstitium: Interstitial lung disease (ILD). This is a group of lung conditions that includes sarcoidosis , idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis , and autoimmune disease . Pneumonia and pulmonary edema can also affect your interstitium. Lung Diseases Affecting Blood Vessels The right side of your heart gets low-oxygen blood from your veins. It pumps blood into your lungs through the pulmonary arteries . These blood vessels can have diseases, as well. Pulmonary embolism (PE). A blood clot (usually in a deep leg vein, called deep vein thrombosis ) breaks off, travels to your heart , and gets pumped into your lungs. The clot sticks in a pulmonary artery, often causing shortness of breath and low blood oxygen levels. Pulmonary hypertension. Many conditions can cause high blood pressure in your pulmonary arteries. This can lead to shortness of breath and chest pain . If your doctor can’t find a cause, they’ll call it idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension . Lung Diseases Affecting the Pleura The pleura is the thin lining that surrounds your lung and lines the inside of your chest wall. A tiny layer of fluid lets the pleura on your lung's surface slide along the chest wall with each breath. Lung diseases of the pleura include: Pleural effusion. Fluid collects in the space between your lung and the chest wall. Pneumonia or heart failure usually causes this. Large pleural effusions can make it hard to breathe and may need to be drained. Pneumothorax. Air may get into the space between your chest wall and the lung, collapsing the lung. Mesothelioma. This is a rare form of cancer that forms on the pleura. Mesothelioma tends to happen several decades after you come into contact with asbestos. Lung Diseases Affecting the Chest Wall Your chest wall also plays an important role in breathing. Muscles connect your ribs to each other, helping your chest expand. Your diaphragm descends with each breath, also causing chest expansion. Diseases that affect your chest wall include: Obesity hypoventilation syndrome. Extra weight on your chest and belly can make it hard for your chest to expand. This may cause serious breathing problems . Neuromuscular disorders. You might have trouble breathing when the nerves that control your respiratory muscles don’t work the way they should. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and myasthenia gravis are examples of neuromuscular lung disease."
37,Black Widow Spider Bite,"The black widow is a medium-sized spider -- about a half-inch long. Two species are common to the United States: The southern black widow . This spider has a shiny, black, globe-shaped belly (abdomen). You’ll know it by the red hourglass mark on the underside. The northern black widow . You’ll notice a row of red spots down the middle of the upper surface of its abdomen. It also has two crosswise bars on the underside. Just to make things interesting, the markings can also be yellow or white. The spider may be brown or have red legs. These spiders are active at night. They prefer dark corners or crevices, like garages. They only bite when disturbed. The black widow spider produces a venom that affects the victim's nervous system. Some people are slightly affected by the venom, but others may have a serious response. Photo credit: iStock/Getty Images Symptoms of a Black Widow Spider Bite The black widow spider makes a venom that affects your nervous system . Some people are slightly affected by it, but others may have a serious response. You may feel serious pain, burning, swelling, and redness at the site. You may even see two fang marks. Other symptoms include: Muscles that begin to hurt and get stiff, usually within 8 hours Nausea or vomiting Trouble breathing Serious belly pain or cramping Heavy sweating Rash and itching Swollen eyelids Weakness or shaking You can't move your legs If you have serious symptoms like these, seek medical help right away. Many of the symptoms of a black widow bite can look like those of other conditions. But if you think you’ve been bitten by this spider, call your doctor or a poison control center right away. IMPORTANT: If you suspect your child was bitten by a black widow, get them to the emergency room. These bites can be fatal in young children as well as older people. In the meantime, you can try these tips to ease your symptoms and prevent further infection: Wash the area with soap and water. Apply a cold washcloth or ice pack wrapped in cloth to the area. Take an over-the-counter pain reliever like acetaminophen . If the bite is on your arm or leg, elevate it to prevent swelling. Apply an antibiotic cream or lotion to the bite. If possible, capture and kill the spider (place it in a plastic bag or jar) and take it to your doctor visit. This way, they’ll know for sure whether it was a black widow that bit you. the doctor will review your symptoms and decide what treatment, if any, you need. If your symptoms are serious, you may need muscle relaxants or stronger pain medicine. You might have to stay in the hospital, though that’s rarely the case. In the most serious cases, the doctor may inject you with antivenin. It’s a drug made from substances in the blood of horses. Antivenin neutralizes the black widow’s venom. That means it prevents it from causing you harm. Your doctor will only use this treatment after they've spoken with another doctor who has experience in treating these bites. Antivenin can cause a number of side effects, so if your doctor gives it to you, they’ll have to monitor you for about 8-12 days afterward. Prevention Black widow spiders live in cool, dark places like sheds and garages. They normally bite when they’re startled or surprised. To reduce your risk of being bitten, keep storage areas clean. And outside, try to avoid woodpiles, fallen tree branches, and other places they may hide."
38,If Your Child Gets a UTI,"Kids catch lots of bugs in their first few years of life. Colds and other respiratory infections are common. But kids can get urinary tract infections (UTIs), too. Up to 8% of girls and 2% of boys will get a UTI by age 5. Sometimes the symptoms of this infection can be hard to spot in kids. It's important to get your child treated, because a UTI can turn into a more serious kidney infection . With the right treatment, your child should start to feel better in just a few days. How Do Kids Get UTIs? It happens when bacteria from their skin or poop get into the urinary tract and multiply. These nasty germs can cause infections anywhere in the urinary tract, which is made up of the: Kidneys , which filter wastes and extra water out of the blood to make urine Ureters, which send urine from the kidneys into the bladder Bladder, which stores urine Urethra, which empties urine from the bladder out of the body A bladder infection is called cystitis. A kidney infection is called pyelonephritis. Girls are more likely to get UTIs than boys are because their urethra is shorter. Bacteria from the anus can more easily get into the vagina and urethra. Some kids have a problem with their bladder or kidneys that makes them more likely to get UTIs. Narrowing in the urinary tract can block urine flow and allow germs to multiply. A condition called vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) can cause urine to back up from the bladder into the ureters and kidneys. What Are the Signs and Symptoms? In older kids, the symptoms are often clear. The main symptoms are pain in the lower belly, back, or side or while peeing, and an urgent need to pee or pee more often. Some kids who already have been toilet trained lose control over their bladder and may wet the bed. You may even see drops of blood in the urine, and/or the urine is pink. With younger children, you might need to do a little digging to find out what's wrong. Infants can have more general symptoms, like fussiness, little interest in food, or a fever . Other symptoms of a UTI include: Burning or pain when your child pees Foul-smelling or cloudy pee An urgent need to go, and then only peeing a few drops Fever Nausea or vomiting Diarrhea How Is It Diagnosed? If your child has symptoms of a UTI, see your pediatrician. The doctor will take a urine sample and test it for blood, white blood cells, and other signs of infection. They can collect urine in a number of ways: Older children can pee into a cup (doctors call this a “clean catch”). Younger children who aren't toilet trained will have a plastic bag placed over their genitals to collect the urine. Children who wear diapers can have a tube (catheter) inserted into their urethra and bladder to collect the sample. In infants, the doctor can place a needle straight into the bladder through the stomach to get the sample. Rapid tests can be conducted to help your doctor find the exact germs that caused your child’s UTI so they’ll know the right type of medicine to prescribe to kill them. If your child has had a few UTIs, your doctor might refer you to a nephrologist (kidney specialist) and do one or more of these imaging tests to look for problems in the urinary tract: Ultrasound uses sound waves to show any blockages or other problems in the kidneys Voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) places fluid into the bladder through a tube to show any problems in the urethra or bladder when your child pees Nuclear scan uses liquids that contain a small amount of radioactive material to see how well the kidneys work CT, or computed tomography, is a powerful X-ray that makes detailed pictures of the bladder and kidneys MRI , or magnetic resonance imaging, uses powerful magnets and radio waves to make pictures of the bladder and kidneys What Are the Treatments for UTIs? Antibiotics , mainly. These medications kill bacteria. Kids usually take them for anywhere from 3 to 10 days (most commonly 7-10 days). Your doctor might do another urine test after your child finishes the medicine to see if the infection has cleared up. Make sure your child finishes all of their meds, even if they start to feel better. Stopping too soon can make germs resistant to antibiotics and cause another infection. Most UTIs clear up in about a week. Some kids will have symptoms for a few weeks. Call your doctor if your child's symptoms don't start to improve after 3 days from when they started on antibiotics, or if they get worse. How Can You Prevent UTIs in the Future? Change your baby's diapers often to prevent bacteria from growing. As your child gets older, teach them good bathroom habits to prevent UTIs. Instruct girls to wipe from front to back. This helps to prevent bacteria in poop from getting into the vagina and urinary tract. Encourage your kids to go to the bathroom as soon as they feel the urge -- not to hold it in. Girls should avoid bubble baths and should not use perfumed soaps. And, they should wear cotton underwear -- not nylon -- to improve airflow and prevent bacteria from growing. Have your kids drink lots of water , which helps flush bacteria out of the urinary tract. Extra water also prevents constipation , which can create blockages in the urinary tract that allow bacteria to grow."
39,What Are Bladder Infections?,"Bladder infections have a way of getting your attention. You make countless trips to the bathroom, and still you feel like you have to go again. And once you’re in there, instead of mindlessly going about your business, you feel burning or stinging every time you pee. When you get a bladder infection, it leads to cystitis, which is when your bladder swells and gets irritated. That’s what causes the symptoms. A bladder infection is the most common type of urinary tract infection ( UTI ). Here are the parts of your urinary tract and what they do: Your kidneys clean waste from your blood and make pee. Your ureters are thin tubes that carry urine from each kidney to your bladder. Your bladder stores pee. Your urethra carries pee from the bladder to the outside of your body. Women get bladder infections more often than men do. Usually, the infections are more annoying than they are serious and can be treated with antibiotics . Sometimes a bladder infection can travel up the ureters to the kidneys and cause an infection there. This is why it's important to treat these infections right away Causes The main culprits are bacteria, usually E. coli . These bacteria live on your skin and in your intestines and most of the time, they’re not a problem. Everyone has them. But if they get into the urethra, they can end up in the bladder and cause an infection. Bladder infections are more common in women than men for several reasons. A woman’s urethra is shorter than a man’s, and it’s close to the vagina and anus , where bacteria live. Having sex , wiping from back to front after you go to the bathroom, putting in a tampon, and using a diaphragm for birth control are some of the ways bacteria can get in. During pregnancy , the baby can press on your bladder, which prevents it from emptying completely and gives bacteria a place to thrive. After menopause , women have less of the hormone estrogen. That causes the lining of the urethra to get thinner and may change the balance of bacteria in the vagina , making infections more likely. When men get them, a prostate infection usually is the cause. But any blockage -- like from a bladder stone or enlarged prostate -- can prevent the bladder from totally emptying and cause infection."
40,Head Injury,"Head injuries are damage to the scalp, skull, or brain caused by trauma. When it affects the brain, they’re called  a traumatic brain injury, or TBI. To most people, head injuries are considered an acceptable risk when engaging in sports and other types of recreational activities. But they’re dangerous. They can lead to permanent disability, mental impairment, and even death. There are steps you can take to lower the risk and protect yourself and your children. Types of Head Injuries There are many different types of head injuries. Concussion. This is the most common type of head injury. A concussion is a type of traumatic brain injury (TBI) that happens when the brain is jarred or shaken hard enough to bounce against the skull. It can range from mild to severe. You don't have to be hit in the head to get a concussion. An impact elsewhere on the body can create enough force to jar the brain. Contusion . A bruise on the actual brain itself is called a contusion. It can cause bleeding and swelling. Intracranial hematoma (ICH) . This is bleeding under the skull in the brain that forms a clot. Brain hematomas range from mild to severe and are grouped according to where they form. Skull fracture . Sometimes, a broken skull bone can affect the brain. The broken pieces of bone can cut into the brain and cause bleeding and other types of injury. Head Injury Causes The most common causes of head injuries are: Car or motorcycle accidents Falls Child abuse Acts of violence A concussion or other head injury can also happen when two athletes collide or a player is hit in the head with a piece of sporting equipment. In soccer, even ""heading"" the ball can cause a concussion. Among the sports-related activities that cause the highest number of head injuries for all ages: Cycling Football Basketball Baseball and softball Riding powered recreational vehicles such as dune buggies, go-karts, and mini bikes According to the Brain Injury Association of America, the five leading activities that cause  concussions in children and adolescents aged 5-18 years of age are: Cycling Football Basketball Playground activities Soccer Sports activities and trauma aren’t always the cause of head injuries. Contusions or brain hemorrhages can have other causes, such as: Long-term high blood pressure (in adults) Bleeding disorders Use of blood thinners or certain recreational drugs Head Injury Signs and Symptoms Signs and symptoms of a concussion may show up immediately, or they can take hours or even days to show up. You don’t always lose consciousness with a concussion. A concussion causes changes in a person's mental status and can disrupt the normal functioning of the brain. Multiple concussions can have a long-lasting, life-changing effect. Signs of a TBI, like a concussion, include: Confusion Depression Dizziness or balance problems Double or fuzzy vision Feeling foggy or groggy Feeling sluggish or tired Headache Memory loss Nausea Sensitivity to light or noise Sleep disturbance Trouble concentrating Trouble remembering Signs or symptoms that a head injury may be more than a concussion and requires emergency treatment include: Changes in size of pupils Clear or bloody fluid draining from the nose, mouth , or ears Convulsions Distorted facial features Facial bruising Fracture in the skull or face Impaired hearing, smell, taste, or vision Inability to move one or more limbs Irritability Lightheadedness Loss of consciousness Low breathing rate Restlessness, clumsiness, or lack of coordination Severe headache Slurred speech or blurred vision Stiff neck or vomiting Sudden worsening of symptoms after initial improvement Swelling at the site of the injury Persistent vomiting Head Injury Treatment If you think you may have a concussion or suspect that someone else has one, the most important step to take is to prevent further injury. Stop whatever activity you are involved in and tell someone you think you may have been injured. Then get medical attention. If you're playing as part of a team, ask to be taken out of the game and tell the coach what happened. If a fellow player has signs of being confused or a sudden loss of coordination, be sure to report this to a coach. If you are coaching a team and you notice a potential injury, take the person out of the game, and see that the person gets medical care. Receiving medical attention as soon as possible is important for any type of potentially moderate to severe TBI. Undiagnosed injuries that don't receive proper care can cause long-term disability and impairment. Keep in mind that although death from a sports injury is rare, brain injuries are the leading cause of sports-related deaths. Symptoms should be closely monitored often with a moderate to severe injury. It may require an overnight stay in the hospital. A doctor may take X-rays to check for potential skull fracture and stability of the spine. In some cases the doctor may ask for a CT scan or an MRI to check on the extent of the damage that occurred. More severe injuries may need surgery to relieve pressure from swelling. If a child sustains a head injury, don’t automatically have them X-rayed. Monitor them carefully for age appropriate symptoms of a TBI such as confusion or behavioral change. Don’t give them medications, including aspirin, without advice from your doctors. If the doctor sends you home with an injured person, they may instruct you to watch that person closely. That may involve waking the person every few hours to ask questions such as ""What's your name?"" or ""Where are you?"" to be sure the person is OK. Be sure you've asked the doctor and understand what symptoms to watch for and which ones require immediate attention. Guidelines urge doctors not allow someone who has been injured to return to activity that involves risk of further injury until completely free of symptoms. Most teens recover within two weeks, while it may take younger children up to four weeks to recover. But symptoms of severe injury could persist for months or even years. A person with a moderate to serious injury will likely require rehabilitation that may include physical and occupational therapy , speech and language therapy, medication , psychological counseling, and social support. Head Injury Risk Prevention The most important step to take is to buy and properly use protective head gear that has been approved by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM). Be sure to buy the right size for a proper fit and to wear the helmet or headgear properly. According to the American Association of Neurological Surgeons, helmets or headgear should be worn at all times for the following activities: Baseball and softball Cycling Football Hockey Horseback riding Riding powered recreational vehicles Skateboarding and riding scooters Skiing Snowboarding Wrestling In addition, the FDA has approved the noninvasive device, called Q-Collar which can be worn by athletes to help prevent head injuries. The C-shaped collar applies compressive force to the neck and increases blood volume to help reduce movement of the brain, which may occur because of hits to the head. The device may reduce specific changes in the brain that are associated with brain injury. Other things you can do to keep yourself and your kids safer: Wear light-reflecting clothes when riding a bike at night. Don't dive in water less than 12 feet deep or any body of water where you cannot see the bottom, murky water. Make sure that children's play areas and equipment are safe and in good repair. Don't let children play sports that are inappropriate for their age. Supervise and teach children how to properly use sports equipment. Don't wear clothing that interferes with vision . Follow all rules at water parks and swimming pools. Don't skateboard or cycle on uneven or unpaved surfaces. Don't play sports when you are tired or very ill."
41,Blepharitis,"What Is Blepharitis? Blepharitis is inflammation of the oil glands in your eyelids. It’s the most common cause of dry eyes . Blepharitis Symptoms The condition makes your eyelids red, itchy, and a little swollen. The bases of your eyelashes may look scaly. You might also notice: Feeling like something is in your eye A burning feeling in your eye Sensitivity to light Blurry vision Dry eyes Red eyes Watery eyes Crusty eyelashes when you wake up in the morning Blepharitis Causes Things that cause blepharitis include: Excess bacteria A blocked oil gland on your eyelid Hormone problems Allergies Infection with a virus Skin conditions such as seborrheic dermatitis , rosacea , and eczema Tiny insects called mites Blepharitis Diagnosis Your doctor will ask about your symptoms. They might also: Look closely at your eyelids, your eyelashes , and the texture of your skin Use a magnifying device to look at the edges of your eyelids and the openings of the glands there Check that your eyes are making enough tears Take a sample of material from your eyelids to check for bacteria Blepharitis Treatment There’s no cure for blepharitis. But you might be able to manage and treat it by taking care of your eyelids. Warm compresses can help soften crust and loosen oily debris. Follow these steps: Wet a clean washcloth in warm (not hot) water . Wring it out and place it over your closed eyelids for 5 minutes. Wet it again as necessary to keep it warm. Keeping your eyelids clean may also ease symptoms: Make a solution that’s half baby shampoo and half water . Put a clean cloth over your index finger and dip it into the mix. Close one eye . Gently rub the washcloth over your eyelashes and the edge of your lids for about 30 seconds to loosen clogged oil. Apply light pressure along your eyelashes to squeeze out clogged oils from the glands behind your lashes. Rinse thoroughly with a clean, warm, wet washcloth. Pat dry. Then do the other eye. Depending on the cause of your blepharitis, your doctor might recommend: Artificial tears Antibiotics , either as an ointment, drops, or a spray for your eyes, or as pills that you swallow Antiviral drugs Plugs that block your tear ducts in order to keep more tears in your eyes Other medications, such as glucocorticoids or cyclosporine Researchers are still studying other treatments involving pulsed light or heat. Blepharitis Complications The inflammation of blepharitis can lead to complications such as: Loss of eyelashes Excess tears Dry eyes, possibly raising your chances of a cornea infection Clogged glands that might get infected ( stye ) or form a lump ( chalazion ) Scarring on your eyelids Cornea inflammation Blepharitis Prevention A few lifestyle changes might help keep blepharitis away. Keep your eyelids clean. Remove all eye makeup before bed. Don’t use eyeliner on the back edges of your eyelids, behind the lashes. If you’re in the early stages of treating blepharitis, prevent further irritation by not using makeup . Once you start to use it again, replace products that you use in or near your eyelids. They may be contaminated."
42,Blisters: What You Should Know,"Whether your shoes are too tight or you touched a hot stove, the result is all too familiar: a painful pocket of skin that's filled with fluid. A single blister like that is usually easy to treat at home, but if you see signs of infection, it's time to call your doctor. What Causes Blisters? Friction. You can get blisters when something rubs against your skin, like a tool handle or a new pair of shoes. Unlike corns and calluses, which show up after rubbing that's gone on for a long time, friction blisters come from brief, intense contact on a small area. Burns . You can get a blister from getting too close to a flame or steam, or if you touch a hot surface. A severe sunburn can also cause blisters. Cold. An extremely low temperature on your skin can cause blisters. For example, you might get one if your doctor freezes off a wart . Irritants or allergy triggers . Your skin may blister if you come in contact with certain chemicals, cosmetics , and many plant allergens. You may hear your doctor call this problem irritant or allergic contact dermatitis . Drug reactions . Sometimes your blisters may be a reaction to a drug you take. When your doctor prescribes a new medicine, always let them know about any drug reactions you've had in the past. Call your doctor if you get a blister after taking a medication . Autoimmune diseases . Three diseases that curb your immune system -- your body's defense against germs -- can cause blisters: Pemphigus vulgaris, a possibly life-threatening skin disease, causes painful blisters in the mouth or skin. They become raw and crusted over after they burst. Bullous pemphigoid causes less severe blisters that heal faster and are not life-threatening. It mostly happens in elderly people. Dermatitis herpetiformis causes small, itchy blisters. It's a long-term condition that usually starts when you're a young adult. It's linked to gluten sensitivity. Infection . Blisters are a common symptom of conditions like chickenpox , cold sores , shingles , and a skin infection called impetigo . Genes .There are rare genetic diseases that cause the skin to be fragile and to blister. How to Treat Your Blisters If you leave your blister alone, it often gets better in 1 or 2 weeks. While it's healing, stay away from the activity that brought on the blister. Some steps you can take to help the healing process: Put on a bandage. It protects your blister while it heals. Keep it padded. If your blister rubs up against your shoe, you can stop it from getting worse by using padding underneath the bandage. Usually, there's no need to drain your blister, but you may want to if it's large and hurts a lot. If you decide to do it, use a small needle that you've sterilized with rubbing alcohol. Then pierce the edge of the blister. Afterward, wash the spot with rubbing alcohol and cover it with an antibiotic ointment. When to Call Your Doctor Be on the lookout for signs that your blister is infected. Call your doctor if it gets more painful or you notice: Pus leaking out Swelling Redness"
43,What Are Blocked Tear Ducts?,"You need tears for a lot more than crying. They flow across the surface of your eyes to clean and moisten them, then they leave your eyes through a system of tiny drainage tubes that run along your nose. Sometimes these tubes can get narrowed or blocked, which prevents the tears from draining out of your eyes . This extra fluid can leave your eyes watery. If your eyes are watery and irritated, get them checked to find out whether it’s a blocked tear duct . If it is, your eye doctor has things they can do to open up the blockage and help your tears flow normally again. If the portion of the tear duct in the bone of the nose is blocked, it can cause a serious infection of the tear sac called dacryocystitis. What Are Tear Ducts? Tear ducts are like tiny tunnels that your tears pass through. They’re part of the drainage system that goes from your eyes to your throat. Glands inside your eyelids and the white part of your eyes constantly release tears into your eyes. As you blink, they drain out. They exit through two small holes called puncta in the upper and lower inside corners of your eyelids, next to your nose. Causes of Blockage Sometimes babies are born with blocked tear ducts. This happens because a piece of tissue that covers the duct doesn't open up at birth like it should. It will usually open on its own within a few months. Less often, tear ducts get blocked because the tear drainage system didn't form correctly in the womb. In adults, tear ducts can get blocked for lots of reasons: The holes in the corners of the eyes, the puncta, narrow due to age. Trauma cuts the drainage duct. Harmless debris or small particles get stuck in the duct. A broken nose or other injury leaves scar tissue that presses on the tear duct. Small, rounded growths called polyps form in the nose and block the duct. An infection in the eye or nose causes swelling around the tear duct. Conjunctivitis ( pinkeye ), an infection of the conjunctiva, the clear membrane that covers the eye, is one common infection that can cause blocked tear ducts. A tumor presses on the drainage system. Sinus surgery damages the tear ducts or the holes that drain to them. Eye drops to treat glaucoma make the conjunctiva and the tear ducts swell. Radioactive iodine and chemotherapy treatment for cancer cause swelling in the tear ducts. Treatments There are different ways to open a blocked tear duct. They range from massage to procedures that remove the blockage. Massage . Rubbing the corners of your, or your baby's, eyes twice a day can release fluid and open up the tissue that covers the tear ducts. Tear duct probing. If a tear duct doesn't open on its own by your baby's first birthday, the doctor can place a thin probe into the puncta to open the tissue covering the duct. Balloon catheter dilation. The doctor threads a thin tube called a catheter into the tear duct. A pump inflates a balloon at the end of the tube to widen the duct. Intubation. A tiny tube is threaded through the tear ducts to the inside of the nose. The tubes stay in place for 3 to 6 months to open up the ducts and let tears drain. Surgery. Dacryocystorhinostomy is a type of surgery to bypass the blocked tear duct in adults who haven't gotten better with other treatments. It creates a new route for tears to drain from the eye."
44,Blood Transfusion: What to Know If You Get One,"A blood transfusion is a way of adding blood to your body after an illness or injury. If your body is missing one or more of the components that make up healthy blood , a transfusion can help supply what your body is missing. Depending on how much blood you need, a transfusion can take between 1 and 4 hours. About 5 million Americans need a blood transfusion every year, and the procedure is usually safe. What Happens During a Blood Transfusion? Your blood is made up of several different parts including red and white cells, plasma, and platelets. “Whole blood” refers to blood that has all of them. In some cases, you may need to have a transfusion that uses whole blood, but it’s more likely that you’ll need a specific component. Why Would You Need a Blood Transfusion? There are many reasons you might need to receive a blood transfusion. These are just a few of them: You’ve had major surgery or a serious injury and you need to replace lost blood You’ve experienced bleeding in your digestive tract from an ulcer or other condition You have an illness like leukemia or kidney disease that causes anemia (not enough healthy red blood cells) You’ve received cancer treatments like radiation or chemotherapy You have a blood disorder or severe liver problems Blood Types When you get a transfusion, the blood you’re given has to work with the type of blood you have (either A, B, AB, or O). Otherwise, antibodies in your own blood will attack it, and cause problems. That’s why blood banks screen for blood type , Rh-factor (positive or negative), as well as anything that can cause infection. About 40% of people have type O blood, which is safe to give almost anyone in a transfusion. If you have type O blood, you’re called a universal donor. If you have type AB blood, you can receive any type of blood and you’re called a universal recipient. If you have Rh-negative blood, you can only receive Rh-negative blood. Types of Blood Transfusions There are several common kinds of blood cell transfusions: A red blood cell transfusion may be used if you have anemia or an iron deficiency . Platelets are tiny cells in the blood that help you stop bleeding. A platelet transfusion is used if your body doesn’t have enough of them, possibly because of cancer or cancer treatments. A plasma transfusion helps replace the proteins in your blood that help it clot. It may be needed after severe bleeding or if you have liver disease. During the Transfusion You’ll likely go to your doctor’s office or a hospital to receive your blood transfusion. The new blood will be given to you through a needle and an IV line. You’ll be monitored in case there are any problems. Risks and Complications In general, blood transfusions are considered safe, but there are risks. Sometimes complications show up immediately, others take some time. Fever : It’s usually not considered serious if you get a fever 1 to 6 hours after your transfusion. But if you also feel nauseated or have chest pain , it could be something more serious. See your doctor right away. Allergic reactions: It’s possible to experience an allergic reaction to the blood you receive, even if it’s the correct blood type. If this happens, you’ll likely feel itchy and develop hives . If you have an allergic reaction , it’s likely to happen during the transfusion or very shortly after. Acute immune hemolytic reaction : This complication is rare, but is a medical emergency. It happens if your body attacks the red blood cells in the blood you’ve received. This normally takes place during or right after your transfusion, and you’ll experience symptoms like fever, chills, nausea , or pain in your chest or lower back. Your urine might also come out dark. Delayed hemolytic reaction: This is similar to an acute immune hemolytic reaction, but it happens more gradually. Anaphylactic reaction: This happens within minutes of starting a transfusion and may be life-threatening. You may experience swelling of the face and throat, shortness of breath, and low blood pressure . Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI): This is a rare, but potentially fatal reaction. It shows up within hours of the start of the transfusion in the form of a fever and low blood pressure. TRALI damages your lungs . It may be caused by antibodies or other substances in the new blood. Even though it’s rare, it’s still the leading cause of transfusion-related death in the United States. Bloodborne Infections: Blood banks thoroughly screen donors and test donated blood for viruses, bacteria, and parasites , but infections are still a rare possibility. HIV : Your chance of contracting HIV through donated blood is 1 in 2 million (a lower risk than being struck by lightning). Hepatitis B and C: Your chance of contracting hepatitis B is about 1 in 300,000 and your risk of contracting hepatitis C is about 1 in 1.5 million. West Nile virus : Your chance of contracting West Nile virus is about 1 in 350,000. Zika virus : In 2016, the FDA began recommending that blood centers screen for Zika. Most people who have it don’t show any symptoms. Hemochromatosis (iron overload): You can get too much iron in your blood if you have multiple blood transfusions. This can damage your heart and liver . Graft -versus-host disease: This complication is extremely rare, but is usually fatal. It happens when the white blood cells in the new blood attack your bone marrow. You may be more likely to experience this complication if you have a weakened immune system ."
45,Piercing,"Are you thinking about getting an ear or body piercing? Here are some key questions to ask yourself before you get pierced: Do you have your parents' permission? Most places require you to have parental consent if you are under age 18. So be sure to check with your parents before getting pierced. What does your school say ? Some schools don't allow students to have facial piercings. Are you looking for a job? Some jobs don't allow employees to have facial piercings. Make sure the piercing is appropriate for your daily life. Are you thinking of donating blood? Some organizations don't accept blood from people who have been pierced within the last year. Are you up to date with your vaccines? It's a good idea to make sure you're vaccinated for diseases such as hepatitis B and tetanus before you get a piercing. Is piercing safe? When done in a clean and professional environment, piercing is usually safe. But if piercing equipment is unclean, there is a risk of getting blood-transmitted diseases. These include: Hepatitis B Hepatitis C Tetanus HIV Even in a sterile (germ-free) environment, some common risks of piercing are: Chronic infection Skin allergies Abscesses (pus-filled, painful areas of skin) Inflammation or nerve damage Prolonged bleeding In general, it's a good idea to talk to your doctor before a piercing if you: Have diabetes Have a heart condition Have a weakened immune system Are pregnant Take herbal supplements Where should I go to get my piercing done? A sterile environment is the most important thing to consider when deciding where to go to get pierced. Here are some tips for finding a safe place to get your piercing done: Check with your doctor. Some doctors' offices will do basic ear piercings. Research piercing shops that use safe procedures or are licensed by the state. If you are going to a stand in a mall, make sure employees use a sterile, single-use piercing gun. NEVER do this: Pierce yourself or have a friend pierce you. Get pierced in a shop that looks unclean, makes you uncomfortable, or doesn't answer all your questions. How do I know that my piercing shop is safe and sterile? Many states regulate body piercing, but not all. Before getting your piercing, you should always check for these signs of a safe piercing environment: The piercer washes their hands with germicidal soap. The piercer wears fresh disposable gloves. The shop is clean. The shop uses an autoclave (a special sterilizing machine). The equipment is sterilized or disposable. The needle is new and disposed of in a special container after use. Should I get pierced with a piercing gun or a needle? Needles are generally considered cleaner and easier to sterilize than piercing guns. Your piercer should only use a piercing gun that is for one-time use or has sterilized disposable cassettes. Piercing guns should only be used on earlobe piercings. That's because they can cause more damage to the skin tissue than needles. How long will it take for my piercing to heal? Healing times can vary depending on the location of the piercing. Here are the average healing times for common piercings: Earlobe: 6 to 8 weeks Ear cartilage: 4 months to 1 year Eyebrow: 6 to 8 weeks Nostril: 2 to 4 months Nasal septum: 6 to 8 months Tongue: 4 weeks Lip: 2 to 3 months Belly button: 4 months to 1 year Remember, with mouth or lip piercing, jewelry can cause cracks in your teeth or receding gums. Lip piercings and mouth piercings can get infected more easily. How can I care for my new piercing? Your piercer will give you specific instructions for cleaning your piercing. Here are some general dos and don'ts for new piercings: Do: Wash your hands before cleaning the piercing. Clean the pierced area with antibacterial soap or hypochlorous acid.. Soak the piercing in salt water. This will cleanse it and loosen crusty formations. Rinse with an alcohol-free, antibacterial mouthwash or hypochlorous acid.(for tongue and lip piercings). Use a topical antibiotic. Don't: Pick at or touch the piercing. This can irritate it and lead to infection. Use alcohol or hydrogen peroxide to clean the piercing. This can dry out your skin and break down new tissue. Use public pools or hot tubs while the piercing is healing. Wear makeup during the healing process (for ear or facial piercings). Wear tight clothes (for body piercings). What happens if my piercing becomes infected? Some temporary pain or swelling is normal after a piercing. But if pain continues, it could mean an infection. Be extra careful if you get an oral piercing. These are more susceptible to infection because of bacteria in the mouth. Contact with jewelry against the teeth can also cause your teeth to crack or chip. Watch out for these signs of infection: Pain that does not go away after a day or two Unusual pain or swelling Yellow, bad-smelling discharge Prolonged bleeding Excessive redness If you think your piercing may be infected: Don't take out the jewelry. This will cause the hole to close up and may trap the infection. See your doctor for treatment. What if I am sensitive to metal? Some people have sensitivities to certain kinds of metal jewelry. Signs you could be allergic to your new piercing include: Redness Itching or burning when piercing is cleaned Rash surrounding the piercing To avoid an allergic reaction, use only nontoxic metals, such as: Surgical-grade steel 14- or 18-karat gold Titanium Niobium Platinum"
46,Bone Spurs,"What Are Bone Spurs? Bone spurs (also called osteophytes) are smooth, hard bumps of extra bone that form on the ends of bones. They often pop up in the joints -- the places where two bones meet. Bone spurs can form on many parts of your body, including your: Hands Shoulders Neck Spine Hips Knees Feet (heels) Most bone spurs don't cause problems. But if they rub against other bones or press on nerves, you might experience pain and stiffness. Causes of Bone Spurs The most common cause of bone spurs is joint damage from osteoarthritis or degenerative joint disease. The cushioning between your joints and the bones of your spine can wear down with age. Rheumatoid arthritis , lupus, and gout can also damage your joints. Bone spurs also often form after an injury to a joint or tendon. When your body thinks your bone is damaged, it tries to fix it by adding bone to the injured area. Other causes of bone spurs include: Overuse – for example, if you run or dance a lot over a long period of time Genes Diet Obesity Bone problems that you were born with Narrowing of the spine ( spinal stenosis ) Symptoms of Bone Spurs You might not realize you have a bone spur until you get an X-ray to look for another condition. They only cause problems when they press on nerves, tendons, or other structures in your body. Then, you might feel any of the following: Pain in the affected joint Pain or stiffness when you try to bend or move the affected joint Weakness, numbness , or tingling in your arms or legs if the bone spur presses on nerves in your spine Muscle spasms, cramps, or weakness Bumps under your skin, seen mainly in the hands and fingers Trouble controlling your bladder or bowels if the bone spur presses on certain nerves in your spine (a symptom that's seen very rarely) Your symptoms might get worse when you exercise or try to move the affected joint. A bone spur can break off and get stuck in the lining of the joint. This is called a ""loose body."" It can lock up the joint and make it hard to move. Bone Spur Diagnosis Often, bone spurs are first evaluated by your regular doctor who will likely refer you to a specialist. You’ll probably need to see a rheumatologist or orthopedic doctor . Rheumatologists specialize in joint problems. Orthopedic doctors focus on the musculoskeletal system. Your doctor will feel the joint to check for a bump. They may also order an X-ray to help them to see the bone spur better. Other tests your doctor can use to diagnose bone spurs include: CT scan. It's a powerful X-ray that makes detailed pictures inside your body. MRI. This uses powerful magnets and radio waves to make pictures of organs and structures inside your body. Electroconductive tests. These tests measure how fast your nerves send electrical signals. They can show the damage bone spurs have caused to nerves in your spinal canal. Bone Spur Treatments and Home Care To relieve pain and bring down swelling, you can try one of these over-the-counter pain relievers: Acetaminophen (Tylenol) Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) Naproxen sodium (Aleve) These can cause side effects, especially if you take them in large doses or for a long time. If you've taken them for more than a month, ask your doctor if you can try a different treatment. Other therapies for bone spurs include: Rest Steroid shots to bring down swelling and reduce pain in the joints Physical therapy to improve joint strength and increase movement If these treatments don't work or the bone spur affects your movement, you might need surgery to remove the extra bone. Bone Spur Prevention Bone spurs usually can’t be prevented if they’re the result of the natural wear and tear of arthritis. But you can take these steps to avoid bone spurs caused by other things: Wear shoes with a wide toe box, good arch support, and enough cushion to pad each step. Get your shoes fitted by a professional so they don't rub against your feet when you walk. Wear thick socks to prevent your shoes from rubbing. Eat a well-rounded diet with plenty of calcium and vitamin D to protect your bones. Do regular weight-bearing exercises like walking or stair climbing to keep your bones strong. Try to keep the extra pounds off. See your doctor if you have any signs of joint trouble, like pain, swelling, or stiffness. If you catch and treat arthritis early, you may be able to prevent the damage that leads to bone spurs."
47,Understanding Colorectal Cancer -- The Basics,"What Is Colorectal Cancer? Inside your abdominal cavity is the long, tubular digestive tract. The second part of this tube -- the large intestine -- is composed of the colon , which stretches 4 feet to 6 feet, and the rectum, which is only 4 inches to 6 inches long. The inner lining of this ""colorectal tube"" can be a fertile breeding ground for small tumors, called polyps (Figure 1). About a quarter of all adults in the U.S. older than age 50 will have at least one colorectal polyp. Most colorectal cancers develop from polyps in glandular tissue of the intestinal lining. Most polyps are benign, but at least one type is known to be precancerous. These are called adenomatous polyps. The size of the polyp correlates with the development of cancer . Polyps less than 1 centimeter in size have a slightly greater than a 1% chance of becoming cancer , but those 2 centimeters or greater have a 40% chance of transforming into cancer . Overall, the incidence is about 5%. Most colorectal cancers develop from polyps in glandular tissue of the intestinal lining. If colorectal cancer is diagnosed and treated early while the tumor is still localized, the disease is highly curable, with five-year survival rates of about 90%. If the tumor continues to grow, cancer can spread directly through the bowel wall to surrounding lymph nodes, tissues, and organs, as well as into the bloodstream. Once the cancer spreads to lymph nodes or other organs, successful treatment becomes more difficult. Depending on how advanced the disease is, five-year survival rates range from 11% to 87%. Cancers of the colon and rectum are common, with approximately 135,000 cases diagnosed each year. Like many cancers, colorectal cancer is of particular concern for people older than age 50. Although diagnosis is often possible at an early stage, many people delay seeking medical care because they are embarrassed or fearful of symptoms related to their bowels. Risk increases significantly after age 50 and continues to increase with age. What Causes Colorectal Cancer? The exact cause of colorectal cancer is not known. But there are several risk factors for the disease. Other diseases . Colorectal cancer is strongly associated with certain other diseases. Those people considered at high risk include anyone with a personal or family history of colon polyps or colon cancer, inflammatory disease of the colon such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease , and cancers of the pancreas , breast , ovaries, or uterus. Heredity . As with any cancer, susceptibility to colorectal cancer is at least partly determined by genetic makeup . A few people inherit medical conditions, such as familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), MYH-associated polyposis (MAP), Gardner's syndrome, Turcot's syndrome, Peutz-Jagher's syndrome, juvenile polyposis, and Cowden's disease. In all of these disorders, colon polyps develop at an early age, and unless treated, these people are at high risk of developing colorectal cancer. Hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer . The disease extends from generation to generation and causes a person to develop colon cancer. This disease is associated with other cancers including endometrial, ovarian, stomach, small intestine, pancreas, kidney, ureter, brain, and bile duct. Diet . Diet also contributes to the risk of colorectal cancer, although the cause-and-effect relationship is still unclear. People whose diets are high in fruits and vegetables seem to have a reduced risk. Many studies implicate animal fat and protein as promoters of colorectal cancer, although researchers are cautious about drawing any definite conclusions. Some studies show that regularly eating red meat, which is rich in saturated fat and protein, increases risk, while others find no connection. Some scientists note that fat is the main culprit, while others suspect protein. Others contend that it's not the fat and protein themselves, but the way they are cooked. They note that fats and protein cooked at high temperatures -- especially when broiled and barbecued -- can produce a host of potentially carcinogenic substances linked to colorectal cancer. Chemical exposure . Heavy exposure to certain chemicals, including chlorine -- which in small amounts is commonly used to purify drinking water -- may increase the risk of colorectal cancer. Exposure to asbestos is thought to be potentially harmful because it has been implicated in causing formation of polyps in the colon. History of certain types of surgery. Surgeries such as ureterosigmoidostomy, which is performed in the treatment of bladder cancer , and a cholecsytecomy (the removal of the gallbladder ). Some studies show surgery of the bladder may lead to a risk for colon cancer development, but other studies do not. History of colon cancer. A prior case of colon cancer increases the risk of a second colon cancer, especially if the first cancer was diagnosed before the age of 60. Lifestyle. Smoking and alcohol intake of more than 4 drinks per week increases the risk of developing colon cancer. Family history . Those with a first-degree relative with colorectal cancer have an increased risk of the disease. The risk increases if more than one first-degree relative has colon cancer. Radiation . Prior radiation increases the risk of cancer to the radiated tissue only."
48,What Is Borderline Personality Disorder?,"Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a serious mental illness. It usually begins in your late teens or early 20s. More women have it than men. There's no known cause, but it's believed to be a combination of the way your brain is built and the things you experience in life. For example, you may be prone to have it based on genes passed down through your family. But then, something might happen that can trigger it, such as being abused or neglected. When you have BPD, you have a hard time controlling your emotions. This can cause you to: Take unnecessary risks Have intense mood swings Have bouts of anger, depression, or anxiety You may find it difficult to: Manage daily tasks at home Perform at work Maintain relationships This can lead to things like divorce, separation from family and friends, and serious financial issues. BPD isn't an isolated issue. If you have it, you are more likely to have other mental health challenges. You may experience anxiety , depression , eating disorders , and thoughts of suicide . Many cope by turning to drugs and alcohol, which can create more problems. Though there's no clear cure, the intensity of BPD may lessen with age and treatment."
49,Breastfeeding vs. Formula Feeding,"A big decision new moms must make for their little one’s nutrition is breast vs. formula. Some people can be uncomfortable around women while they are breastfeeding . However, if you pull out a bottle of formula, there are those who may criticize you for not feeding your baby what they might consider ""nature's perfect food"" -- breast milk. Welcome to mommy guilt. No matter what you decide, other people will surely have an opinion. Only one thing really matters: Which choice is right for you and your baby? Breastfeeding The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) says breast milk is the best nutrition for infants. Babies should be only breastfed for the first 6 months, according to the AAP. After the baby begins to eat other foods, the AAP encourages mothers to continue to breastfeed until at least the baby’s first birthday, or longer if the child and the parent are willing. Breastfeeding up to 2 years and beyond is beneficial for both, especially for mothers. Long-term breastfeeding may protect against diabetes, high blood pressure, and breast and ovarian cancers. Breast milk is good for your baby in many ways: It contains the proper proportion of nutrients that your baby needs, including protein, carbohydrates, fat, and calcium . It provides natural antibodies that help your baby resist illnesses, such as ear infections . It's usually more easily digested than formula. So breastfed babies are often less constipated and gassy. It may lower the risk of sudden infant death syndrome in the first year of your baby's life. It may raise your child's intelligence. Studies show that breastfed babies have higher levels of cognitive function. Breast milk may even help your child in later years, by reducing the risk of being overweight , and of developing asthma , allergies, type 1 and type 2 diabetes , high cholesterol , Hodgkin's disease , leukemia , and lymphoma . It’s always available and it’s free. Breastfeeding is good for moms, too. Women who breastfeed have a reduced risk of breast cancer , diabetes , heart disease , osteoporosis , and ovarian cancer . It can also help you lose your baby weight more easily, and make it less likely you’ll have postpartum depression . But let's not forget a key reason many new moms want to breastfeed. It's a wonderful bonding experience with your baby. Breast milk can also be pumped which will allow for public feedings and other family members to participate in feeding. Formula Feeding Formula feeding is also a healthy choice for babies. If you use a formula, your baby will get the best possible alternative to breast milk. (You should not attempt to make your own formula or feed an infant cow's milk or another kind of milk.) Many moms choose formula for a variety of reasons: It's convenient. Formula-fed babies can be fed by anyone at any time. It's flexible. You don't have to fit pumping into your work schedule. Instead, you can simply leave formula for your babysitter or day care center. Your partner can help out with nighttime feedings and share that bonding experience with your baby. Scheduling feedings may be easier. Formula isn't digested as quickly as breast milk, so formula-fed babies don't need to eat as often, especially in the first few months. You don't have to worry about what you eat. Moms who breastfeed may have to avoid certain foods that their baby can't tolerate. You can have a glass of wine or a cocktail once in a while. Alcohol is a no-no for women who breastfeed because they pass on tiny amounts of it to their babies. Supplemental Feeding Your doctor may recommend that you both breastfeed and give your baby formula, or that you add powdered or liquid fortifiers to pumped breast milk. That may be needed if: Your baby was born premature or with a very low birth weight and needs extra calories and nutrients Your baby has trouble latching on to breastfeed Your body isn’t making enough breast milk Your baby is dehydrated, has serious jaundice or has low blood sugar While your baby is getting supplemental feedings, it’s a good idea to pump your breast milk so you can start nursing as soon as baby is ready. Once their growth has caught up, you may be able to switch them exclusively to breast milk if you choose. Whichever way you choose to feed your baby -- breast milk, formula, or a combination of both -- the most important thing is that your baby is well-fed, well-cared for, and loved. So ditch the mommy guilt!"
50,Mad Cow Disease and vCJD: Should I Worry?,"What Is Mad Cow Disease? Mad cow disease or bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) can cause a rare but fatal disease in people called variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD). But the risk of getting vCJD from eating beef today is very low. (Photo Credit: DigitalVision/Getty Images) Mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), is a neurological disease in cattle that gets worse over time. Instead of viruses or bacteria, it's caused by an infection from an abnormal version of a protein, called a prion. For reasons still unknown, this protein becomes harmful and destroys nervous system tissue in the brain and spinal cord. Scientists think the first cases of BSE happened in the U.K. in the 1970s. Two cases were found in 1986. It's possible the disease arose first when cattle were fed meat-and-bone meal containing the BSE prion. It also may have come from products from sheep with a prion disease called scrapie. The outbreak spread in the U.K. because young calves were eating prion-infected meat-and-bone meal. Cows don't get BSE from being near other cows that have it. But it can be transmitted through the food supply. An outbreak of mad cow disease peaked in the U.K. in 1993, with about 1,000 cases every week. By the end of 2015, the U.K. had recorded more than 184,500 cases. But BSE is a lot less prevalent now, with only two cases reported in the U.K. in 2015. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has tested hundreds of thousands of cattle for BSE. But as of August 2018, only 6 cases have ever turned up in the U.S. and another 20 cases in Canada. The levels of BSE in the U.S. and Canada are so low it's hard to measure it. The best estimates suggest there are 0.167 cases per million in the U.S. and three to eight cases per million in Canada. What does mad cow disease look like in cattle? A cow with BSE may have trouble walking or standing up. They may seem nervous or aggressive. But it usually takes 4-6 years after a cow is infected with prions for it to show any signs of illness. There's no test for BSE in a living cow either. Once symptoms show up, cows usually die within weeks or months. Does Mad Cow Disease Affect Humans? When people get this disease, it isn't called mad cow. The human version of BSE is called variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD). There's strong evidence people can get vCJD by eating beef products with central nervous system tissue, such as brain and spinal cord, from cattle infected with mad cow disease. According to the CDC, four cases of vCJD have been reported in the U.S. But all of the people who developed vCJD in the U.S. had lived in other parts of the world, including the U.K. and Saudi Arabia. There's no record of anyone getting vCJD from eating infected beef in the U.S. It's important to understand the differences between variant CJD and another form of CJD, called classic or sporadic CJD. Classic CJD has no known cause and occurs each year at a rate of one to two cases per million people throughout the world, including the U.S. and countries where mad cow disease has never been reported. It's not linked to eating mad cow disease-affected cattle; both vegetarians and meat eaters have died from classic CJD. CJD most commonly affects people over 65 and is usually fatal within 6 months of the onset of symptoms. vCJD Symptoms The disease can affect all age groups and is very hard to diagnose until it has nearly run its course. In the early stages of vCJD, people have symptoms related to the nervous system, such as depression and loss of coordination. Later in the illness, dementia develops. But only in advanced stages of the disease can brain abnormalities be detected by an MRI. vCJD is fatal, usually within 13 months of the onset of symptoms. Early symptoms of vCJD include: Severe depression Withdrawing from family and friends Anxiety Irritability Trouble sleeping (insomnia) Advanced symptoms of vCJD include: Loss of coordination, causing trouble with walking, speaking, and balance Muscle twitches or spasms Incontinence Loss of bowel control Vision loss or blindness Loss of movement Memory loss Trouble concentrating Confusion or agitation Loss of appetite Paranoia Abnormal emotional responses In the final stages, people with vCJD won't know where they are and need care all the time. People often die from pneumonia or respiratory failure as their lungs stop working and they can't breathe. vCJD Diagnosis There's no way to know for sure a person has variant CJD until you look at their brain tissue, usually after death. But it's possible to look for it in a brain biopsy. vCJD is very rare, but doctors may suspect it when you have: Early death Psychiatric symptoms Persistent pain Dementia and other signs including loss of coordination and visual changes Illness for more than 6 months No evidence of another disease to explain the illness No history of classic CJD in your family or a prion protein gene mutation A doctor will run tests to see if your symptoms could be explained by classic CJD or another condition. Tests may include: MRI scans of your brain EEG recordings of your brain activity Lumbar puncture to test your cerebrospinal fluid Blood tests Biopsy of your tonsils to look for prions found in vCJD Genetic tests to see if you may have a hereditary or genetic prion disease Brain biopsy vCJD Treatment Doctors don't have any way to treat vCJD or other prion diseases. Treatment is aimed at managing symptoms and keeping you comfortable. Medicines to help with vCJD-related symptoms include: Antidepressants Sedatives Painkillers A person with any type of CJD, including vCJD, may want an advance directive to say what kind of treatment they want when the disease gets worse. It will say what kind of medicines they want to take and whether they'd want a tube to help them eat or breathe. Mad Cow Disease and vCJD Prevention The best way to prevent vCJD is to prevent cows from getting BSE. Countries have taken steps to control and prevent mad cow disease and vCJD, which include: BSE testing Killing sick animals Banning materials that are a risk for transmitting BSE in animal and human food and other products To make sure you don't get vCJD, you could avoid eating beef in countries where BSE is present. If you do eat beef, you could eat solid pieces such as steaks and avoid burgers or sausages containing ground meat that may be more likely to have prions in it. You can't get vCJD from drinking milk. There's some chance you could get vCJD from donor blood or blood products from an infected person. The risk is probably very small. To protect against this, the FDA defers blood donors who have: Spent a lot of time in countries with more BSE Used cow insulin from the U.K. Received a blood transfusion in the U.K. or France after 1980 Takeaways Mad cow disease or BSE is a disease cattle can get from infectious agents called prions. The human version, called vCJD, can spread when people eat beef contaminated with brain or spinal cord tissue from an infected cow, or if they receive blood from an infected person. While control measures have made BSE less common and vCJD is very rare, it's hard to diagnose and there's no treatment for the disease, which is fatal. Mad Cow Disease and vCJD FAQs Does cooking food kill the prion that causes mad cow disease? Common methods to get rid of disease-causing organisms in food, such as heating, do not affect prions. You can't get rid of prions with alcohol, acid, boiling water, high heat, or radiation. Is it possible to get vCJD from eating food purchased in the U.S.? It's extremely unlikely. To prevent mad cow disease from entering the country, since 1989, the federal government has banned imports of certain types of animals from countries where mad cow disease has been reported. This ban includes meat products used in human, animal, and pet foods. Also, banning high-risk animals from entering the food supply and the removal of central nervous system tissue from the food supply help ensure that BSE is not a risk in the U.S. Can you get vCJD from drinking milk from an infected cow? Milk and milk products are not believed to pose any risk for transmitting vCJD. Experiments have shown that milk from cows infected with mad cow disease doesn't cause infections. What about other products made from cow byproducts? The FDA doesn't allow materials from cattle in human food, dietary supplements, or cosmetics. The materials that are banned include the brain, skull, eyes, spinal cord, and other parts of the nervous system from cattle older than 30 months as well as the tonsils or small intestine from all cattle. You also can't use material from a disabled cow or cattle that hasn't passed inspection. What is the current risk of vCJD to Americans traveling abroad? According to the CDC, the current risk of acquiring vCJD appears to be extremely small. But the precise risk in any specific country is hard to know. What other countries have reported cases of mad cow disease? BSE was mostly in the U.K. But cases have been reported in other countries, including Ireland, Switzerland, France, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, Denmark, Canada, and the U.S. Can other animals get BSE? Yes, other animals can get their own versions of BSE. Similar illnesses infect sheep, goats, mink, deer, elk, and house cats. Do hunters need to worry about getting BSE from eating wild animals? Deer, moose, and elk can get a form of BSE called chronic wasting disease (CWD). Signs of a sick animal are stumbling, lowered head, droopy ears, and weakness. But there are no known cases of CWD passing from animals to people. You should still take precautions, such as not shooting, handling, or eating an animal that's acting sick or abnormal; avoiding contact with brain and spinal tissues; and processing your animals individually (not with meat from other animals)."
51,Bowel Obstruction,"What Is a Bowel Obstruction? A bowel obstruction is a serious problem that happens when something blocks your bowels, either your large or small intestine. It’s also known as an intestinal obstruction. If your digestive system comes to a grinding halt, you can’t have a bowel movement or pass gas. You might also notice stomach pain and a swollen belly. A common type of blockage is called fecal impaction. This is when a large, hard mass of poop gets stuck in your digestive tract and can’t get pushed out the usual way. But when your bowel is blocked by something other than hard stool, doctors call it a bowel obstruction. Types of Bowel Obstruction A bowel obstruction may be a partial blockage or a complete blockage. You can also have what’s called a pseudo-obstruction. This is when you have symptoms of a bowel obstruction but nothing physically blocking it. It can happen because of problems with your gastrointestinal muscles or with the nerves that control them. Bowel Obstruction Symptoms Signs of an intestinal blockage will depend on how severe the obstruction is. But it almost always comes with belly pain, usually around your belly button, and cramping. Other signs include: Constipation Can’t pass gas Lack of appetite Nausea or vomiting A hard, swollen belly Diarrhea (with a partial blockage) If you’ve been constipated and have any of these symptoms, contact your doctor right away. They’ll let you know what to do, including whether to call 911. Many people with bowel obstructions are older and may have other serious illnesses, so a bowel obstruction may be life-threatening. You’ll most likely need to go to the hospital for treatment. Bowel Obstruction Causes and Risk Factors Your bowel could become blocked in several ways: Part of your bowel may get twisted , which can close it off and keep anything from passing through. It can get inflamed and swell up. Part of your intestine can slide into another part like a telescope (intussusception). Scar tissue or a hernia could make your bowel too narrow for anything to pass through. A tumor or other type of growth inside your bowel could block it. Damaged blood vessels leading to the bowel can cause some bowel tissue to die. In many cases, inflammation , surgeries, or cancer can cause a bowel obstruction. It’s more likely to happen in older people. Bowel obstructions can happen in your small or large intestine, but they’re more likely to be in the small intestine. You might be at higher risk if you have: Crohn’s disease Diverticulitis Hernia Colon cancer Stomach cancer Ovarian cancer Scar tissue from surgery Radiation to your belly Lung cancer , breast cancer , or melanoma that’s spread to your bowel Bowel Obstruction Diagnosis Your doctor will ask about your medical history, including whether you’ve been constipated, if you’ve had cancer , and what new symptoms you’ve had. They also may: Do a physical exam to see if you have pain in your belly , if you’re able to pass gas, or if they can feel a lump in your belly Order blood tests Order urine tests Order a CT scan or an X-ray to look for a blockage Give you a barium enema . They’ll put a special liquid that contains barium (a whitish-silver metal) into your rectum. It will spread into your bowels and show on an X-ray as a bright area. If there’s a blockage, the barium may show it. Bowel Obstruction Treatment You’ll probably need to go to the hospital for treatment. Your doctor will give you medicine and fluids through a vein (intravenous or IV). They may also run a thin tube through your nose and into your stomach. This is called a nasogastric (NG) tube. It lets out fluids and gas to ease your symptoms. Most partial blockages get better on their own. Your doctor may give you a special diet that’s easier on your intestines. Enemas of air or fluid can help clear blockages by raising the pressure inside your bowels. A mesh tube called a stent is a safe option for people who are too sick for surgery. Your doctor puts it in your intestine to force the bowel open. Some people may not need anything more than a stent. Others may need surgery after they become stable. Surgery is usually the best treatment for a totally blocked intestine when your bowel is damaged. Your doctor can treat the cause of the obstruction or take out the blocked area and any damaged tissue. If you have surgery, you may need a colostomy or ileostomy. After your doctor takes out the damaged part of your intestine, they sew the rest to an opening in your skin. Poop exits your body through this opening and goes into a disposable bag. In some cases, your intestines can be reattached after you get better."
52,What Is Bowen’s Disease?,"This is a kind of skin cancer that affects the upper layer (epidermis) of your skin . Another name for it is squamous cell carcinoma in situ. “In situ” means the cancer “sits in” the upper layer and hasn’t spread into deeper ones. It usually affects white adults over age 60. Men seem to get it more often than women. Symptoms Bowen’s disease causes reddish, sometimes brown, patches on sun-damaged skin, most often on your legs. You may also see the patches on your head, neck, palms of your hands, and soles of your feet . Sometimes they develop around the genitals. Most people develop only one patch, but you can have several of them. They usually don’t cause any discomfort, but they may be: Flat Larger than a half-inch wide Scaly Crusty Oozing Itchy Sore Patches that appear on the genitals can cause problems. In that area, Bowen’s disease may be called one of the following: Bowenoid papulosis : This affects both men and women and causes lesions in the genital area. They can last from 2 weeks to several years. Erythroplasia of Queyrat: This affects the tip of a man’s penis . It may cause ulcers as well as discharge, bleeding, itching , or pain when peeing. Vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN): In women, it may cause velvety, bright red patches that itch or burn. The itching can become severe. Causes Bowenoid papulosis is caused by HPV (human papillomavirus), which also can cause genital warts and cervical cancer . The virus is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the U.S. Sexually active people under 30 are at the highest risk for it, because it’s most often passed through skin-to-skin contact. Scientists aren’t sure exactly what causes the other forms of Bowen’s disease. However, long-term sun exposure and aging may increase your odds of getting many skin cancers, including this one. Poisoning with arsenic also appears to make you more likely to get this early form of skin cancer . Diagnosis You can’t always tell by looking at your skin if you have Bowen’s disease. Many other skin conditions can look the same. It can be mistaken for harmless disorders -- like rashes or eczema -- as well as life-threatening ones, including melanoma . Your doctor usually has to take a sample of your skin for testing ( biopsy ) to confirm it. Treatments Bowen’s disease can spread to deeper layers of your skin. Your doctor (a dermatologist, who specializes in skin care and treatment) probably will recommend something called surgical excision. They’ll gently remove the cancerous area and about a quarter-inch beyond it. If you have a larger patch, you may need a more detailed procedure called Mohs surgery. A thin layer of tissue is removed and looked at under a microscope. If cancer cells are seen in the outside edges of the tissue, another thin layer is removed and studied. When no cancer cells are found, the surgery is over. Besides surgery, other treatment options are: Curettage and electrodessication: You’re given a shot of anesthetic to numb the area, and your doctor scrapes off the patches with a special tool. Then they’ll use high-frequency electric current to stop the bleeding. They may repeat the process if there are still cancer cells in deeper tissue. Fluorouracil : This is medication you put on your skin. It keeps the abnormal cells from growing and reproducing. It can cause redness, soreness, or peeling after 1 or 2 weeks, but this usually goes away within a month or two. Imiquimod : This is also medication you put on your skin. Doctors don’t know exactly how it works against cancer, but when it’s used to treat warts , it helps your immune system fight the virus that causes them. Liquid nitrogen cryosurgery: Your doctor sprays liquid nitrogen onto the affected area to freeze it. Afterward, the area will peel, blister , or scab over, depending on the amount used. Laser removal: Your doctor will use light energy (photons) to burn off the area. Photodynamic (“light”) therapy: This uses ultraviolet light rays to heal your skin. Sometimes you may put medication on your skin to make the cells more sensitive to the light. Radiation therapy : One type uses very tiny electrically charged particles (electrons) to target and kill cancer cells. This type of radiation enters only the upper layers of your skin, so deeper tissues and organs are safe. If you have Bowen’s disease, you’re at a higher risk for other types of skin cancers, especially if you have a weak immune system from disease or medical treatments. You should have regular follow-ups and skin checks with your doctor."
53,What Is BPH?,"You can do a lot to take care of yourself and give your body what it needs. Still, as you get older, your body changes in ways you can’t always control. For most men, one of those changes is that the prostate gets bigger. It’s a natural part of aging, but at some point, it can lead to a condition called BPH, or benign prostatic hyperplasia. Your prostate surrounds part of your urethra, the tube that carries urine and semen out of your penis. When you have BPH, your prostate is larger than usual, which squeezes the urethra. This can cause your pee stream to be weak, waking you up a lot at night to go to the bathroom along. it also could lead to other bothersome urinary symptoms. BPH isn’t prostate cancer and doesn’t make you more likely to get it. It’s a common condition, especially in older men, and there are a lot of treatments for it, from lifestyle changes to medication to surgery. Your doctor can help you choose the best care based on your age, health, and how the condition affects you. What Causes BPH? Doctors aren’t sure exactly what makes this happen. Some think it may have to do with normal hormonal changes as you age, but it’s not clear. Early in puberty, your prostate actually doubles in size. Later in life, around age 25, it starts to grow again. For most men, this growth happens for the rest of their lives. For some, it causes BPH . Symptoms As the prostate gets larger, it starts to pinch the urethra. This causes symptoms that affect your urine flow, such as: Dribbling when you finish A hard time getting started A weak stream, or you pee in stops and starts When your urethra is squeezed, it also means your bladder has to work harder to push urine out. Over time, the bladder muscles get weak, which makes it harder for it to empty. This can lead to: Feeling like you still have to pee even after you just went Having to go too often -- eight or more times a day Incontinence (when you don’t have control over when you pee) An urgent need to pee, all of a sudden You wake up several times a night to pee Urinary tract infections, bleeding, bladder damage, and bladder stones It rarely leads to other conditions, but it can, and a couple of them are serious. For example, BPH can lead to kidney damage or, worst-case, cause a problem where you can’t pee at all. A larger prostate doesn’t mean you’ll have more or worse symptoms. It’s different for each person. In fact, some men with very large prostates have few, if any, issues. Diagnosis and Tests Your doctor will first talk to you about your personal and family medical history. You might also fill out a survey, answering questions about your symptoms and how they affect you daily. Next, your doctor will do a physical exam . This may include a digital rectal exam. During this, they put on a glove and gently insert one finger into your rectum to check the size and shape of your prostate. Basic tests: Your doctor may start with one or more of these: Blood tests to check for kidney problems Urine tests to look for infection or other problems that could be causing your symptoms PSA (prostate-specific antigen) blood test. High PSA levels may be a sign of a larger-than-usual prostate. A doctor can also order it as screening for prostate cancer. Advanced tests: Based on the results of those tests, your doctor may order additional tests to rule out other problems or to see more clearly what’s happening. These might include: Different types of ultrasound to measure your prostate and see if it looks healthy. A bladder ultrasound to see how well you empty your bladder. Biopsy to rule out cancer. Urine flow test to measure how strong your stream is and how much pee you make. Urodynamics testing to evaluate your bladder function. Cystourethroscopy is a procedure using a  camera to examine the inside of the prostate, urethra and bladder. Treatments How your doctor handles your case varies based on your age, health, the size of your prostate, and how BPH affects you. If your symptoms don’t bother you too much, you can put off treatment and see how it goes. Lifestyle changes: You may want to start with things you can control. For example, you can: Do exercises to strengthen your pelvic floor muscles Lower the amount of fluids you drink, especially before you go out or go to bed Drink less caffeine and alcohol Medicine: For mild to moderate BPH, your doctor might suggest medicine. Some medications work by relaxing the muscles in your prostate and bladder. Others help shrink your prostate. For some men, it takes a mix of medicines to get the best results. Procedures: If lifestyle changes and medications don’t work, your doctor has a number of ways to remove part or all of your prostate. Many of these are called “minimally invasive,” meaning they’re easier on you than regular surgery. They use probes or scopes and don’t require large cuts in your body. Examples are TUMT,  Rezūm, and laser therapy to remove part of your prostate gland. Other surgeries include: Transurethral resection of the prostate, or TURP, in which the doctor uses a scope and cuts out pieces of the gland with a wire loop Transurethral incision of the prostate or TUIP, in which a few small cuts are made in the prostate to reduce the gland’s pressure on the urethra. UroLift system is a permanently placed device used to lift and hold the enlarged prostate tissue out of the way, so it no longer blocks the urethra . In some cases, your doctor may also suggest a traditional, open surgery or a robotic procedure to remove your prostate. Any Complications? With any BPH surgery, there may be side effects or complications such as bleeding, narrowing of the urine tube also known as urethral stricture, urinary incontinence or leakage, erectile dysfunction, and retrograde ejaculation. BPH doesn’t lead to prostate cancer or make you more likely to get it."
54,What is Bradycardia?,"Generally, it is normal to have a slower heart rate when you’re resting. It can be a sign of good health. But if it’s too slow, it could be a symptom of a condition called bradycardia. Normally, your heart beats 60 to 100 times a minute when you’re at rest. But with bradycardia, it goes down to less than 60 beats a minute. This might not cause a problem for some people. But it could be a clue that you have an issue with the electrical system in your heart. You need to see a doctor who can figure out why it’s beating slowly and if you should get treatment. Heart Basics Electrical signals travel through the heart’s four chambers -- two on the top called the atria and below them, the two ventricles. These signals prompt it to beat in a steady rhythm. But pulses don’t always fire off as they should. This creates what’s called arrhythmias , or abnormal heartbeats. Some conditions cause the heart to beat too fast or to flutter. With bradycardia, it’s the opposite. The electrical problem slows down the time in between heartbeats. You may simply have a slower-than-normal heart rate that doesn’t cause any symptoms. The electrical activity may be working fine, just a little slower than it does in most people. You wouldn’t even be diagnosed with this condition. And even with bradycardia, you may never notice any symptoms or need treatment. But that’s not always the case. Symptoms The biggest concern is your heart isn’t doing well enough at pumping blood to all the organs and tissues that need it. When this happens, the following may develop: Lightheadedness or dizziness Confusion or a hard time concentrating Fainting Shortness of breath (with or without chest pain ) You may also find that you tire out easily with even just a little activity. If you check your heart rate and it’s regularly below 60 beats per minute, be aware of those symptoms. If you have no other symptoms, you probably don’t need to see a doctor right away. You may exercise a lot, and a slow heart rate could be a sign of how fit you are. But, bring it up at your next appointment. When to See a Doctor If you or a loved one notices mild to medium symptoms, go to a doctor quickly. If you or a loved one faints, has chest pains or trouble breathing, call 911. Tiredness, trouble concentrating, or breathing harder may just seem like part of growing older. But sometimes it’s more than that. Be sure to tell your doctor about all your symptoms. If you wear out more easily now than you did a month or year ago, let them know. Causes The chances of getting bradycardia increase as you get older, though that’s true of most heart conditions . The causes of bradycardia can vary greatly from one person to the next. The abnormal rhythm can show up after a heart attack or as a side effect of heart surgery. Other things that can lead to it: Certain medications , such as those to treat high blood pressure and other arrhythmias, or abnormal heartbeats A congenital defect , or problem you’re born with Thyroid disease , an imbalance of hormones in the body Obstructive sleep apnea , when your breathing pauses many times throughout the night Diagnosis Bradycardia can be a little hard for doctors to figure out, because it’s not always present all the time. Your heart can go in and out of slow rhythms. Your doctor will be able to make the diagnosis if you’re having a bout of bradycardia during a test called an electrocardiogram. Often called an EKG, it’s a way to measure your heart’s electrical system . If your heart rate appears normal, but you have had symptoms of bradycardia, your doctor may have you wear a 24-hour monitor. Your doctor will ask about your personal and family health histories, as well as any symptoms you’ve had. Treatment If your doctor decides that you have bradycardia, the treatment plan will be based on the likely cause of the problem. For instance, if the cause is hypothyroidism , or low thyroid function, treating that may take care of the heart rate issue. If there is no clear physical cause, your doctor may change medications that might be slowing your heart. Beta blockers are sometimes prescribed to relax your heart muscle. But if they cause you to have a really slow heart rate, your doctor might lower the dosage or give you a different drug. If these approaches don’t work and your condition is serious enough to put your brain and other organs at risk, you may need a pacemaker. A surgeon will put this small device into your chest . It has thin, flexible wires, called leads, which extend to the heart. They carry small electrical charges that help keep the heart pumping at a steady rate. If you have been given a pacemaker, listen to your doctor’s instructions about how it operates and any signs it might not be working."
55,"Brain Aneurysms: Causes, Symptoms, and Treatment","What Is a Brain Aneurysm? A brain aneurysm is a weak spot in the wall of a blood vessel inside the brain that can sometimes burst and cause a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Think of a weak spot in a balloon and how it feels stretched out and thin. A brain aneurysm is like that. That area of the blood vessel gets worn out from constant flow of blood and bulges out, almost like a bubble. It can grow to the size of a small berry. Although brain aneurysms sound alarming, most don't cause symptoms or health problems. You can enjoy a long life without ever realizing that you have one. But in rare cases, aneurysms can grow big, leak, or explode. Bleeding in the brain, known as a hemorrhagic stroke , is serious, and you'll need medical care right away. Aneurysm vs. stroke Aneurysms and strokes are two very different medical conditions. A stroke happens when a blood vessel in the brain bursts (called a hemorrhagic stroke) or becomes blocked by a clot (called an ischemic stroke). On the other hand, an aneurysm is a bulge that occurs because of a weak artery wall. However, if an aneurysm bursts and bleeds, it may be thought of as a type of a hemorrhagic stroke. Strokes often strike without warning, while aneurysms can form over a long time. The treatment for each condition is also different. For a stroke, doctors give clot-busting drugs or perform a procedure to remove the clot. If you have an aneurysm , you may need surgery to repair the blood vessel. A sudden, intense headache could be an early symptom of a ruptured brain aneurysm. (Photo credit: Christopher Robbins / Getty Images) Brain Aneurysm Types There are different kinds of aneurysms, including: Saccular aneurysms are the most common type of brain aneurysm. They bulge out in a dome shape. They're connected to the artery by a narrow “neck.” A saccular aneurysm is also known as a “berry aneurysm” because it looks like a berry that hangs from a vine. Fusiform aneurysms aren't as common as saccular aneurysms. They don't pouch out in a dome shape. Instead, they make a widened spot in the blood vessel. This type of an aneurysm causes all sides of the artery to bulge. Mycotic aneurysms are caused by a bacterial, fungal, or viral infection that affects arteries in the brain. The infection can cause the artery wall to weaken. This type of an aneurysm is rare. Aneurysm Sizes Aneurysms come in different sizes: Small aneurysms are smaller than 11 millimeters (mm) in diameter, which is about the size of a pencil eraser. Large aneurysms measure 11-25 mm in diameter, which is about the size of a dime. Giant aneurysms are larger than 25 mm in diameter, which is more than the width of a quarter. How fast do brain aneurysms grow? Aneurysms grow at different rates. Some never grow at all. Others may take many years to develop. And some grow very quickly, in about a week's time. Brain Aneurysm Symptoms The type of symptom you have from a brain aneurysm depends on whether it ruptures. Ruptured brain aneurysm symptoms You need emergency care if you suddenly get an intensely painful headache, lose consciousness, or have any of these other symptoms of an aneurysm rupture: Intense headache that comes on suddenly Loss of consciousness Nausea and vomiting Drowsiness Loss of balance in things like walking and normal coordination Stiff neck Dilated pupils Sensitivity to light Sudden blurred or double vision Drooping eyelid Confusion or trouble with mental awareness Cardiac arrest (when the heart suddenly stops beating) Seizure Although brain aneurysms usually don't show symptoms, they can press on the brain and nerves as they get bigger. Unruptured brain aneurysm symptoms See a doctor at once if you're having a new headache or pain above or behind your eye. Call 911. Other symptoms of an unruptured aneurysm are: Dilated pupils Blurred or double vision Drooping eyelid A hard time speaking Weakness and numbness on one or both sides of your face Paralysis on one side of your face A sudden and intense headache can also be a sign you have a leaking aneurysm (sentinel bleed). This can be a warning sign you'll soon have a full rupture. Brain Aneurysm Causes It's possible to have a problem with blood vessels at birth that may lead to brain aneurysms. Some inherited conditions that are linked to brain aneurysms are: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. This condition causes small fluid-filled cysts to form on the kidneys. Neurofibromatosis type 1. It causes changes in skin color and tumors to grow along nerves in the skin, brain, and other areas of the body. Marfan syndrome. People with this disorder are typically tall with very long arms, fingers, legs, and toes. Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1. It causes tumors to grow in the endocrine glands, small intestine, and stomach. Pseudoxanthoma elasticum. With this disorder, calcium and other minerals build up in parts of connective tissue in the body. Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. It causes a tangle of blood vessels, called arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), to develop between arteries and veins. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome types II and IV. These conditions affect the connective tissue that supports the skin, bones, blood vessels, and other organs. Aneurysms tend to form at the fork of blood vessels, places where they branch off, because those sections tend to be weaker. They are most commonly found at the base of the brain. What Causes Brain Aneurysms to Rupture? If your brain aneurysm ruptures or leaks and causes a hemorrhagic stroke, you'll need medical treatment right away. This is rare but can be life-threatening. Your doctor usually won't know why your brain aneurysm ruptured. But experts know a few reasons that could heighten your risk of bleeding: High blood pressure. This is the most common factor that leads to a ruptured brain aneurysm. Heavy lifting or straining. Your brain aneurysm may rupture because of pressure from lifting or straining. Strong emotions. If you're very upset or angry, this can raise your blood pressure and lead to a ruptured aneurysm. Medications. Blood thinners including warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven) and other medicines or prescription drugs, such as diet pills like ephedrine and amphetamines, can cause an aneurysm to bleed. Illegal drugs. Drugs, like cocaine, can cause your aneurysm to rupture. Brain Aneurysm Risk Factors Brain aneurysms usually develop as people age, becoming more common after 40. Women tend to have higher rates of aneurysms than men. Smoking and high blood pressure are the things that put you at the most risk of having a brain aneurysm. But several other things in your medical history also raise your odds. Medical history Things in your medical history that can play a role include: High blood pressure Atherosclerosis, a disease in which fat builds up inside the walls of your arteries (blood vessels that deliver oxygen-rich blood throughout your body) Diseases affecting your blood or blood vessels: Connective tissue disorders such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome Polycystic kidney disease Injury or trauma to your head Infection Cancer or tumors in your head and neck Abnormalities at birth, such as tangled blood vessels in your brain, abnormally narrow aorta (coarctation of the aorta), or cerebral AVM (brain AVM) Family history of brain aneurysms Smoking Alcohol use, especially binge drinking Drug abuse, of stimulants like cocaine or amphetamines. Brain Aneurysms in Children Rarely, kids under 18 can have a brain aneurysm. Boys are eight times more likely to get them than girls. Of the few cases in children, about 20% are “giant” aneurysms (larger than 2.5 centimeters). Aneurysms in kids can come on for no reason. But they're also sometimes related to: Head trauma Connective tissue disorders Infection Genetic disorders Family history Brain Aneurysm Diagnosis Several types of scans and tests can be used to figure out whether you have a brain aneurysm. They include: CT scan: This exam creates images of your brain. You will lie on a table that slides into a CT scanner. A technician will inject a contrast dye into one of your veins to make it easier to see the blood flow and spot aneurysms in your brain. MRI : This exam is similar in that you lie on a table that slides into a scanner. The MRI uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed images of your brain and blood vessels. MRIs and CT scans can detect aneurysms larger than 3-5 mm. The following tests are more invasive than CT or MRI scans. But they could give you and your doctors a more complete picture of what's going on: Angiogram: This test, considered the most reliable way to detect aneurysms, shows the weak spots in your blood vessels. During the test, you lie on an X-ray table, and you will be given something to numb any pain. Your doctor will insert a small flexible tube through a blood vessel in the leg. They'll guide that tube, called a catheter, into the blood vessels in your neck that reach the brain. Then they'll inject a contrast dye into you, and X-rays will be taken that show all the blood vessels in the brain. This gives your doctor a map of your blood vessels, pinpointing the aneurysm. Spinal tap: Your doctor may order this test if they think an aneurysm may have ruptured. You'll be given a sedative to block any pain, though sometimes this procedure is performed under general aesthesia. Then, a technician will put a needle into you to draw spinal fluid. That fluid is tested to see whether it contains blood, which could mean an aneurysm has ruptured. Brain Aneurysm Treatment Small aneurysms that haven't ruptured and aren't causing symptoms may not need treatment. But this depends on your health and the aneurysm. You can talk this all over with your doctors. Doctors may consider these factors when deciding to treat an unruptured aneurysm: The size and location of the aneurysm How the aneurysm looks Your age and overall health Your family history Any conditions you were born with that could make a rupture more likely Brain aneurysm surgery You need treatment as soon as possible if you have a ruptured brain aneurysm because it's likely that it will bleed again. Treatment involves stopping the blood flow into the aneurysm. The procedures carry risks. Your doctor will figure out which treatment works best based on your health and the size, type, and location of the aneurysm. Surgical clipping: A section of your skull is removed to locate the aneurysm. A metal clip is placed on the opening of the aneurysm to cut off the blood flow. Your skull is then sealed shut. Endovascular coiling: This doesn't require surgery that opens the skull. Your doctor will insert a catheter into your groin to reach the affected blood vessel where the aneurysm is located. The doctor will send tiny platinum coils through the tube and place them inside the aneurysm. The coils conform to the shape of the aneurysm, stopping the blood flow there. This may be safer than surgical clipping, but it has a higher chance of the aneurysm bleeding again. Flow diverter surgery: This option is for larger brain aneurysms in which neither clipping nor coiling would work. In this procedure, your doctor inserts a stent , usually made of metal mesh, inside the artery. It becomes a wall inside the vessel to divert blood away from the aneurysm. Microvascular clipping: This type of surgery is an open procedure. Surgeons remove a small part of the skull to access the brain. Then, they use imaging tools to find the weakened area of the blood vessel and remove the aneurysm. A titanium clip is placed on the artery to stop bleeding and prevent a future rupture. Nonsurgical brain aneurysm treatment To help manage symptoms and prevent complications of an aneurysm, your doctor may suggest: Pain relievers such as acetaminophen Medications called calcium channel blockers that help prevent blood vessels from narrowing Treatments to prevent a stroke, such as drugs that widen the blood vessels so blood will flow through narrowed blood vessels, or a procedure called an angioplasty that uses a small balloon to widen blood vessels Antiseizure medication Ventricular or lumbar draining catheters to reduce pressure on the brain Shunt surgery Rehabilitative therapy to help you relearn skills you may have lost from damage to your brain Brain Aneurysm Complications A ruptured brain aneurysm can be life-threatening and lead to: Cerebral vasospasm (reduced blood flow to the brain) Hydrocephalus (too much spinal fluid in the brain) Coma Permanent brain damage It bleeding again Hyponatremia (low sodium in your blood) What's the Outlook With a Brain Aneurysm? You may never know that you have an unruptured brain aneurysm. If it doesn't rupture, you may live your entire life without any issues. But there's always a risk that it'll bleed. If this happens, you'll need immediate medical help. The longer you wait, the worse your outcome could be. Your chances of death or disability go up as more time passes after your aneurysm ruptures. Around 75% of people with a ruptured brain aneurysm will live longer than 24 hours. But a fourth of these people could have fatal complications within the next 6 months. If your doctor doesn't treat your aneurysm quickly enough, you might bleed again from the same area. So, it's important to get help as soon as possible if you think you have symptoms of a brain aneurysm. How to Prevent Brain Aneurysm There are no sure ways to prevent an aneurysm. But here are some steps you can take to lower your risk: Stop smoking if you smoke Keep high blood pressure under control Don't use drugs, such as cocaine Don't drink large amounts of alcohol Eat a balanced diet Work out regularly and avoid constant heavy lifting (stick with moderate exercise) Takeaways Most aneurysms aren't serious, but they can be life-threatening if they rupture. Many options are available to treat or prevent a rupture. Your doctor can help you identify the best strategy. Brain Aneurysm FAQs What are the warning signs of a brain aneurysm? If an aneurysm hasn't ruptured, you may not have any symptoms. Signs of a ruptured aneurysm include: A very bad, sudden headache Stiff neck Nausea and vomiting Blurred or double vision Light sensitivity Seizures Droopy eyelid Confusion A loss of consciousness Can a human survive a brain aneurysm? It's possible to survive a brain aneurysm. If the aneurysm ruptures, your chances of survival go down. What are the chances of surviving a brain aneurysm? Only about 50% of people with ruptured aneurysms will survive. Of those who make it, about 66% have a permanent brain problem."
56,Brain Tumors in Adults,"What is a Brain Tumor? A brain tumor is a cluster of abnormal cells that grows out of control in your brain . Some brain tumors are benign, which means the cells aren’t cancer . Others are malignant, meaning they’re cancer. Brain tumors are called primary tumors if they started in your brain. They’re considered secondary if they started somewhere else in your body and spread to your brain. Types of Brain Tumors Primary brain tumors come from cells that make up the brain and central nervous system . They’re named for the kind of cell in which they first form. There are more than 100 kinds of brain tumors. The most common types in adults are: Gliomas. These tumors start in the glial cells, which are cells that help keep nerves healthy. They’re most often cancer. There are several categories of gliomas, based on which specific cells they target. Astrocytomas are most common in adults. A glioblastoma is the most aggressive type of glial tumor. Meningiomas . These form in the meninges, the thin layer of tissue that covers the brain and spinal cord. They aren’t cancer, but they can cause problems by pressing on your brain. Schwannomas. These damage the protective coating of nerve cells. They aren’t cancer, but they often cause hearing loss or problems with balance. Pituitary adenomas. These form on the pituitary gland, which sits at the base of your brain. It makes important hormones. These tumors usually aren’t cancer and are slow growing. Benign vs. Malignant Brain Tumors Benign brain tumors aren’t aggressive and normally don’t spread to surrounding tissues, although they can be serious and even life-threatening. Benign brain tumors usually have clearly defined borders and usually aren’t deeply rooted in brain tissue. This makes them easier to surgically remove if they’re in an area of the brain where it’s safe to operate. But they can come back. Benign tumors are less likely to come back than cancerous ones. Even a benign brain tumor can be a serious health problem. Brain tumors can damage the cells around them by causing inflammation and putting increased pressure on nearby tissue, as well as inside your skull. Malignant primary brain tumors are cancers that start in your brain, typically grow faster than benign tumors, and quickly invade surrounding tissue. Although brain cancer rarely spreads to other organs, it can spread to other parts of your brain and central nervous system. Secondary brain tumors are cancer. They come from cancer that started somewhere else in your body and spread, or metastasized, to your brain. About 1 in 4 people with cancer develop a secondary brain tumor. Brain Tumor Symptoms Symptoms of brain tumors vary according to the type of tumor and the location. Because different areas of the brain control different functions of the body, where the tumor lies affects the symptoms you get. Some tumors have no symptoms until they’re large and then cause a serious, rapid decline in health. Other tumors may have symptoms that develop slowly. Common symptoms include: Headaches , which may not get better with the usual headache remedies. You may notice you’re getting them more often or they’re worse than usual. Seizures , particularly in a person who doesn't have a history of seizures Changes in speech or hearing Changes in vision Balance problems Problems with walking Numbness or tingling in the arms or legs Problems with memory Personality changes Inability to concentrate Weakness in one part of the body Morning vomiting without nausea These symptoms can result from many conditions. Don't assume you have a brain tumor just because you have some of the symptoms. Check with your doctor. Most of the time, doctors can’t tell what causes a brain tumor. There are only a few known risk factors for brain tumors in adults. Exposure to radiation . Children who receive radiation to the head have a higher risk of developing a brain tumor as adults. Family history . Some brain tumors are linked to certain rare genetic conditions such as neurofibromatosis or Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Age. People between ages 65 and 79 make up the population most likely to be diagnosed with a brain tumor. No history of chickenpox . One study has found that people who had chickenpox are less likely to get gliomas. Brain Tumor Diagnosis To diagnose a brain tumor, your doctor will start by asking questions about your symptoms, overall health, and family health history. Then they’ll do a physical exam , including a neurological exam. If there's reason to suspect a brain tumor, the doctor may request one or more of the following tests: Imaging studies like a CT scan or MRI to see detailed images of the brain Angiogram or MRA, which use dye and X-rays of blood vessels in the brain to look for signs of a tumor or abnormal blood vessels The doctor may also ask for a biopsy to see if the tumor is cancer. They’ll remove a tissue sample from your brain. They might do it during surgery to remove the tumor. Or they could insert a needle through a small hole drilled into your skull. They’ll send the sample to a lab for testing. Brain Tumor Treatment Your doctor will consider several things in deciding how to treat your brain tumor, including: Location of the tumor Size of the tumor Type of tumor Whether the tumor has spread Your overall health Potential complications Surgery to remove the tumor is typically the first option once a brain tumor has been diagnosed. But some tumors can't be surgically removed because of their location in the brain. In those cases, chemotherapy and radiation therapy may be options for killing and shrinking the tumor. Sometimes you’ll get chemotherapy or radiation after surgery to kill any remaining cancer cells. Your doctor may treat tumors that are deep in the brain or in areas that are difficult to reach with gamma knife therapy, a form of highly focused radiation therapy. Because treatment for cancer can damage healthy tissue, you should talk about possible long-term effects of whatever treatment is being used with your doctor. They can explain the risk and the possibility of losing certain faculties. The doctor can also explain the importance of planning for rehabilitation following treatment. Rehabilitation could involve working with several different therapists, such as: Physical therapists to regain strength and balance Speech therapists for help with speaking, expressing thoughts, or swallowing Occupational therapist to help manage daily activities such as using the bathroom, bathing, and dressing 10 Questions to Ask Your Doctor About Brain Tumors If you were recently diagnosed with a brain tumor, ask your doctor these questions at your next visit. 1. What type of brain tumor do I have, and what is its grade? 2. What are the symptoms of brain cancer ? 3. Which part of my brain is affected by the tumor and what does this region of the brain do? 4. Will it be possible to surgically remove my tumor? 5. If you can't surgically remove the tumor, will I need other treatments such as chemotherapy or radiotherapy after surgery? 6. What are the possible side effects of these therapies? 7. Who might my treatment team include, and for how long will I continue to see them? 8. Are there alternative treatments for my condition? 9. Will there be any lasting problems from this disease or its treatment? 10. Are there any support groups in the area that I can contact?"
57,Brain Cancer,"What Is Brain Cancer? Brain tumors are abnormal growths of cells in the brain . Although such growths are popularly called brain tumors, not all brain tumors are cancer . Cancer is a term reserved for malignant tumors. Malignant tumors can grow and spread aggressively, overpowering healthy cells by taking their space, blood , and nutrients. They can also spread to distant parts of the body. Like all cells of the body, tumor cells need blood and nutrients to survive. Tumors that don’t invade nearby tissue or spread to distant areas are called benign. In general, a benign tumor is less serious than a malignant tumor. But a benign tumor can still cause problems in your brain by pressing on nearby tissue. In the U.S., brain or nervous system tumors affect about 6 of every 1,000 people. Primary Brain Cancers The brain is made up of many different types of cells. Some brain cancers happen when one type of cell changes from its normal characteristics. Once transformed, the cells grow and multiply in abnormal ways. As these abnormal cells grow, they become a mass, or tumor. The brain tumors that result are called primary brain tumors because they start in your brain. The most common primary brain tumors are gliomas, meningiomas , pituitary adenomas, vestibular schwannomas, and primitive neuroectodermal tumors (medulloblastomas). The term glioma includes glioblastomas, astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas, and ependymomas. Most of these are named after the part of the brain or the type of brain cell from which they arise. Metastatic Brain Cancer Metastatic brain tumors are made of cancerous cells from a tumor elsewhere in the body. The cells spread to your brain from another tumor in a process called metastasis. This is the most common type of brain tumor . Causes of Brain Cancer The exact cause of most brain cancer is unknown. Genetic factors, various environmental toxins, radiation to the head, HIV, and cigarette smoking have all been linked to cancers of the brain. In most cases, no clear cause can be shown. Diagnosing Brain Cancer Your doctor will start by asking questions and giving you a physical exam to see if you have a problem with your brain or brain stem. They might do a CT scan of your brain. This test is like an X-ray but shows more detail in three dimensions. Usually, the doctor will inject a dye into your bloodstream to highlight problems on the scan. If the doctor thinks you have a tumor, they’ll follow up with an MRI scan. You might also get routine lab tests to check for other medical problems. These include analysis of blood, electrolytes , and liver function tests . If your mental status has been a problem, they might do blood or urine tests to make sure drugs aren’t a problem. If your scans show that you have brain cancer , the doctor will refer you to a cancer specialist called an oncologist. If there’s one in your area, you should see a specialist in brain tumors called a neuro-oncologist. The next step is to confirm that you have cancer. Doctors usually do this by taking and testing a sample of the tumor. This is called a biopsy : They’ll find the exact location of the tumor with a CT or MRI scan. Most of the time the doctor will have to open your skull to get to the tumor. They’ll try to remove the whole tumor if they can. They’ll take a sample from the tumor for the biopsy. If they can’t get the entire tumor, they’ll remove a small piece. If they can get to the tumor without surgery, they’ll make a small hole in your skull and guide a needle through the hole to the tumor. They’ll collect the biopsy sample with the needle. This technique is called stereotaxis or stereotactic biopsy. A doctor called a pathologist will examine the biopsy under a microscope. They specialize in diagnosing diseases by looking at cells and tissues. Brain Cancer Scans MRI Brain Cancer Picture: Side view section through the brain of a young girl. The white arrow shows a brain tumor that involves the brainstem. MRI Brain Cancer Picture: Cross-section (image taken from the top of the head down) of a brain tumor in a young girl. The white arrow shows the tumor. Can You Travel If You Have Brain Cancer? While brain cancer can limit where, when, and how you travel, getting away may be good for you. A trip -- whether for work, pleasure, or to go to a clinical trial -- may help you know that you can still do things that you want to do. But before you book your trip, you’ll want to check on these things. Driving. The doctor will let you know if it’s OK based on the location of your cancer and symptoms like vision trouble or seizures . Flying. You should be able to fly about 3 months after you finish brain cancer treatment . But check with your doctor first. Changes in pressure could cause headaches or brain swelling . Treatments. If the trip might make you miss a cancer treatment, talk to your doctor about rescheduling. And get a letter from your doctor explaining your condition and treatments, especially if you have a port or medical implant and plan to go through airport security. If you’re going somewhere that English isn’t widely spoken, make a copy of the letter in that language. You may also want to wear a special medical alert bracelet if you could have seizures . Arrange medical care ahead of time. Make a list of resources in the area that you’ll visit. Include a doctor, hospital that treats brain cancer, and urgent care center. If you need lab work while you’re away, your doctor can help you figure out where and when to have this done. During your trip To stay well and curb stress levels while you travel: Keep your medicine with you. Checked luggage can get lost. Pack prescription meds in your carry-on bag for flights. Keep them in their original packages, which show what they are. You may also want to bring extra in case your trip home gets delayed. Avoid germs. Wash your hands or use hand sanitizer often. Protect your skin . Use sunscreen . Many cancer treatments can make you more likely to get a sunburn . Keep up your energy. Drink plenty of water during the day and carry snacks with you. Eating small meals often will help, too. Pace yourself. Travel can be tiring for anyone. In a big airport or train station, it’s OK to ask for help getting to your gate or a wheelchair. At your destination, consider what’s realistic for you to do in a day, rest when you need to, and enjoy your trip."
58,Pemphigus,"What Is Pemphigus? Pemphigus is the name for a group of autoimmune diseases. These conditions cause your body’s natural defense system to attack itself. If you have pemphigus, your immune system tries to destroy your skin and mucous membranes -- the moist parts of your body. That can cause large blisters in your mouth, nose, throat, eyes, and genitals. Pemphigus isn’t contagious. Luckily, it can be treated with medications. Pemphigus Types and Symptoms There are several types of this condition. Your symptoms will depend on what type you have. Pemphigus vulgaris. This is the most common form. It affects the moist parts of your body, like your mouth and genitals. Adults between ages 30 and 60 are most likely to get it. The first sign of a problem will typically be blisters in your mouth that peel easily. You may find it hard to swallow or eat. Next, blisters will often form on your skin or inside your genitals. They hurt, but they don’t itch. Pemphigus foliaceus. These are crusty blisters that tend to form on your chest, back, and shoulders. They don’t hurt, but they do itch. Endemic pemphigus (fogo selvagem). This is a rare type of pemphigus foliaceus that happens most often in South America, especially Brazil. It often affects more than one member of the same family. Pemphigus vegetans. This type is a lot like pemphigus vulgaris. But instead of blisters, it forms thick, wart-like lesions. These usually appear on parts of the body where your skin rubs against itself, like the armpit or groin. Drug-induced pemphigus . If you have this type, certain medications will cause blisters that can form up to 6 months after you’ve taken them. Pemphigus erythematosus (Senear-Usher syndrome). Blisters show up on your scalp, cheeks, upper back, and upper chest. They can turn into red, crusty lesions. Paraneoplastic pemphigus. This is the rarest type of pemphigus. It affects people who have cancer. If you have it, you may have blisters in your mouth that you can’t treat. Treating the cancer will help to ease the blisters. Causes Pemphigus is an autoimmune disorder. This means that your immune system attacks your body’s cells -- in this case, the skin cells. In rare cases, certain drugs can trigger the condition. This includes penicillin and some rheumatoid arthritis medications. But most of the time, we don’t know what causes it. It isn’t contagious. Who Does Pemphigus Affect? Some people are more likely to develop this condition than others. This includes those who are: Of Jewish ancestry Of Indian, Middle Eastern, or Southeastern European descent Are 40 years old and older People with autoimmune diseases, especially the disease myasthenia gravis. Pemphigus Diagnosis It can be tricky. That’s because a number of conditions can cause blisters. To make sure they find the right cause, your doctor will likely order a number of tests, including: Medical history. Your doctor will ask you what medications you take, as some drugs can cause this condition. A skin exam. Your doctor will use their finger or a cotton swab to rub a patch of your skin that’s not covered by a blister. If it peels easily, you could have pemphigus. Skin biopsy. Your doctor will take a piece of tissue from one of your blisters and look at it under a microscope. Blood tests. Your doctor will check your blood for specific antibodies called desmogleins. Antibodies are proteins your body makes to find bad germs and kill them before they harm you. If you have pemphigus, you’ll have more of these antibodies in your blood than normal. As your symptoms improve, the number of these antibodies in your blood goes down. Endoscopy. If you have blisters in your mouth, your doctor may use a thin, flexible tube called an endoscope to look down your throat. Conditions With Similar Symptoms Some skin diseases can look like pemphigus. Bullous pemphigoid, for example, causes large, fluid-filled blisters, but they generally don’t burst as easily. And unlike pemphigus, it usually affects people over age 60. Herpes is another condition that can cause painful blisters on your mouth and genitals. But it’s not caused by your body attacking itself. If you have itchy or painful blisters anywhere on your body, don’t try to figure out what’s wrong. See your doctor. Only they can tell you for sure whether you have pemphigus or something else. Pemphigus Treatment Your doctor will likely give you medicine that’ll help ease your symptoms and make you more comfortable. What they prescribe will depend on what type of pemphigus you have and how bad your symptoms are. Treatment might include: Corticosteroids. These are usually the first line of treatment and can be very effective to relieve symptoms, often within a couple of weeks. They are typically given in pill form. Immunosuppressants. These drugs keep your immune system from attacking healthy tissues. Biological therapies. If other medications aren’t working, your doctor may give you a medication called rituximab (Rituxan). You'll get it in an injection. It helps decrease the number of antibodies that are attacking your body. Antibiotics, antivirals, and antifungal medications. These fight or prevent infections. If pemphigus isn’t treated, it could be life-threatening. Sometimes, you may have to be admitted to the hospital until you get better. Wound care. Topical antibiotics and wound dressings are used to heal the blisters. Plasmapheresis. If the pemphigus doesn’t respond to the other treatments, your doctor can use a special machine to take the plasma from your blood. They then replace it with plasma from a blood donor. Pemphigus Complications Several serious complications can happen with pemphigus. Among them: Skin infections Infections that get into the bloodstream (sepsis) Being unable to eat, leading to weight loss and malnutrition Depression Some forms of the condition can cause death if not treated The medications that you take for pemphigus can also cause serious side effects. They can include: Infections Rashes High blood pressure Low bone density (osteoporosis) At least 75% of people with pemphigus will have a complete remission, or no evidence of the disease, after 10 years of treatment. Some people must take medications for the rest of their lives to keep pemphigus symptoms from coming back."
59,What Is Chagas Disease?,"Chagas disease isn’t well-known in America, but it’s been around for thousands of years. A parasite called Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi) causes it. The disease infects up to 8 million people, mostly in Latin America. But cases recently started popping up in Texas. How Do You Get It? T. cruzi isn’t passed from person to person like a cold or flu. Instead, the parasite is spread by triatomine bugs, also known as “ kissing bugs.” They’re called that because they often bite people on the thin skin around the eyes or mouth, usually while the person is asleep. (The bites are fairly painless and probably wouldn’t wake someone up.) But the bug’s bite isn’t what causes the infection -- it’s their poop. If a bug bites an infected animal or person, it becomes a carrier of T. cruzi, which is passed through its feces. The next time the bug feeds on a person, it leaves droppings on them, which can enter that person’s body through their eyes , nose, mouth , or the wound from the bite itself. Although people mainly get infected from triatomine bugs, the parasite can be passed a few other ways: A blood transfusion or organ transplant from an infected person. Eating uncooked food that’s been contaminated with the parasite, or eating undercooked meat from an infected animal. An infected pregnant mother can transmit the disease to their baby in the womb. In November 2014, a study from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine found that bed bugs can carry T. cruzi. It’s not clear whether these bugs are likely to pass the parasite to people, though. Symptoms Chagas disease has two phases. During the first (or acute) phase, symptoms are usually mild. They might include: Fever, fatigue , or other flu -like symptoms A rash A sore where the parasite has entered the body Vomiting , diarrhea , or loss of appetite Swollen eyelids, if the parasite has entered through the eyes (known as Romaña’s sign) These early symptoms -- if they happen at all -- usually fade on their own in a few weeks or months. The only people in real danger are young children or people with already weakened immune systems. While the symptoms may go away, the parasite remains in the body. It can stay dormant for years or even decades. If the disease enters its second (or chronic) phase, it can cause serious heart and intestinal problems, including: An enlarged heart , esophagus , or colon Heart failure An altered heart rhythm Blood clots Sudden cardiac arrest Treatment Chagas disease is easiest to treat during the first phase. But the lack of symptoms can make it tough to spot early on. If you think you have it, your doctor can give you blood tests. If the tests show you're infected, you’ll need an EKG test to check for any heart problems. Two drugs can treat the disease: benznidazole (Alunbrig) and nifurtimox (Lampit), which kill the parasite. They work well if taken soon after infection. The longer someone's had Chagas disease, the less likely the drugs are to work. Pregnant women can’t take them, but infected newborns can. If you’re in the U.S., the only way to get the drugs is through the CDC, since they’re not approved by the FDA. The drugs must be taken for up to 2 months. They can cause serious side effects, especially in older people. Can It Be Prevented? There is no vaccine. The best way to prevent it is by avoiding triatomine bugs. They tend to live in homes made from mud, adobe, straw, and palm thatch, according to the CDC. If you’re traveling in Latin America, it’s best to stay out of these types of dwellings. You can also protect yourself by using nets to cover your bed while sleeping. Since 2007, blood banks in the U.S. have begun screening for Chagas, so there's no longer any chance of infection from the blood supply in America."
60,Breast Cancer and Pregnancy,"It doesn’t happen often, but sometimes mothers-to-be have breast cancer . Getting pregnant doesn't cause the cancer , although the changes in hormones from the pregnancy can make the disease grow faster. Your breasts thicken while you're expecting, and that can make it hard to spot small masses or lumps. Because of this, breast cancer tumors are often larger and more advanced by the time they’re noticed. This makes it extra important to have breast exams throughout pregnancy. Any lumps or suspicious symptoms need to be checked by a doctor. How Is It Diagnosed? The best thing you can do while pregnant is to see your doctor regularly. These visits are called prenatal (or ""before birth"") checkups, and they're crucial for keeping you and your baby in the best possible health. During some of these visits, you may have breast exams to check for changes. A mammogram is considered fairly safe during pregnancy, but it may not be as helpful because of the increased density of the breasts. A three-dimensional mammogram may be a better option. If a suspicious lump is found, your doctor should do a biopsy . They'll remove a small sample of the suspicious tissue with a needle or by making a small cut. The sample tissue gets checked under a microscope and with other methods to look for any cancer cells. Your doctor might also give you an ultrasound to assess the extent of any disease and to guide the biopsy. What Happens to My Baby if I Have Breast Cancer? Ending a pregnancy won’t improve a woman's chances of beating breast cancer. Also, there's no evidence that the cancer harms the baby . But the treatments have risks. Surgery, in general, is safe during any trimester of pregnancy. If the cancer is still in its early stages, your doctor will most likely recommend removing either the suspicious lump ( lumpectomy ) or the entire breast ( mastectomy ). If you're in the first or second trimester , a mastectomy is the preferred surgery. Lumpectomy is usually an option for women diagnosed in the third trimester . Radiation therapy usually doesn’t start until after pregnancy because it can harm the baby . During breast cancer surgery, the surgeon will examine the lymph nodes to see whether any are affected. They'll often remove the ones where the cancer is most likely to have spread. If you need chemotherapy, your doctor will usually wait until after the first trimester to lessen the chance that it will harm the baby. Advanced breast cancer usually requires both surgery and chemotherapy , so the risk for the baby is higher. The decision of whether or not to undergo treatment can be a very hard one. Talk with your family and doctor about what's right for you. Can I Breastfeed My Baby if I Have Breast Cancer? There’s no evidence that stopping your flow of breast milk will improve your cancer. It’s often okay to breastfeed when you have this disease, but talk with your doctor or a lactation counselor to see what's best for you and your baby. If you're getting chemotherapy, you likely shouldn’t breastfeed . Many powerful chemo drugs can travel through your milk to the baby."
61,Breast Cancer and Genetic Testing,"Women with a family history of breast cancer make up about 15% of all women with the disease. Having a close relative (mother, sister, or daughter) with breast cancer doubles your risk. Breast Cancer Genes Each cell in your body has about 20,500 genes. Genes are tiny segments of DNA that control how cells function. One copy of each gene comes from your mother. The other is from your father. Genes can develop changes (also called abnormalities or mutations) that change how the cell works. Mutations in two genes -- BRCA1 and BRCA2 -- are the most common causes of hereditary breast cancer, accounting for about 20% to 25% of cases. Usually, BRCA genes help prevent cancer by fixing DNA damage that can lead to cancers and tumors. They also make proteins that help stop tumors from growing. If either of your parents carries one of these mutations, you have a 50% chance of having it. And if you have it, you can pass it on to your children. If you inherit a mutated BRCA1 or BRCA2, you have higher odds of getting cancer . Know the Risks Women who inherit the mutated BRCA1 gene have a 55% to 65% risk of breast cancer by age 70. Women with mutated BRCA2 have about a 45% risk. Men with a BRCA mutation are also at a higher risk of breast cancer. Either mutation brings a higher risk of getting breast cancer at a younger age (before menopause). People who have a mutated BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene have a higher risk of a second primary breast cancer, too. Bilateral breast cancer (cancer in both breasts) is also more common in women who carry a BRCA 1 or BRCA2 gene. These mutations also raise your risk of ovarian cancer , fallopian tube cancer, peritoneal cancer , and pancreatic cancer . Men face a higher risk of prostate cancer . Should I Be Tested for Genetic Mutations? At-risk families can take blood tests to look for mutations in these genes. You may want to discuss genetic testing with your doctor if: You have two or more blood relatives -- mother, sister, aunt, cousin, or daughter -- with premenopausal breast cancer or ovarian cancer diagnosed at any age. You were diagnosed with breast cancer, especially before menopause, and have a blood relative with breast or ovarian cancer. You were diagnosed with ovarian cancer and you have blood relatives who have had ovarian or breast cancer. A male in your family has or had breast cancer. You or a family member has been diagnosed with bilateral breast cancer (cancer in both breasts). You were diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer before the age of 60. You are related to someone (male or female) who has a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. You are of Ashkenazi Jewish descent and have had breast or ovarian cancer or have blood relatives who have had breast or ovarian cancer. Before Genetic Testing Counseling is required before undergoing genetic testing for breast cancer. During this educational session, a health care provider will explain the benefits and risks of genetic testing and answer any questions you may have. You’ll also have to sign a consent form. It’s an agreement between you and your health care provider, showing that you have discussed the tests and understand how the results might affect you and your family. Here are some questions to consider when thinking about genetic testing: Am I prepared to cope with the result? Are my family members also prepared, including my children and my spouse? What are my goals for testing? How would I use my test results? What will I do differently if the results are positive or negative? With whom will I share my results? Would a positive test result change relationships with my family? What Happens During Genetic Testing? You'll need a family pedigree to learn whether there is a cancer development pattern in your family. A family pedigree is a chart that shows the genetic makeup of a person's ancestors. It’s used to analyze characteristics or diseases that are passed down through a family. Then, you’ll have a blood test to learn whether you have a breast cancer gene. Keep in mind that the vast majority of breast cancer cases are not linked with a breast cancer gene. In addition, scientists do not know all of the genes that can cause breast cancer , so they can test you only for the known genes. When someone with a cancer diagnosis and a family history of the disease is found to have an altered BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene, the family is said to have a ""known mutation."" If there’s a link between the development of breast cancer and a breast cancer gene, then all family members willing to have genetic testing are asked to give a sample of blood. For many people, knowing their test results is important because this information may help to guide health care decisions for themselves and their families. How Do I Interpret the Genetic Test Results? A negative genetic test means that a breast cancer gene mutation was not identified. If other genetic testing has identified a mutation in your family, a negative test means you do not have the specific mutation. Therefore, your risk of cancer is the same as someone in the general population who has a family history of breast cancer. If a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation has not been previously found in your family, a negative result should be interpreted cautiously. There is still a chance that you may be at higher risk for breast cancer because of changes in genes other than those that doctors can test for. A positive test result means that a mutation known to raise the risk of breast and ovarian cancer was identified. What Are My Options if I Have a 'Cancer Gene'? Women in high-risk categories (first-degree relative with breast cancer, previous abnormal breast biopsy results with atypical ductal hyperplasia or lobular hyperplasia or lobular carcinoma in situ) and those who have the genes linked with breast cancer should consider starting regular breast cancer screening at age 25, or 10 years earlier than the age of the youngest relative with breast cancer at the time of their diagnosis. Get to know how your breasts look and feel. If you notice any changes, see your doctor right away. And talk with your doctor about blood tests, pelvic exams, and transvaginal ultrasound to look for ovarian cancer. Some women choose to have a preventive (prophylactic) mastectomy to lower their chances of breast cancer. It’s also possible to have your ovaries and fallopian tubes taken out. This doesn’t get rid of all risk, but it does significantly lower it. Another approach includes using anti-estrogen drugs: Tamoxifen , useful in premenopausal and post-menopausal women Raloxifene ( Evista ), used to treat osteoporosis; useful only in post-menopausal women Exemestane ( Aromasin ), an aromatase inhibitor; useful only in post-menopausal women What Are the Potential Problems With Genetic Testing? Genetic testing is not 100% accurate. If a test is negative, a person still has a chance of getting breast cancer. If the test is positive, there is still a 15% to 20% chance of not getting breast cancer. Genetic testing is costly, ranging from about $400 to more than $3,000, depending on the type of test. Insurance coverage varies. The results of genetic tests won't be available for several weeks. The length of time it takes to get results depends on the tests performed and under what circumstances they are done. Genetic testing is very controversial. Legislation has been enacted to protect people who may have a documented genetic risk of cancer from employment or insurance problems. The best thing you can do is to become involved with an established genetic registry that can counsel people who have a genetic risk for cancer. What Are the Benefits of Genetic Testing? For some women, genetic testing may help you make informed medical and lifestyle decisions while easing the anxiety of not knowing their genetic background. You can also make a decision regarding prevention, with both medications and prophylactic surgery. In addition, many women take part in medical research that, in the long run, may lower their risk of death from breast cancer. What About My Privacy? The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 prevents insurance companies from denying coverage based on genetic information. This act also prevents insurance companies from using genetic information to determine that a health condition existed before application was made for insurance. In addition, many states have passed laws, or have legislation pending, addressing insurance concerns."
62,Breast Cancer in Men,"Even though men don't have breasts like women’s, they have a small amount of breast tissue. The ""breasts"" of a man are similar to the breasts of a girl before puberty . Girls’ tissue grows and develops, but men’s doesn't. But because they still have breast tissue, men can get breast cancer . Men get the same types of breast cancers that women do, but cancers involving the parts that make and store milk are rare. The risk of a man getting breast cancer in his lifetime is about 1 per 1,000. Doctors used to think that breast cancer in men was more severe than it was in women, but it now seems that it's about the same. The major problem is that breast cancer in men is often diagnosed later than breast cancer in women. This may be because men are less likely to be suspicious of something strange in that area. Which Men Are More Likely to Get Breast Cancer? It's rare for a man under age 35 to get breast cancer . Your chance of getting breast cancer goes up with age. Most breast cancers in men happen between ages 60 and 70. Other things that raise the odds for male breast cancer include: Breast cancer in a close female relative History of radiation exposure of the chest Enlarged breasts ( gynecomastia ) because of drug or hormone treatments, some infections, or poisons Taking estrogen A rare genetic condition called Klinefelter's syndrome Severe liver disease , called cirrhosis Diseases of the testicles such as mumps orchitis , a testicular injury, or an undescended testicle Obesity Symptoms Symptoms of breast cancer in men are similar to those in women. Most male breast cancers are diagnosed when a man finds a lump on his chest. But men tend to delay going to the doctor until they have more severe symptoms, like bleeding from the nipple. By that point, the cancer may have spread. Diagnosis and Treatment The same techniques that are used to diagnose breast cancer in women are used in men: physical exams, mammography , and biopsies (looking at small samples of tissue under a microscope). Treatments for men and women are generally the same. Many men benefit from a combination of treatments, such as: Surgery. The typical treatment for men is a mastectomy , in which your entire breast is removed. Breast-conserving surgery -- in which only the tumor is taken out -- is sometimes done. Often, the surgeon also takes out one or more lymph nodes to see if the cancer has spread. Radiation therapy . You may have treatment with radioactive rays or particles after surgery. It can help kill off any cancer cells that surgery missed. If the cancer is inoperable, radiation may be your main treatment. Chemotherapy . With this treatment, you’ll be given drugs -- by mouth or by injection -- to attack the cancer cells. You may have chemotherapy after surgery to lower the risk of the cancer coming back. For men with advanced cancer or cancer that has spread to other parts of the body, chemotherapy may be the primary treatment. Hormone therapy. Some kinds of breast cancer need certain hormones to grow. This therapy blocks the effects of these hormones, stopping the cancer’s growth. It often works better in men than in women because about 90% of men’s cancers are hormone receptor -positive. The drug tamoxifen is the standard hormone therapy for male breast cancer. Sometimes, removal of the testes reduces the amount of certain male hormones in the system. Men with breast cancer should never take testosterone, because it causes breast cancer cells to grow. You may have hormone therapy after surgery to lower the risk of the cancer coming back. For men with locally advanced or metastatic cancer, it may be the primary treatment. Targeted therapy. Some men have an excess of a protein ( HER2 ) that makes cancer spread quickly. Trastuzumab ( Herceptin ) is one of the drugs that has been approved to treat breast cancer that has spread to other areas of the body. It stops this protein from making cancer cells grow. It may also boost your immune system , giving it more strength to fight the cancer. Remember, like anyone who has breast cancer or who has recovered from it, you'll need to have checkups with your doctor for the rest of your life. Getting regular medical care is key to staying healthy."
63,Risk Factors for Breast Cancer,"In 1940, the lifetime risk of a woman developing breast cancer was 5%, or one in 20.  The risk today is 12% -- or one in 8. In many cases, it's not known why a woman gets breast cancer . What Are the Risk Factors for Breast Cancer? A risk factor is anything that increases a person's chance of getting a disease. Different cancers have different risk factors. However, having a cancer risk factor, or even several of them, does not necessarily mean that a person will get cancer . Some women with one or more breast cancer risk factors never develop breast cancer , while about half of women with breast cancer have no apparent risk factors. Significantly higher risk History . A woman with a history of cancer in one breast, such as ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or invasive breast cancer , is three to four times likelier to develop a new breast cancer, unrelated to the first one, in either the other breast or in another part of the same breast. This is different than a recurrence of the previous breast cancer. Age . Your risk for breast cancer increases as you age. About 80% of women diagnosed with breast cancer each year are ages 45 or older, and about 43% are ages 65 or above. Consider this: In women ages 40 to 50, there is a one in 69 risk of developing breast cancer. From ages 50 to 60, that risk increases to one in 43. In the 60 to 70 age group, the risk is one in 29. In women ages 70 and older, one in 26 is at risk of developing the disease. Moderately higher risk Direct family history . Having a mother, sister, or daughter (""first-degree"" relative) who has breast cancer puts a woman at higher risk for the disease. The risk is even greater if this relative developed breast cancer before menopause and had cancer in both breasts . Having one first-degree relative with breast cancer approximately doubles the risk in women, and having two first-degree relatives triples their risk. Having a male blood relative with breast cancer will also increase a woman's risk of the disease. Genetics. About 5% to 10% of breast cancer cases are thought to be hereditary. Carriers of alterations in either of two familial breast cancer genes called BRCA1 or BRCA2 are at higher risk. Women with an inherited alteration in the BRCA1 gene have about a 72% chance of developing breast cancer by age 80, and those with an inherited alteration in the BRCA2 gene have about a 69% chance of developing breast cancer.  There are several other types of abnormal genes that increase risk of breast cancer. Breast lesions . A previous breast biopsy result of atypical hyperplasia (lobular or ductal) or lobular carcinoma in situ increases a woman's breast cancer risk by four to five times. Slightly higher risk Distant family history. This refers to breast cancer in second- or third-degree relatives such as aunts, grandmothers, and cousins. Previous abnormal breast biopsy. Women with earlier biopsies showing any of the following have a slight increased risk: fibroadenomas with complex features, hyperplasia without atypia, sclerosing adenosis, and solitary papilloma. Having dense breasts. Your breasts have more fibrous than fatty tissue. Age at childbirth . Having your first child after age 35 or never having children puts you at higher risk. Early menstruation. Longer lifetime exposure to endogenous (your own) estrogen increases your risk, such as starting to menstruate before age 12, starting menopause after age 55, and never having had a pregnancy . Weight. Being overweight (especially in the waist), with excess caloric and fat intake, increases your risk, especially after menopause. Excessive radiation . This is especially true for women who were exposed to a large amount of radiation before age 30 -- usually as treatment for cancers such as lymphoma . Other cancer in the family. If a family member had ovarian cancer under age 50, your risk is increased. Heritage. Female descendants of Eastern and Central European Jews (Ashkenazi) are at increased risk. Alcohol. Use of alcohol is linked to increased risk of developing breast cancer. Compared with nondrinkers, women who consume one alcoholic drink a day have a very small i ncrease in risk, and those who have 2 to 5 drinks daily have about 1.5 times the risk of women who do not drink. Race . Caucasian women are at a slightly higher risk of developing breast cancer than are African-American, Asian, Hispanic, and Native American women. The exception to this is African-American women, who are more likely than Caucasians to have breast cancer under age 40. Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT). Long-term use of combined estrogen and progesterone increases the risk of breast cancer. This risk seems to return to that of the general population after discontinuing them for five years or longer. Low risk Less lifetime exposure to endogenous estrogen . Having a pregnancy before age 18, starting menopause early, and having the ovaries removed before age 37 decreases the risk of developing breast cancer. Factors not related to breast cancer: Fibrocystic breast changes Multiple pregnancies Coffee or caffeine intake Use of antiperspirants Wearing underwire bras Using hair dye Having an abortion or miscarriage Using breast implants Scientists are still investigating whether smoking, high-fat diets, lack of exercise, and environmental pollution increase breast cancer risk. Some studies have suggested that women who are using birth control pills have a very slight increased risk of developing breast cancer. That risk disappears after stopping them for 10 years or more. Still other studies show no connection. More research is under way to confirm these findings. Women who breastfeed have a reduced risk of breast cancer.

64,How Do I Know if I Have Metastatic Breast Cancer?,"If your breast cancer spreads to other parts of your body, doctors will call it “metastatic.” (""Metastasize"" means to spread.) It tends to go to the bones, lungs , liver , and brain . You’ll get tests before and during treatment to see if your breast cancer has spread. Signs and symptoms depend on where it is. When it’s in your bones you may have: Pain , such as back or hip pain Bone fractures or breaks Too much calcium in your blood A leg or arm that feels numb or weak If breast cancer spreads to your lungs , it can make you feel: Short of breath Tired When it spreads to your liver , it can cause: Belly pain or swelling Appetite loss Yellow skin or eyes Tiredness Confusion If it’s in your brain , you might notice: You can’t feel or move part of your body Headaches that don’t get better or go away Seizures Vision or hearing changes You feel sleepy Your doctor may find it before you have symptoms. But if you have any of the signs listed here, tell your doctor right away Other things can cause these symptoms, but you should get them checked out, especially if you’ve had breast cancer before. Tests You might get blood tests done, but these can’t show for sure that cancer has spread. You’ll need to get imaging tests to see if the cancer has spread, and, if so, how far and to what parts of your body. Some of the tests that you may get include: PET scan : You’ll get a radioactive sugar injected into your blood. Cancer cells will quickly use it up. A scan then shows all the places in your body where the sugar was concentrated and metabolized. These areas could be cancer. Bone scan: A radioactive tracer put into your blood collects in changed areas of bone that might be cancer. These “hot spots” can then be seen on a whole-body scan. CT scan : Special X-rays show detailed 3-D pictures of your insides. Sometimes, doctors use a dye to get clearer pictures. You may get this test done at the same time as a PET scan (called a PET-CT). MRI : This test uses strong magnets to get detailed pictures of organs and structures inside your body. It’s very good at finding brain metastases and bone metastases. Ultrasound : This type of test uses sound waves to look for tumors in your liver or other parts of your belly. X-rays: These tests are fast, and doctors can use them to look for changes in bones, like fractures or breaks. But they won’t have as much detail as other imaging tests. Biopsy : If there is a suspicion of metastatic breast cancer, you may need an additional tissue biopsy to confirm the presence of breast cancer cells in the area or areas of concern. Your doctor may use a CT or ultrasound to help find the right spot to test. You’ll get a small piece of the changed area taken out (often with a needle) and tested in a lab. Doctors will look for cancer cells and may do other tests, too. When cancer cells are found, your doctor will order more lab tests to see whether they’re breast cancer cells or another kind of cancer. Test Results It takes time to schedule and get your imaging tests, and then more time to get a biopsy. Your imaging test results might be ready in a day or two. Biopsy results can take up to a week. Your doctor can give you an idea of how long it will take. Ask how you’ll get the results -- A phone call? An office visit? If you don’t hear from your doctor within a week, call the office. It can be hard to wait. If you’re concerned that the cancer could get worse during that time, keep in mind that in most cases, the relatively short wait (though it feels long to you) won’t make a difference to the cancer. If you have questions or are worried, tell your doctor. The answers may help you better understand your situation and the help you can get."
65,Breast Cancer Screening and Diagnosis,"Why Breast Cancer Screening Matters The sooner breast cancer gets diagnosed, the better your odds of getting successful treatment. That's why it’s important to get mammograms as recommended, to be familiar with how your breasts usually look, and to report any changes to your doctor ASAP. Why? Breast cancer risk is up: The lifetime risk of a woman getting breast cancer in the U.S. was around 5%, or 1 in 20, in 1940. Now it’s 12%, or more than 1 in 8. Finding breast cancer earlier boosts your survival odds: Women who have breast cancer screening mammograms are much less likely to die from the disease. This depends on: The quality of the test Getting screened as often as you need to Following your treatment plan if you get diagnosed Self-Exams, Doctor’s Clinical Breast Exams It's a good idea to know how your breasts normally look and feel so you can notice any changes. Medical organizations have different recommendations for breast self-exams, though. The American Cancer Society, for example, states that research has not shown a clear benefit of doing regular breast self-exams. Talk with your doctor to get a better sense of what's right for you. Learn more about how to do a breast self-exam . A clinical breast exam is done by your doctor, to feel for lumps or other changes. It’s part of your regular checkup. Your doctor will feel both breasts, one at a time. They’ll also check the underarm and collarbone areas. If they notice suspicious lumps, they may say you should get other tests. Your doctor will also examine the breasts visually for any rashes or anything else that looks unusual. And they may lightly squeeze your nipples to see if any fluid comes out. Mammograms A mammogram is an X-ray of the breast. It can show breast lumps up to 2 years before they can be felt. Different tests help determine if a lump may be cancer . Ones that aren’t cancerous tend to have different physical features than ones that are. Imaging tests such as mammograms and ultrasounds can often see the difference. Screening mammograms are those that are looking at your breasts when you don’t have a specific lump or other concern. Diagnostic mammograms focus on a specific area or areas that you or your doctor is concerned about, such as where you have a suspicious lump, breast pain, discharge from a nipple, changes in size or shape of the breasts, or certain skin changes on the breast. When and if you need screening mammograms is a personal decision between you and your doctor. Most women don’t start having screening mammograms until they’re at least 40. If you’re at higher risk for breast cancer, your doctor may want you to start at a younger age. Read about how digital mammograms can give a clearer picture . Breast MRI This test combines several images of your breast into one to create a detailed picture. It’s more often used after you’re diagnosed to see how far cancer has spread, but your doctor might combine it with a mammogram as a screening test if: You’re at a high risk for breast cancer. You have a family history of breast or ovarian cancer . Your breasts are dense (there are a lot of ducts, glands, and fibrous tissue, but little fat) and mammograms didn't find a previous breast cancer. You have dense breasts , a strong family history of breast cancer, and you’ve had precancerous breast changes like atypical hyperplasia or lobular carcinoma in situ. You have the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation. You had radiation treatments to your chest area before you were 30. Know more about MRI to diagnose breast cancer . Breast Ultrasound Your doctor is most likely to use this if you have dense breasts. It’s also an option if you’re at high risk for breast cancer and you can’t have an MRI or if you’re pregnant so you aren’t exposed to X-rays from a mammogram. Get more details on what happens during a breast ultrasound . Screening Recommendations For women at average risk, the American Cancer Society recommends that women ages: 45 to 54: Get yearly mammograms 55 and older: Can switch to getting a mammogram every other year or continue getting yearly mammograms 40 to 44: It’s OK to start a yearly mammogram. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening mammograms every other year for women ages 50-74. The decision to get a mammogram every other year from age 40 to 49 is up to you and your doctor. How Do Doctors Diagnose Breast Cancer? The only way to confirm cancer is for a doctor to do a needle aspiration or surgical breast biopsy to collect and test tissue for cancer cells. Find out what to expect with a breast biopsy . If It’s Cancer If you’re diagnosed with breast cancer, you and your doctor will need to know what type it is and how advanced it is. A check of your lymph nodes can tell if the disease has spread. Other tests give an idea of what treatments may work best for you, and still others predict how likely it is that your cancer will come back after treatment. Your doctor can help you understand all of these tests, and together you’ll decide on the best treatment plan for you. Get more information on what to do after a breast cancer diagnosis ."
66,Breast Cancer Treatment,"Breast cancer treatments are getting better all the time, and people have many more options today than ever. With so many choices, it’s a good idea to learn as much as you can about the ones that can help you the most. All breast cancer treatments have two main goals: To rid your body of as much of the cancer as possible, ideally - all of it To keep the disease from coming back How Do I Know Which Breast Cancer Treatment to Choose? Your doctor will think about a few things before they recommend a treatment for you: The type of breast cancer you have The size of your tumor and how far the cancer has spread in your body, called the stage of your disease Whether your tumor has things called receptors for HER2 protein, estrogen, and progesterone, or other specific features Whether your breast cancer is associated with certain genetic mutations Your age, whether you’ve gone through menopause, other health conditions you have, and your personal preferences also play a role in this decision-making process. What Are the Types of Breast Cancer Treatment? Some treatments remove or destroy the disease within the breast and nearby tissues. These include: Surgery. For most people, one of the first steps is to take out the tumor. You may have chemotherapy before surgery to shrink the tumor. An operation called lumpectomy removes only the part of your breast that has cancer. It’s sometimes called breast-conserving surgery or partial mastectomy. In a mastectomy, doctors remove the whole breast. There are different types of mastectomies and lumpectomies. Radiation therapy. This treatment uses high-energy waves to kill cancer cells. Many women under age 70 who have a lumpectomy get radiation, too. Doctors also might recommend this method if the disease has spread. It helps destroy any cancer cells that the surgeon couldn’t remove. Radiation can come from a machine outside your body, or you might have tiny seeds that give off radiation placed inside your breast where the tumor was. Other treatments destroy or control cancer cells all over your body: Chemotherapy uses drugs to kill cancer cells. You take the medicines as pills or through an IV. Many people get it after surgery to kill any cancer cells left behind. Doctors also prescribe it before surgery to make tumors smaller. Chemo works well against cancer, but it also can harm healthy cells. Hormone therapy uses drugs to prevent hormones, especially estrogen, from fueling the growth of breast cancer cells. Without estrogen, tumors dependent on this hormone for growth will shrink. Medicines include t amoxifen ( Nolvadex ) for women before and after menopause and aromatase inhibitors including anastrozole ( Arimidex ), exemestane ( Aromasin ), and l etrozole ( Femara ) for postmenopausal women. Some types of this therapy work by stopping the ovaries from making hormones, either through surgery or medication. Fulvestrant ( Faslodex ) is an injection that keeps estrogen from attaching to cancer cells. Elacestrant ( Orserdu ) is an oral drug that binds to estrogen receptors used to treat postmenopausal women or men with certain types of advanced breast cancer with an ESR1 mutation. Targeted therapy such as margetuximab ( Margenza ), pertuzumab ( Perjeta ), and trastuzumab ( Herceptin ) trigger your body’s immune system to help destroy cancer cells. These medicines target breast cancer cells that have high levels of a protein called HER2. Ado-trastuzumab emtansine ( Kadcyla ) and fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan ( Enhertu ) combine trastuzumab and chemotherapy to target HER2-positive cancer cells. The medications lapatinib ( Tykerb ), neratinib ( Nerlynx ), and tucatinib ( Tukysa) block types of protein in cancer cells called kinases. Abemaciclib ( Verzenio ), palbociclib ( Ibrance ), and ribociclib ( Kisqali ) are kinase inhibitors often used with an aromatase inhibitor or the drug fulvestrant ( Faslodex ) in people with certain types of advanced cancer. Abemaciclib (Verzenio) can be used alone in women who have already been treated with hormone therapy and chemotherapy. Alpelisib ( Piqray ) is a PI3K inhibitor used to treat certain types of breast cancer in people who have a PIK3CA gene mutation. A new class of drugs called PARP inhibitors targets a protein inside of cancer cells. PARP inhibitors include olaparib ( Lynparza ) and talazoparib ( Talzenna ). Immunotherapy uses your own immune system to target and fight cancer. The drug pembrolizumab ( Keytruda ) blocks a protein on certain immune cells called T cells that stimulates the immune system to attack tumor cells.  It’s used with chemotherapy to treat triple-negative breast cancer. The medication sacituzumab govitecan-hziy ( Trodelvy ) combines an antibody with chemotherapy. It has been approved to treat triple-negative breast cancer that has spread. Your treatment may include a combination of surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, hormone therapy, or immunotherapy. Tips to Help You Choose Although there are some typical breast cancer treatment regimens, women do have choices. Talk with your doctor about all the risks and benefits of each treatment option and how they will affect your lifestyle. Think about joining a support group. Other people with breast cancer know what you’re going through and can give you advice and understanding. They might help you decide on a treatment, too. Ask your doctor whether you should join a clinical trial, which is a research study that tests new treatments before they’re available to everyone. Side Effects of Treatment Most breast cancer treatments have side effects. Many go away when the therapy stops. Some may show up later. Common side effects include: Nausea Weight gain or loss Fatigue Arm swelling Hair loss Skin or nail changes Mouth sores Symptoms of menopause, such as hot flashes Trouble getting pregnant Depression Trouble sleeping Trouble thinking clearly (""chemo brain"") Cancer Treatment, Premature Menopause, and Infertility About a quarter of the nearly 288,000 women diagnosed with breast cancer in the U.S. each year have not gone through menopause. Some chemotherapy and hormone therapy drugs that treat breast cancer can cause permanent or temporary infertility or early menopause. Women who haven’t yet gone through menopause should use birth control while having these treatments because some chemotherapy drugs are linked with birth defects. Chemotherapy-induced menopause happens in 10% to 50% of women younger than 40 and in 50% to 94% of women over 40. After chemotherapy, you may have months or even years of uneven ovarian function. Radiation therapy won’t cause infertility unless it is directed at both ovaries. Depending on the type and extent of the breast cancer, your ovaries may be surgically removed or radiated to lower the amount of estrogen that your body makes. This will cause permanent infertility. Women with breast cancer who want to start or expand a family later on should consider options to keep fertility before beginning treatment. These include: Freezing eggs or embryos. Freezing ovarian tissue. Egg-producing tissue from your ovaries is removed and frozen. Egg donation. You can get eggs from a donor that are fertilized and implanted after cancer treatment. Hormonal suppression of the reproductive organs. This approach involves using hormones to put your reproductive organs in a dormant (inactive) state. It seems to protect the cells that develop into eggs (germ cells) from damage by chemotherapy. This approach is still being investigated. Dealing With Visible Side Effects of Treatment You may be able to see some of the side effects of breast cancer treatment, and this can take an emotional toll. But there’s a lot you can do to overcome them, and that can help you feel better. Breast changes If you've had a mastectomy, you can use an external prosthesis instead of, or before, breast reconstruction surgery. You tuck it into a bra or attach it to your skin with double-sided tape. If you choose to get one: Ask your doctor for a prescription for an external prosthesis. Then, it can usually be covered by insurance. Ask your oncologist for a referral to a specialized store that sells external prostheses. You may also find them in some lingerie departments. Make an appointment with a breast prosthesis consultant and allow yourself about an hour to get fitted. Try a variety of them to see which feels and looks the best on you. Hair loss Some chemotherapy kills fast-growing cells like hair follicles, whether those cells are cancer or not. Hair loss is different for everyone, and it depends on the type of chemo you're taking. Radiation and hormonal treatments may also cause this side effect. Some people use cooling caps to help reduce hair loss due to chemotherapy. Cooling the scalp before, during, and after may reduce the amount of chemo that gets to hair follicles. Since there are some long-term safety concerns about using a cooling cap, it’s best to talk with your doctor before you decide to use one. If you lose hair from chemo, it's likely to fall out within 1 to 2 weeks of starting treatment. It may thin or fall out almost all at once. It's common to lose hair over your whole body, not just on your head. This means you may lose eyelashes and eyebrows as well as arm, leg, and pubic hair. Hair can begin to grow back even before your treatment is done. It may be thinner or a different color or texture. You can prepare for hair loss and make it easier to deal with. For example, many women find it helpful to cut their hair short before it starts falling out. This way you can avoid losing large clumps of it in the shower or waking to large amounts on the pillow. Here are some other tips that may help: Consider buying scarves, turbans, caps, or hats before your hair falls out. Ask your oncologist for a ""cranial prosthesis"" prescription to help ensure insurance coverage for a wig. Check with wig retailers and makers, your hair stylist, or the American Cancer Society to learn about wig and hair product options. Before you begin chemotherapy, match your hair texture or color to wigs. This is also a good time to have a wig styled. But if you get fitted with a wig early, know that it may fit slightly differently once you lose your hair. Prepare loved ones, especially children, for how you'll look with your hair gone. It may help to involve them in choosing scarves and other products. If you choose to go bald, remember to use sunscreen on your head when in the sun. Keep your head warm in cold climates, too. Arm swelling Doctors call this lymphedema. It's swelling in the arm on the side where you've had breast or lymph node surgery. It can also happen after you get radiation. It’s often a temporary side effect, but it can be permanent. If so, it can affect your quality of life. You can lessen its impact if you spot the symptoms of it early. Don't ignore any swelling in your arm. Avoid injuring the skin of an affected arm. Wear gloves when you garden or do housework. Avoid extreme water-temperature changes. Keep your arm protected from the sun. Avoid getting shots or IVs on your affected arm. Don't carry heavy handbags or wear heavy jewelry on the affected side. The swelling may affect the type of clothing you can wear. You may need an elastic compression sleeve to control swelling, along with more loose-fitting clothes. Ask your doctor for a referral to a certified lymphedema therapist. They can show you safe exercises and other techniques to help avoid or reduce swelling. Weight gain or loss You might have either during your treatment. Weight loss might be due to nausea, vomiting, or appetite changes. Weight gain is sometimes brought on by chemotherapy or hormone therapy, which can both cause early menopause. But some other medications you may take can also cause you to put on extra pounds, as can changes in your diet and being less active. Now is not the time to diet. Eat nutritious, balanced meals to help yourself stay at a healthy weight, keep up your energy, and heal. These recommendations may help: Eat plenty of protein, but limit saturated fat, sugar, alcohol, and salt. Eat smaller meals more often throughout the day, especially if you're nauseated. Exercise to help with weight control and keep up your appetite. Exercise helps with other side effects too, such as fatigue and depression. Ask your doctor what activity level is right for you. Find an exercise partner to help you stick with a routine. Even a few minutes a day can make a positive difference in how you feel. Skin and nail changes You might notice these after chemotherapy, radiation, or hormone treatment. Skin changes may include: Redness Rash Dryness Inflammation Darkening of veins Redness from radiation and certain types of chemo may get worse if you expose your skin to the sun. It’s rare, but skin damage can happen if chemo drugs given through a vein (IV) leak onto the skin. Let your doctor know about any breaks or cuts in your skin, which can become infected. Also: Check with your medical team before you use any skin products. This includes lotions, powders, perfumes, creams, deodorants, body oils, or home remedies. Additives in some products can worsen skin reactions. Avoid detergents with dyes and perfumes. Keep your skin clean and dry. Use a mild soap, and pat your skin dry after bathing. Use a rich moisturizer as recommended by your doctor several times a day to help with dry skin. Use sunscreen when in the sun. Wear loose-fitting, natural fabrics like cotton and silk. Nail beds may become darkened or discolored. Your nails may crack, split, or become rigid. Sometimes, they may even lift off the nail bed. Tell your doctor if this happens. It increases the risk of infection. Other nail tips: Cut them short to minimize splitting. Avoid artificial nails, which may increase the risk of an infection. It's OK to use nail polish, but remove it with a non acetone-based remover, which is less drying. Use a cuticle remover cream or gel, massaging it into your nails. Don't bite or tear at your nails or cuticles. Wear gloves when you garden or do housework. Avoid professional manicures, or bring your own sanitized instruments. Limit the time you have your hands in water to lower the risk of fungal infections. Skin and nail changes usually go away when your treatment ends. Sadness and Depression The experience of breast cancer will have an effect on your emotions. You may feel tired, frustrated, angry, and sad at different times. Depression can sometimes happen during the breast cancer experience. Chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, and some pain medications can help cause these feelings or make them worse. Signs that you’re depressed include: Sadness Lack of energy Loss of interest in things you usually enjoy Trouble sleeping or sleeping more than usual Feeling hopeless Thoughts of suicide If you have depressed feelings, talk to your doctor. They can help you figure out if it’s because of depression or extreme fatigue. They may be able to switch out one or more of your medications. They may suggest complementary medicine such as yoga or art therapy. If needed, they can prescribe antidepressants or refer you to a therapist. Depression can make it hard for you to stay on your cancer treatment. It’s important to manage the feeling so that it doesn’t overwhelm you. There are a number of simple things you can do to help yourself feel better, a little at a time: Remember that your feelings can and will change. Do things that make you feel calm and relaxed: Take a walk, watch your favorite TV show, or work on a puzzle. Get moderate exercise. Eat a healthy diet and stay away from refined, sugary foods and alcohol. Spend time every day with a friend or loved ones. Find someone you can talk to, whether it’s a friend, loved one, or therapist. Go easy on yourself: Don’t expect to do everything you did at the same pace as you did before you had cancer. Break chores into smaller steps and let others help you when possible. Put off important decisions, such as changing jobs or getting married, until you feel better. Palliative Treatment Both breast cancer and the treatment you get for it cause symptoms and side effects. Even if the main goal of your treatment is a cure, palliative care that eases discomfort and emotional distress is an important part of your treatment. You can have palliative care while you continue to have therapy focused on curing the disease. The type of palliative care you get depends on several things: Your specific symptoms Your baseline health The stage of your cancer Your wishes Talk to your doctor about palliative care at the start of your treatment. They’ll help you find the type that fits your needs as your treatment goes on. Your options may include medications, chemo, or radiation to shrink tumors and ease pain, changes to your diet, mental health care, stress reduction, and more. Complementary/Integrative Medicine This refers to practices that aren’t part of standard medicine but can be used along with it as part of your overall cancer treatment plan. It’s different from alternative medicine, which is used in place of standard medical treatment. Some alternative treatments aren’t backed by science. They not only won’t treat your cancer, but they could be dangerous as well. Complementary medicine doesn’t treat your cancer directly. But it can help you: Lessen symptoms of cancer or its treatment, such as nausea or pain Ease stress and anxiety Feel more in control of your treatment Have a better quality of life These are just a few of the many forms of complementary medicine available: Yoga or tai chi Meditation, hypnosis, and guided imagery Acupuncture Creative therapy, such as painting, writing, music, or crafts Massage Botanicals, including herbs and cannabis If you want to try complementary medicine as part of your treatment plan, talk to your doctor first. Some things that seem harmless could actually be dangerous when you have cancer or could negatively impact your treatment. Your doctor can suggest therapies that are right for you and have been proven to be safe and able to meet your goals for using them. The National Cancer Institute has a list of current clinical trials for complementary therapies at its website. The 'Look Good Feel Better' Program The American Cancer Society has teamed up with the Personal Care Products Council and the National Cosmetology Association to create ""Look Good Feel Better."" This program teaches beauty techniques that can boost your appearance and how you feel about yourself after your cancer treatment.

67,Gynecomastia,"What Is Gynecomastia (Enlarged Breasts in Men)? Gynecomastia is a condition that makes breast tissue swell in boys and men. It can happen when the balance of two hormones in your body is thrown off. If you have enlarged breasts because of fat deposits, you have a different condition called ""pseudogynecomastia."" Although breasts don't develop in men the way they do in women, all boys are born with a small amount of breast tissue. Boys' bodies mostly make a hormone called testosterone , which guides their sexual growth during puberty . But males also make some estrogen -- the hormone that steers sexual growth in girls. When a boy is going through puberty, or when an older man's body makes less testosterone, the balance of the two hormones changes. Sometimes when that happens, a higher percentage of estrogen causes male breast tissue to swell. About half of adolescent boys and as many as two-thirds of men older than 50 will have this to some degree. Gynecomastia Symptoms Your first sign of gynecomastia may be a lump of fatty tissue under the nipple. Sometimes this lump is tender or sore. This might make you worry that you have breast cancer , which does occur in a small number of men. Gynecomastia is not necessarily a sign of cancer , but your doctor may run some tests to rule it out. Swelling of the breasts may happen unevenly, with one becoming larger than the other. You may also have breast tenderness. See your doctor if you notice that your breasts have swelling, are painful or tender, or there is a discharge from the nipple of one or both breasts. Gynecomastia Causes A lot of things can trigger the hormone imbalance that causes male breast growth, and many times the exact cause isn't known. In addition to body changes such as puberty and aging, some things that can cause gynecomastia are: Injury or diseases that affect the testicles, which make testosterone Thyroid problems , since hormones from that gland control growth and sexual development Some cancers, including tumors of the lungs , pituitary gland, or adrenal glands Obesity, which can result in more estrogen Illegal drugs , including anabolic steroids , marijuana , and heroin Kidney failure (when they can no longer clean and filter your blood ) Liver disease Some infant boys may get gynecomastia briefly while hormones from their mother are still in their bodies. Some types of medicines can lead to gynecomastia, such as: Anti-androgens. These are drugs that treat an enlarged prostate or prostate cancer . Anabolic steroids and androgens. Athletes sometimes use these drugs illicitly in an effort to improve their athletic performance. The drugs also have legitimate uses for certain conditions. HIV drugs. Gynecomastia can sometimes be a side effect of an HIV treatment called ""highly active antiretroviral therapy."" Anti-anxiety drugs. Medicines such as diazepam ( Valium ) can sometimes cause gynecomastia. Heart medications. Drugs such asdigoxin (Lanoxin) and calcium channel blockers can lead to gynecomastia sometimes. Medicines used to empty your stomach. For example, metoclopramide ( Reglan ) can have gynecomastia as a side effect. Ulcer drugs. Some medicines that you buy over the counter for ulcers can lead to gynecomastia, such as cimetidine ( Tagamet HB). Some antibiotics can also cause gynecomastia. So can tricyclic antidepressants and some cancer treatments. Gynecomastia Diagnosis If your doctor suspects you have gynecomastia, they will probably examine you to make sure there are no hard lumps, oozing fluid, or skin problems that could be signs of cancer . They will also likely ask you questions about your medical history that might include: Have you had illnesses such as mumps , kidney ailments, or liver disease? What drugs have you taken -- legal or illegal? You might also be given tests. They could include: Blood tests or urine samples Mammogram Biopsy CT scans MRI scans Testicular ultrasounds Gynecomastia Treatment Most cases slowly get better on their own without treatment. When you have gynecomastia, your doctor might refer you to a specialist known as an endocrinologist , who treats problems related to hormones and how they affect your body. How your condition is treated may depend on your age, your health, how long your condition may last, and how well you respond to certain drugs. If gynecomastia happens during puberty, it usually goes away on its own. This might take anywhere from 6 months to 3 years. If it turns out your hormones are out of balance because of another health problem, you'll want to treat that underlying condition. You might be given medication to address the hormone imbalance that's causing breast growth. In some cases, you might need surgery. Your doctor may recommend techniques such as: Liposuction (removal of extra breast fat) Mastectomy (removal of breast gland tissue) Gynecomastia Prevention There are steps you can take to lower your chances of having gynecomastia. They include things such as: Don't use illicit or recreational drugs, such as anabolic steroids, androgens, amphetamines, marijuana, or heroin. Don't drink alcohol, or drink moderately. Go over your medicine list with your doctor. If any of your medications can cause gynecomastia, ask if there are alternatives. Gynecomastia Complications Gynecomastia can have an impact on your mental health . You might feel embarrassed, or feel anxious or depressed. There are steps you can take to manage these feelings. Talk to you doctor about how gynecomastia is making you feel. They can suggest a mental health professional who can help you manage any mental health problems you may get. Also talk to your family and close friends. They know you best and can give you the emotional backing you need. Support groups can also help. You'll get a chance to talk to others who understand what you're going through. Ask your doctor for help in finding groups that you can connect with."
68,Breast Engorgement,"What Is Engorgement? Breast engorgement means that your breasts are filled with too much milk. It can make them feel swollen, warm, and tender. It’s normal before you start breastfeeding and can mild or more intense. After you deliver a baby , your body is still hard at work. Two of its new missions: helping you heal and getting food to your newborn . In the hours and days following labor , circulation to your breasts increases. At first, they produce a thick, yellowish fluid called colostrum . It's full of protein and everything your baby needs to build a strong digestive system and stay healthy. Three to 4 days after labor , your body makes milk all the time and stores it in your breast tissue. The first time your milk comes in, your breasts can become engorged, or filled with too much milk. Breast Engorgement Symptoms If your breasts are engorged, they may feel: Warm Heavy Tender and painful Swollen, which may extend to the armpit Hard Trouble for your baby to latch onto You may also have lumps or flattened nipples. There’s a chance that engorgement could block milk ducts and lead to a breast infection if it’s severe. Breast Engorgement Causes Your breasts may naturally become engorged soon after you give birth as your milk comes in. It can also happen if you aren’t able to breastfeed or pump often enough. Breastfeeding has many benefits for mother and baby alike. But it isn’t always easy. It may take your body a while to get used to it. And for some women, it might not work out. A lactation consultant or your doctor can help you get started. Breast Engorgement Treatment and Home Remedies Engorgement can be painful and can cause trouble with your little one latching on. You may not want to breastfeed or pump. But that's the only way to make it go away. Sometimes engorgement can make your breasts feel hard to the touch. That's all the milk backed up in the breast tissue. If you're breastfeeding , this can make it tough for your baby to latch on or create a painful and improper latch. Pump or manually express milk first, then try again. You can also try to reduce the hardness in your breasts by massaging them, taking a warm shower, or applying a warm compress to your breasts before feeding. If that doesn't work, don't keep trying. The warmth may increase the swelling instead and prevent the milk from flowing. Once you get some milk out, the engorgement should go away. Then your baby will be able to latch and transfer the rest of the milk, emptying the breast. Once your body understands how much milk your baby needs and gets into a rhythm, engorgement shouldn't be an issue. If you still feel that tightness and pain , try these tips and talk to your doctor. If you have fever, discharge from the nipple, or body aches, you should also talk with your doctor. You could also check in with a lactation consultant . You can also do these: Switch to a bra with more support. Take over-the-counter pain medication (consult with your baby's doctor beforehand). Try ice packs to reduce swelling. Try reverse pressure softening, where you gently press on the area around your nipple for about a minute to try to shift some of the engorged fluid away from that area. Breast Engorgement Prevention The key is to not let your breasts get overly full with milk. Feed your baby whenever they are hungry. Breastfeed or pump often or as close to every 2-3 hours to set a routine. Pump if you skip a feeding, have given a bottle, or if your baby doesn't take enough milk or empty the breast enough. It can help to use a warm compress or take a warm shower before you breastfeed or express your milk. Make sure you stay hydrated and eat a healthy diet, too. If You’re Formula Feeding Your body takes its cues from you. If milk isn't leaving your body, it will stop making more. If your breasts are engorged when your milk comes in and you are planning to formula feed, wear a tighter sports bra and curb any kind of stimulation to the breast. After some days, the engorgement will steadily decline."
69,What Is Mastitis?,"On a good day, your breasts can feel tender. They're always out on the front lines, taking the brunt of every afternoon jog and pouncing toddler. They don't get infected often, but when they do, it can hurt like no bad bra or PMS pain ever has. The catchall name for an infection of the breast tissue is mastitis. If you're breastfeeding, it's called lactation or puerperal mastitis. If you're not, it's called periductal mastitis. Mastitis can make you feel like you have the flu, but it can be cured a lot quicker. Causes Mastitis is a common condition in women who breastfeed. As many as 1 in 10 breastfeeding women in the U.S. get it. It's caused by a backup of milk in the milk ducts. This happens when your baby isn't sucking or attaching properly, or favors one breast over the other. Mastitis can also happen if you don't feed or pump regularly. It is more common in the first three months of lactation. Breastfeeding women aren't the only ones who get mastitis. If you're not breastfeeding, a cracked nipple or nipple piercing can cause the breast infection. Both allow bacteria to get into the milk ducts. This is especially common in women who smoke. Symptoms Just like any other infection, the tissue around the infected area becomes inflamed to keep it from spreading to other parts of the body. With mastitis, the infected milk duct causes the breast to swell. Your breast may look red and feel tender or warm. Many women with mastitis feel like they have the flu , including achiness, chills, and a fever of 101 F or higher. You may also have discharge from your nipple or feel a hard lump in your breast. Diagnosis The symptoms of mastitis can come on very suddenly. You may feel like you're getting the flu before you feel any discomfort in your breast. When you feel that pain or see the telltale redness, call your doctor as soon as possible. Your doctor can diagnose mastitis based on a physical exam. The fever and chills give it away, as does a red, wedge-shaped area on the breast that points toward the nipple. There are two things to rule out: a breast abscess, which happens when mastitis isn't treated quickly, and inflammatory breast cancer , which is rare and shares the symptoms of redness and swelling. Treatment Whether or not you're breastfeeding, antibiotics should have you feeling better in a day or two. Take them as directed. If you are breastfeeding, continue drinking lots of water, wearing loose bras, and resting as much as you can. Your doctor may suggest ibuprofen, or something like it, to take care of the fever and pain. It's important to keep breastfeeding and move that milk in and out of the ducts. Continue expressing milk if it is too painful to feed from the breast. Prevention Tight bras and clothing put pressure on your breasts. Keep things light and loose. To keep milk from backing up, make sure your baby attaches correctly, and get all the milk out of each breast during every feeding. Or, make sure you are pumping to express the milk on a routine schedule. A lactation consultant can help if you need support."
70,Breast Lumps: Causes and When to Call a Doctor,"You notice that something is different with your breast , and you find a lump. Now what? If you notice any breast changes, call your doctor right away to get it checked, but don't panic. Most breast lumps are benign, which means they're not cancer. Benign breast lumps usually have smooth edges and can be moved slightly when you push against them. They are often found in both breasts . There are several common causes, including normal changes in breast tissue, breast cysts or adenomas, injury, or rarely, breast infection s. Breast tissue changes during a woman's entire life. It is sensitive to changing hormone levels during the menstrual cycle. Common Causes of Breast Lumps Fibroadenomas . These are the most common benign lumps. If you push on them, they are solid, round, rubbery lumps that move freely. They’re usually painless. Women between 20 and 30 get them most often. They’re also more common in African-American women. Fibroadenomas can be surgically removed. Fibrocystic changes . Changes in hormones during your menstrual cycles can create changes in your breasts. These are known as fibrocystic breast changes. You could get lumps in both breasts that increase in size and tenderness just before your period. You might have nipple discharge as well. The lumps are milk ducts and tissues around them that have grown and widened to form cysts. These  enlarge quickly in response to hormones released near your period. The lumps may be hard or rubbery and could feel like a single (large or small) lump. Fibrocystic changes can also cause breast tissue to thicken. These changes are often most noticeable during your 40s. They’re the most common cause of benign breast lumps in women ages 35 to 50. Postmenopausal women are less likely to have these types of breast changes. That’s because they don’t have monthly changes in hormones. They don’t require treatment, but your doctor may recommend ways to ease monthly tenderness. Simple cysts . Simple cysts are fluid-filled sacs that usually affect both breasts. You could have one or many. They can vary in size. Their tenderness and size often change with your menstrual cycle. Simple cysts can be treated with fine needle aspiration . This isn’t surgery. Your doctor will place a needle into the area around the lump. If the lump is a cyst, they can suck out the fluid and the cyst will collapse. Cysts can also go away on their own, so your doctor may choose to wait and see if it goes away. Intraductal papillomas . These are small, wart -like growths in the lining of the mammary duct near the nipple. They usually affect women who are 30 to 50. They can cause bleeding from the nipple. Your doctor can remove them with surgery. Traumatic fat necrosis . This happens when there is an injury to the breast, though you may not remember an injury happening. It causes fat to form in lumps that are generally round, firm, hard, and painless. You usually get one at a time. It can be hard to tell if a lump from traumatic fat necrosis is that or something else until your doctor does a biopsy . These usually don’t need to be treated. But if the lump bothers you, the doctor can remove it. How Often Are Breast Lumps Cancerous? About 20% of the time, breast lumps are cancer.  Still, remember that it's more common for them to be a cyst (a sac) or a fibroadenoma (an abnormal growth that's not cancer). Some lumps come and go during a woman's menstrual cycle. Can Men Get Breast Lumps? Yes. Men can have tender breast enlargement, often with a lump under the nipple. Sometimes this is in one breast, but it often happens in both. This noncancerous condition is called gynecomastia . Does a Breast Lump Mean Infection? It can. Sometimes a painful lump, with or without redness, is the first sign of an infection. Mastitis is an infection most common in breastfeeding moms. It happens when bacteria get into the mammary ducts through your nipple. Infection happens in small pockets. You’ll feel tender, warm lumps in your breast. For relief, try a hot shower and let the warm water flow over your breasts. A warm compress can also help. Sometimes your doctor will prescribe an antibiotic. What Should I Do If I Find a Breast Lump? See your doctor if you discover any new breast changes, such as: An area that’s clearly different from any other area on either breast A lump or thickened area in or near the breast or underarm that lasts through your menstrual cycle A change in breast size, shape, or contour A mass or lump. It could be as small as a pea or feel like a marble under your skin . A change in how the skin on your breast or nipple looks or feels. It could be dimpled, puckered, scaly, or inflamed. Clear or bloody fluid coming out of the nipple Red skin on your breast or nipple What Will Happen at My Appointment? The doctor will ask questions about your health history. They’ll perform a breast exam to feel for lumps or other changes in the breast tissue and under your arms. If there’s fluid coming out of your nipple, the doctor may order blood tests to check hormone levels and collect a sample to check for abnormal cells. They may also do a mammogram or ultrasound to see if the lump is solid or filled with fluid. Your doctor may order a test called a biopsy. They’ll take a tiny sample of the lump with a needle or small cut and send it to a lab. How Do I Monitor My Breasts Health? Self-examination and mammograms are the most common ways to monitor your breast health. Your doctor can help you decide the right time to start and how often to get a mammogram. The American Cancer Society recommends women ages 45 to 54 at average risk for breast cancer get yearly screening. Women 55 and older can switch to getting a mammogram every other year or continue with the yearly screening tests. Women ages 40 to 44 can start a yearly mammogram. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening mammograms every other year for women ages 50-74. If you have a high risk for breast cancer , get a mammogram every year. You may start getting them at a younger age, too. You may also get ultrasound screenings, too. Breast MRI screening tests, in addition to mammograms, is sometimes used in certain women with a high risk of breast cancer. Talk with your doctor to decide what's best for you."
71,Why Do My Breasts Hurt?,"Soreness, swelling, heaviness, shooting or burning pangs, tightness -- whatever the feeling, breast pain hurts. It can be troubling too -- it’s very common to wonder if what you’re feeling might be a sign of breast cancer . Doctors call breast pain “mastalgia.” It’s important to track the cause of it. But know that pain in either or both of your breasts in itself isn’t a sign of breast cancer . Breast tenderness and other discomfort can happen for lots of different reasons. This article examines the most common ones. Cyclical Breast Pain Your breast pain is likely cyclical -- meaning it’s linked to your reproductive cycle -- if you have some of these signs: The pain feels achy and heavy Your breasts swell or seem lumpy Both breasts are affected, mainly the upper and outer areas. Sometimes, the pain can radiate to your armpits You’re in your childbearing years (around your 20s and 30s), or you’re approaching menopause To help ease cyclical breast pain, your doctor might recommend you take oral contraceptives, or they may tweak the dosage you already take. They might also suggest you cut back on caffeine , or try over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen , ibuprofen , or naproxen sodium. Hormone Levels Most breast pain seems to relate to the levels of two hormones -- estrogen and progesterone -- in your body. Doctors aren’t sure what triggers breast pain. It can happen at different times in your reproductive life, such as during: Puberty Your monthly period or when you have premenstrual syndrome (PMS) Pregnancy , usually in the first trimester Breastfeeding . Sometimes a blocked milk duct can get infected, a painful condition called mastitis . It needs to be treated immediately, usually with antibiotics . Menopause Sore nipples can be a sign that your period is coming. That pain, along with other breast pain should ease once you have your period. Pregnancy can also cause your nipples to get tender and swell. Breastfeeding Breastfeeding itself can cause nipple pain as your baby latches on to them. It may feel like a sharp pinch. It could also cause your nipples to crack and bleed. You can ease the soreness with things like ointments, or even rubbing a few drops of milk over your nipples to soften them before you start. Fibrocystic Breast Changes This is likely linked to hormones, as well. Fibrous tissue (breast tissue that’s scar-like or ropey) and cysts (fluid-filled sacs) form in your breasts. It can be painful, but it’s normal and usually harmless. About half of women in their 20s to 50s get it. You don’t need treatment unless your symptoms are severe. Fatty Acid Imbalance These acids are found in vegetable and animals oils. If there’s an imbalance of them in your cells, your breasts can be more sensitive to hormones. To reduce your symptoms, try cutting down the fat in your diet . Your doctor might also recommend a diet high in complex carbs. Some doctors think taking evening primrose oil helps correct fatty acid imbalances too. Noncyclical Breast Pain Breast pain also can be triggered by reasons other than hormones. Yours might be linked to another issue if: Your pain feels like soreness, burning, or tightness Discomfort is constant (or unpredictable) Pain seems to affect one breast in a particular area You’ve passed menopause Extramammary Breast Pain This pain feels like it’s coming from your breasts. But it’s actually radiating from somewhere else, often the chest wall. Usually, the pain gets better with rest, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory meds (NSAIDs), and sometimes cortisone injections. If you strain your pectoralis major muscle (that’s located beneath and around your breasts) it also can feel like your breasts are the source of the pain. This can result from activities like lifting, raking, and shoveling. Infection Though mastitis usually occurs in women who are breastfeeding, it can happen at any age. If your clothes chafe against your nipples, that also can irritate them. It can let in bacteria that may lead to infection. Thrush -- a yeast infection of the breast and nipple -- can feel like a stabbing, shooting, or burning in your nipples. You might also see redness, or dry or flaky skin . Injury Trauma to a particular area of your breast -- such as from having surgery or getting implants -- can cause breast pain. Sometimes an injury can cause a breast vein to swell and a blood clot to form. Though painful, it’s usually not serious. Medications Certain prescription meds, as well as hormone medications, can cause breast pain. These include some heart medications and psychiatric drugs. Skin Conditions If you have skin irritation called dermatitis, you might have a rash or swelling around your nipple. The term ""dermatitis"" includes conditions like eczema and contact dermatitis . Talk with your doctor about what might cause these skin problems and how you can treat them. Support Issues Women with large, heavy breasts can suffer pain from stretched ligaments and breast tissue. It can hurt not only in your breasts, but in your back, neck, and shoulders, as well. Reduction surgery can help, but it, too, can cause pain if tissue is damaged during the operation. A supportive, sturdy bra can help keep your breasts in place. Wearing a sports bra to bed and when exercising can also help."
72,Understanding Breast Problems -- The Basics,"The female breast is an organ that changes with puberty, with the monthly menstrual cycle, and with pregnancy. It also continues to change with age. Most changes in your breasts are perfectly normal and no cause for concern. But some changes need medical attention. Chief among these are breast pain and lumps. Breast Lumps Breast lumps come in many forms, including cysts, adenomas, and papillomas. They differ in size, shape, and location, as well as in causes and treatment. About half of all women have lumpy breasts, or fibrocystic change. They are more common during the premenstrual period and usually disappear after menopause. Most lumps are benign and do not signal cancer ; however, any time you find a new or unusual lump, have your doctor check it to make sure it is not precancerous or cancerous. Researchers are studying the incidence of breast lumps in women using hormone replacement therapy (HRT). In combination HRT, women take the hormones estrogen and progestin to ease the symptoms of menopause . In 2002, a study called the Women’s Health Initiative discovered that HRT often resulted in more harm than good. Taking both hormones was shown to increase the risk of breast cancer and change the breast's structure, increasing breast density and making mammograms harder to read. This could make finding cancer more difficult. To put this into numbers, if 10,000 women took combined HRT for a year, this would add up to about 8 more cases of breast cancer per year than if they had not taken hormone therapy (HT). Cysts, which can be large or small, are often harmless, fluid-filled sacs that may be painful. After menopause , many cysts shrink or disappear. You should immediately have your doctor check any lumps that form after menopause. Fibroadenomas are the most common benign breast tumors in women under 25 and occasionally in adolescents. These tumors are usually round, several centimeters across, and mobile. They tend to regress after menopause. Your doctor may recommend removal if the lump persists, gets larger, or if you are anxious about it. Tests will be done to check for cancer when it is removed. Nipple adenomas are tumors of the nipple area. They vary in appearance, sometimes come back after being removed, and are sometimes associated with cancer. An intraductal papilloma is an uncommon small growth in the lining of the milk ducts near the nipple. Usually seen in women over 40, papillomas produce a discharge, which may be bloody. Breast Self-Exams and Mammograms The ACS states that research has not shown a clear benefit of performing regular breast self-exams. If you decide to perform breast self-exams, your doctor should go over how to perform them with you. Premenstrual changes can cause temporary thickening in breast tissue that disappears after your period, so your doctor may tell you to wait until a few days after your period to do them. A breast self-exam is easiest in the shower, using soap to smooth your skin . Look for dimpling. Using light pressure, check for lumps near the surface. Use firm pressure to explore deeper tissues. Squeeze each nipple gently; if there is any discharge -- especially if it is bloody -- consult your doctor. Any time you find a new or unusual lump in your breast, have your doctor check it to make sure it is not cancer. Most lumps are harmless. The best test for distinguishing a cyst from a solid tumor is ultrasound ; a needle biopsy may also be done. Mammograms -- detailed X-ray pictures of the breasts -- can reveal tumors too tiny to be felt by hand. There is disagreement as to when a woman should start getting mammograms: Some doctors say age 40; others say not until age 50. The American Cancer Society recommends women ages 40 to 44 should have a choice to start yearly screening mammograms if they would like. Women ages 45 to 54 should have a mammogram each year. and those 55 years and over should continue getting mammograms every 1 to 2 years.. The USPSTF recommends routine screening for women starting at 50. If you have a family history of breast cancer , especially in your mother or sister, your doctor may want you to start them earlier. Three-dimensional mammograms, to be used along with traditional digital mammograms , are also available in some screening centers. Breast Pain Breast pain can have many causes, including the normal swelling of breast tissue during the menstrual cycle. Other causes include infection or injury; growths, including cancer; and perhaps diet. The general swelling of breast tissue with your period can be painful, but it is not dangerous, and no treatment is necessary if you can tolerate the discomfort. Each monthly cycle brings about changes in hormones, including more estrogen and progesterone , that bring more fluid into the breasts, expanding tissue, stretching nerve fibers, and causing pain. Some women have this painful swelling just before their periods, with symptoms easing near the end of the menstrual flow. Others have it as a side effect of birth control pills . Trauma and infection in the breast have the same symptoms you would see elsewhere in your body. Infections tend to become walled off from surrounding tissue, producing small abscesses. This may give them the appearance of cysts. If you think you have an infection, see your doctor. Your doctor will usually prescribe antibiotics , although many times the infection will come back and may require the removal of the infected tissue. Cysts may produce pain, but breast cancer rarely does -- although pain does not rule out the possibility of cancer."
73,Breast Reconstruction,"If you’ve had a mastectomy because of breast cancer , you may choose to have reconstructive plastic surgery . It can restore balance between the two breasts by replacing skin , breast tissue, and the removed nipple. The amount of reconstruction will depend on the mastectomy and the width, size, and location of the removed tumor. Is Breast Reconstruction Right for Me? The idea of living without a breast or without part of one affects each woman differently. It’s a personal decision, and it's often not easy to make. You don’t have to have reconstruction. You can wear external breast forms or pads, or change nothing at all. Plastic surgery now gives better results than ever before. You can have breast reconstruction using breast implants or your own tissue. The operation changes your appearance, but it can have psychological benefits as well. It can add to a sense of wellness for you and your family. Is It Cosmetic Surgery? Restoring a breast isn’t considered a cosmetic procedure. It’s reconstructive surgery. Since it’s considered part of the treatment of a disease, the law says insurance providers must provide coverage. When’s the Best Time to Have Breast Reconstruction? The timing is based on what you want to do, your medical conditions, and your cancer treatment . You can have it done during the operation to remove the breast, or you can have it months or years after a mastectomy. If you've started chemotherapy or radiation treatments, reconstruction is usually put off until they’re finished. Your surgeon can help you decide the best timing for you. What Are the Different Reconstruction Options? Before you decide, you and your doctor will need to discuss your wants and needs, your medical condition, and any previous surgery. Implants involve stretching the skin with a tissue expander that goes inside your body and then inserting a silicone-gel or saline (saltwater) implant weeks later. The tissue expander is filled to a certain volume by adding saline, usually once a week for a few sessions. You may have some pain, but many women are pleased with the final result. Implants can rupture, causing pain and infection. You may need surgery to remove or replace them. TRAM flap procedures use the tissue from a woman’s abdomen to create a mound to reconstruct the breast. In general, this means cutting away at least some of your stomach muscles, fat and blood supply to use for the reconstruction. Sometimes, the tissue that’s being moved is kept attached to its blood supply. This is called a pedicle or tunneling procedure. The flap has a better chance of surviving because the blood supply remains in place, but the breast may not look exactly the way you want. In a free-flap procedure, the tissue is disconnected and then attached to a blood supply near the new location. This is a more complicated procedure. The biggest risk is that the blood vessels may get clogged and the flap might die. The benefit is that the reconstruction looks more like a natural breast. A new version of the procedure, called the muscle sparing free TRAM flap, cuts away far less abdominal muscle. This often makes for a quicker recovery and less risk of losing core strength after surgery. For all TRAM surgeries, you can expect a scar across your belly from one hip to the other, typically below the bikini line. You might also notice a flatter and tighter stomach because of the missing fat, skin, and muscle. The surgery lasts from 4 to 8 hours and you usually stay in the hospital for about 5 days total. Your health care provider will give you detailed instructions on how best to care for your surgical wounds after surgery. It should take 6 to 8 weeks to fully recover from your surgery. Though it’s the most common flap procedure, TRAM flap isn't for everyone. It may not be for you if you: Have had numerous prior surgeries in the belly area Are especially thin or don’t have enough extra belly tissue Are concerned about losing core strength, especially in lower abdomen In addition, talk to your doctor if you plan to become pregnant as the TRAM surgeries could be a problem in some cases. Other, less common tissue flap procedures use tissue from different areas. Taking tissue from the back is called a latissimus dorsi flap. Aesthetic flat closure (AFS) may be considered. This is a surgical repair procedure that removes or rearranges excess breast skin and fat after a mastectomy. This corrects contour deformities and can be done at the time of mastectomy or as a second procedure. If needed, fat grafting can also be done for the best cosmetic outcome. The shape, feel, and contour of a breast made from a woman's own tissue are more like those of a natural breast. But flap surgery is more involved than implant surgery. And, as with all major surgeries, you could have complications, such as bleeding, infection, or poor healing. You may want to think about nipple reconstruction, too. Usually, the nipple and areola (the dark area around the nipple) are removed during the mastectomy to lower the chance of cancer returning. Nipple reconstruction is typically an outpatient procedure done with local anesthesia. You may have it after breast reconstruction. This allows the new tissue to heal and settle into place. Your doctor can make small changes in size and position of the breast when the nipple and areola are rebuilt. Surgeons can make a nipple out of tissue taken from the back or abdominal flap. It’s then tattooed to resemble the color of a nipple. In rare cases, the nipple from the original breast can be reattached, but only if the surgeon is convinced that the tissue is cancer-free. Because of a lack of nerve connections, the nipple won’t rise or flatten in response to touch or temperature. A prosthetic nipple is another option. The plastic surgeon makes a copy of your natural nipple and colors the areola. It can be glued to the breast and re-glued every week or so. How Long Does Breast Reconstruction Surgery Take? Preparation for the procedure, including anesthesia, may take 2 hours. The reconstruction will take 1 to 6 hours. After the surgery, you'll spend about 2 to 3 hours in recovery before being transferred to a hospital room. Recovery From Breast Reconstruction Surgery You may have some discomfort for the first few days afterward. You’ll get pain medication as needed. Throughout your hospital stay, the staff will closely watch you. Soon after surgery, you’ll be encouraged to move your arms, but not for any forceful activity like pulling yourself up, getting out of bed, or lifting heavy objects. Nurses will help you in and out of bed. The day after surgery, you may be able to sit in a chair beside the bed. On the second day, most patients are walking without help. You’ll probably get IV fluids for a day or two. You may have a urinary catheter overnight or until you can walk to the bathroom. And where the surgeon made cuts (the incision sites), you’ll have drains. If you go home with these drains in place, you’ll get instructions on how to care for them. The length of your hospital stay depends on the type of operation and how your recovery goes. If you got implants, the average hospital stay is 1 to 2 days. Flap procedures may require a stay of 5 to 6 days. Follow-Up Care for Breast Reconstruction After you go home, you can expect some soreness, swelling, and bruising for 2 to 3 weeks. You may be told to put medications on the suture area or change bandages at home. Your plastic surgeon will advise you about showering, bathing, and wound care. Most women return to regular activities within 6 to 8 weeks after surgery. It may be several weeks before you can do strenuous exercise . The mastectomy and breast reconstruction will leave areas of numbness where the surgery was done. Instead of pain where the tissue was taken, you may feel numbness and tightness. In time, some feeling may return to your breasts. Most scars will fade over time. The shape of your reconstructed breast will slowly improve. You'll need regular checkups at first. If you have a temporary expander, it will be expanded with saline once a week, on average, until the desired size is reached (usually within six to 10 office visits). Keep doing self-exams of your breasts every month, and have an annual mammogram. Breast reconstruction doesn’t change the chance of cancer coming back, and it generally doesn’t interfere with treatment. If the disease does come back, your medical team can still treat you with surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy. What Are the Possible Side Effects? Infection at the surgery site. As with any surgery, infection is a risk. An antibiotic will usually get rid of the infection. Pain and discomfort. Your doctor will advise you on a pain relief medication. Some women have more pain than others. Itching . The wound will itch as it heals. But no matter how strong the urge, avoid scratching it. Your doctor can recommend an ointment or cream to calm the itching. Numbness or tingling. You may have these sensations because the nerves have been affected. They can last up to 12 months after surgery. Fluid collection under the wound. Fluid may build up under the wound, even after your drainage tubes are removed several days after the operation. If there’s not much fluid, it may go away by itself. But if there’s a lot, your surgeon may have to drain the site using a needle and syringe. Call your doctor right away if you have any of the following: A fever above 100 F Fluid leaking from incision sites Any change in color in the breast or scar area Increased pain or swelling in the surgical areas"
74,Breath-Holding Spells in Children: What to Know,"If your young child reacts to sudden pain or upset by not breathing, turning blue or pale, and then fainting , they may have just had a breath-holding spell. When this happens, it can be scary and can cause a parent to worry. Also called breath-holding attacks, these spells are somewhat common and can happen in healthy children. They can look like seizures , but they’re not. The spells don’t hurt the children, and many outgrow them by age 6 or 7. They are most common in 2-year-olds. Breath-holding spells come in two types. With cyanotic spells, a child’s face turns blue. With pallid spells, they become pale. Cyanotic spells are more common. Causes Often, a breath-holding attack starts with crying in reaction to pain, fear, or anger. If your child has a cyanotic spell, they're probably upset or frustrated about something. May be they got into trouble or wants something they can’t have. They’ll cry, exhale very hard, but not breathe in again. Their face, especially around their lips, quickly will turn blue, and they’ll pass out. With a pallid spell, they likely felt a sudden pain or scare. They may have fallen backwards and bumped their head or been spooked when someone snuck up behind them. They may shout in hurt or surprise, or they may open their mouth to shout but no sounds comes out. They’ll then stop breathing, color will drain from their face, and they’ll be out. In both cases, your child will start to breathe again within a minute and come to on their own. They may be tired , but other than that, they’ll be their normal self. Your child doesn’t have these spells on purpose. It’s their body’s involuntary response to a sudden event. The reflexes change your child’s breathing pattern, heart rate , and blood pressure levels, which make your child faint. Symptoms After your child passes out, they’ll lie limply on the floor. They may also: Arch their back Become stiff Jerk their body a few times Turn sweaty Wet themself They may or may not gasp when they start to breathe again. Diagnosis After your child’s first breath-holding spell, take them to their doctor to rule out any health problems. There are no tests to confirm a breath-holding spell. Your pediatrician usually can diagnose it after hearing what happened. They’ll want to know what set it off, how your child looked, and how they started to breathe again. Rarely, the pediatrician may refer your child to a heart doctor, called a cardiologist , or to a neurologist , who specializes in the brain and the nervous system , to check for any underlying causes. Treatment If your child has one breath-holding spell, they’ll likely have more. Some children have them several times a day, while others may have just one in a year. There are no drugs or other treatments for these spells. Some studies suggest that anemia , or low levels of red blood cells , may be a culprit and that iron supplements may help. But more research is needed. The best thing to do is let your child lie on their side while they're out. That helps the blood flow to their brain and gives them a chance to recover more quickly. In very rare cases, a child may not start breathing again after 1 minute. If this happens, call 911. If they're still not breathing after 3 minutes, start CPR . Prevention Your child’s doctor may teach you how to spot triggers that cause the spells, so you may prevent them. Sometimes, blowing hard on your baby ’s face can interrupt a breath-holding spell. But this won’t work for every baby , and it may not work for older children. If temper tantrums set off breath-holding attacks, your doctor may help you figure out a new way to set limits for your child. Take care not to give in to your child just to avoid a spell. This can lead to behavior problems that may last even after they're outgrown their breath-holding spells."
75,Understanding Labor and Delivery Complications,"What Are Common Labor and Delivery Complications? A pregnancy that has gone smoothly can still have problems when it's time to deliver the baby. Your doctor and hospital are prepared to handle them. Here are some of the most common concerns: Preterm labor and premature delivery One of the greatest dangers babies face is being born too early, before their body is mature enough to survive outside the womb. The lungs , for example, may not be able to breathe air, or the baby's body may not generate enough heat to keep warm. A full-term pregnancy lasts about 40 weeks. Having labor contractions before 37 weeks of pregnancy is called preterm labor. Also, a baby born before 37 weeks is considered a premature baby who is at risk of complications of prematurity, such as immature lungs, respiratory distress, and digestive problems. Drugs and other treatments can be used to stop preterm labor . If these treatments fail, intensive care can keep many premature babies alive. The symptoms of preterm labor and birth include: Contractions before 37 weeks of pregnancy , with a tightening and hardening of the uterine muscle, 10 minutes apart or less (these may be painless) Cramps similar to menstrual cramps (not to be mistaken with Braxton Hicks contractions, which typically are not at regular intervals and do not open the cervix) Low backache A feeling of pelvic pressure Abdominal cramps, gas, or diarrhea ; in combination with contractions, may signal preterm labor Vaginal spotting or bleeding A change in quality or quantity of vaginal discharge , especially any gush or leak of fluid Call your doctor if you notice or feel any of those symptoms. Protracted labor Protracted labor refers to cervical dilation that is abnormally slow or to abnormally slow fetal descent. This means the labor does not progress as fast as it should. This could happen with a big baby, a baby in a breech position (buttocks down), or other abnormal presentation, or with a uterus that does not contract strongly enough. Often, there is no specific cause for protracted labor. Both the mother and the baby are at risk for several complications, including infections, if the amniotic sac has been ruptured for a long time and the birth doesn't follow. If labor goes on too long, the doctor may give IV fluids to prevent you from getting dehydrated. If the uterus does not contract enough, they may give you oxytocin, a drug that promotes stronger contractions . And if the cervix stops dilating despite strong contractions of the uterus, a C-section may be necessary. Abnormal presentation ""Presentation"" refers to the part of the baby that will appear first from the birth canal. In the weeks before your due date , the fetus usually drops lower in the uterus. Ideally, for labor, the baby is positioned head-down, facing the mother's back, with its chin tucked to its chest and the back of the head ready to enter the pelvis. That way, the smallest part of the baby's head leads the way through the cervix and into the birth canal. This normal presentation is called vertex (head down) occiput anterior. Because the head is the largest and least flexible part of the baby, it's best for the head to lead the way into the birth canal. That way, there's little risk that the baby's body will make it through the birth canal, but the head will get caught. Some babies present with their buttocks or feet pointed down toward the birth canal. This is called a breech presentation. Breech presentations are often seen during an ultrasound exam far before the due date, but most babies will turn to the normal head-down presentation as they get closer to the due date. Types of breech presentation include: Frank breech. In a frank breech, the baby's buttocks lead the way into the pelvis; the hips are flexed, the knees extended. Complete breech. In a complete breech, both knees and hips are flexed, and the baby's buttocks or feet may enter the birth canal first. Incomplete breech. In an incomplete or footling breech, one or both feet lead the way. Transverse lie is another type of presentation problem. A few babies lie horizontally in the uterus, called a transverse lie, which usually means the baby's shoulder will lead the way into the birth canal rather than the head. In cephalopelvic disproportion, the baby's head is too large to fit through the mother's pelvis, either because of the size or because of the baby's poor positioning. Sometimes the baby is not facing the mother's back, but instead is turned toward their abdomen (occiput or cephalic posterior). This increases the chance of a lengthy, painful, childbirth , often called ""back labor,"" or tearing of the birth canal. In malpresentation, the baby is not ""presenting"" or positioned in the normal way. In malpresentation of the head, the baby's head is positioned wrong, with the forehead, top of the head, or face entering the birth canal, instead of the back of its head. Sometimes a placenta previa (when the placenta blocks the cervix) may cause an abnormal presentation. But many times the cause is not known. Abnormal presentations increase a woman's risk for uterine or birth canal injuries and abnormal labor. Breech babies are at an increased risk of injury and a prolapsed umbilical cord, which cuts off the baby's blood supply. A transverse lie is the most serious abnormal presentation, and it can lead to injury of the uterus, as well as injury to the fetus . Toward the end of your third trimester , your doctor will check the baby's presentation and position by feeling your belly or with an ultrasound . If the fetus remains in breech presentation several weeks before the due date , your doctor may attempt to ""turn"" the baby into the correct position in a procedure called an ""external version."" One way to try to turn the baby after 36 weeks is an external cephalic version, which involves a doctor manually rotating the baby by placing their hands on the mother's belly and turning the baby. These manipulations work about 50% to 60% of the time and are usually more successful on women who have given birth previously because their uteruses stretch more easily. The procedure typically takes place in the hospital, in case an emergency C-section becomes necessary. To make the procedure easier to perform, safer for the baby, and more tolerable for the mother-to-be, doctors sometimes give a uterine muscle relaxant and then use an ultrasound and electronic fetal monitor as guides. If the first attempt is unsuccessful, turning the baby may be tried again with an epidural pain medication to help relax the uterine muscles. Since not all doctors have been trained to do versions, you may be referred to another obstetrician . There is a very small risk that the maneuver could cause the baby's umbilical cord to become entangled or the placenta to separate from the uterus. There's also a chance (about 4%) that the baby might flip back into a breech position before delivery, so some doctors induce labor immediately. The closer you are to your due date, the lower the risk of reverting back to a breech position. But the bigger the baby, the harder it is to turn. The procedure can be uncomfortable for the mother, but if successful, may avoid a C-section, which is more likely if the baby can't be moved into the proper position. Premature rupture of membranes (PROM) Normally, the membranes surrounding the baby in the uterus break and release amniotic fluid (known as the ""water breaking"") either right before or during labor. Premature rupture of membranes means that these membranes have ruptured too early in pregnancy, meaning prior to the onset of labor. This exposes the baby to a high risk of infection. If the baby is mature enough to be born, your doctor will induce labor or do a C-section if necessary. If the baby isn't mature enough, you may be given antibiotics to prevent infection as well as other medications to try to prevent or slow preterm PROM. Umbilical cord prolapse The umbilical cord is your baby's lifeline. You pass oxygen and other nutrients from your body to your baby through the umbilical cord and placenta. Sometimes, before or during labor, the umbilical cord can slip through the cervix after your water breaks, preceding the baby into the birth canal. The cord may even protrude from the vagina -- a dangerous situation because the blood flow through the umbilical cord can become blocked or stopped. You may feel the cord in the birth canal if it prolapses, and may see the cord if it protrudes from your vagina . Umbilical cord prolapse happens more often when a baby is small, preterm, in breech presentation, or if its head hasn't entered the mother's pelvis yet. Cord prolapse can also occur if the amniotic sac breaks before the baby has moved into position in the pelvis. Umbilical cord prolapse is an emergency. If you aren't at the hospital when it happens, call an ambulance to take you there. Until help arrives, get on your hands and knees , with your chest on the floor and your buttocks raised. In this position, gravity will help keep the baby from pressing against the cord and cutting off their blood and oxygen supply. Once you get to the hospital, a C-section will be performed. Umbilical cord compression Because the fetus moves and kicks inside the uterus, the umbilical cord can wrap and unwrap itself around the baby many times throughout pregnancy. While there are ""cord accidents"" in which the cord gets twisted around and blocks the blood supply to the baby, this is extremely rare and can't be prevented. Sometimes the umbilical cord gets stretched and compressed during labor, leading to a brief decrease in blood flow to the fetus. This can cause sudden, short drops in fetal heart rate, called variable decelerations, which are usually picked up by monitors during labor. Cord compression happens in about one in 10 deliveries. In most cases, these heart rate changes are of no major concern, and the birth proceeds normally. But a C-section may be necessary if the baby's heart rate worsens or the baby shows other signs of distress. Umbilical cord compression can occur if the cord becomes wrapped around the baby's neck or a limb or gets pressed between the baby's head and the mother's pelvic bone. You may be given oxygen to increase the oxygen available to your baby. Your doctor may hurry along the delivery by using forceps or vacuum assistance, or, in some cases, delivering the baby by C-section. Amniotic fluid embolism This is one of the most serious complications of labor and delivery . Very rarely, a small amount of amniotic fluid -- the fluid that surrounds the fetus in the uterus -- enters the mother's bloodstream, usually during a particularly difficult labor or a C-section. The fluid travels to the woman's lungs and may cause the arteries in the lungs to constrict. For the mother, this constriction can result in a rapid heart rate, irregular heart rhythm, collapse, shock, or even cardiac arrest and death. Widespread blood clotting is a common complication, requiring emergency care. Preeclampsia Preeclampsia is a complication of pregnancy involving high blood pressure that develops after 20 weeks of pregnancy or shortly after delivery. Preeclampsia may lead to premature detachment of the placenta from the uterus, maternal seizure, or stroke . Uterine bleeding (Postpartum hemorrhage) After a baby is delivered, excessive bleeding from the uterus, cervix, or vagina, called postpartum hemorrhage, can be a major concern. Excessive bleeding may result when the contractions of the uterus after delivery are impaired, and the blood vessels that opened when the placenta detached from the wall of the uterus continue to bleed. It can also result from other causes such as cervical or vaginal lacerations. Post-term pregnancy and post-maturity In most pregnancies that go a little beyond 41 to 42 weeks, called late-term pregnancy, there are usually no problems. But problems may develop if the placenta can no longer provide enough nourishment to maintain a healthy environment for the baby. The risks can become significant in post-term pregnancies, those that go to 42 weeks or more. How Do I Prevent Problems With Labor and Delivery? The most important thing you can do to try to have a healthy baby is getting early and adequate prenatal care. The best prenatal care begins even before you are pregnant, so you can be in the best of health before pregnancy. To help prevent complications, if you smoke, quit. Smoking can trigger preterm labor. Researchers have found a link between gum disease and preterm birth, so brush and floss your teeth daily. It may also be helpful to reduce your stress level by setting aside quiet time every day and asking for help when you need it. Transvaginal ultrasound Your doctor will check you for risk factors for preterm labor and premature delivery, and discuss any precautions you should take. Measuring the length of the cervix using a transvaginal ultrasound probe can help predict a woman's risk of delivering prematurely. This procedure is usually done in a doctor's office between 20 and 28 weeks of pregnancy for women who may be at risk. Fetal fibronectin testing Fetal fibronectin testing can also be used as a possible predictor of preterm labor for women who may be at risk. This test is done like a Pap smear, and test results are used to predict your risk of preterm labor. The fetal fibronectin test can't tell for sure if you're in preterm labor, but it can tell you if you're not. A woman at risk for premature delivery can be forewarned about what to do if preterm labor symptoms occur, and can undergo further screening tests."
76,What Is Brittle Bone Disease?,"Brittle bone disease is a lifelong genetic disorder that causes your bones to break very easily, usually without any type of injury, as from a fall. Your doctor may also call it osteogenesis imperfecta. It affects both sexes and all races equally. There is no cure for brittle bone disease, but your doctor can treat it. Causes Brittle bone disease is passed down through families, or inherited. It’s caused by a defect in a gene that is supposed to make a substance called collagen . Collagen is a protein in your body that forms and strengthens bones. If you don’t have enough of it, your bones become very weak and will break easily. Most children with brittle bone disease get this gene from only one parent, but it’s possible to get it from both. Sometimes a child doesn’t inherit the gene from either parent, but the gene mutation develops on its own. Symptoms The main symptom of brittle bone disease is broken bones. They break very easily. Your child may have a bone break during a diaper change, or even when being burped. Someone with the condition may have only a few broken bones in a lifetime, or may have hundreds of them. Sometimes, babies are born with fractures or get them while growing in their mother’s womb. Other times, symptoms don’t appear until the teen years or later. General symptoms of brittle bone disease may be mild or very severe. They include: Broken bones (fractures) Bleeding and easy bruising (frequent nosebleeds or heavy bleeding after an injury) Blue color in the white part of the eyes Bowing of the legs Breathing problems Brittle, discolored teeth Curved spine , called scoliosis Feeling very tired Skin that is easily hurt Hearing loss that starts in early adulthood Can’t stand warm temperatures Loose joints Short height Weak muscles and tissues Doctors group brittle bone disease into types, based on symptoms and number of fractures.The most common types of brittle bone disease are: Mild Few signs of the condition Little to no bone deformity Number of broken bones from a few to many Height not usually affected May have premature hearing loss Broken bones decrease after puberty Average life expectancy Moderate to severe Increased number and frequency of broken bones Babies can be born with many broken bones, an unstable neck, or soft skull Problems with long bones slowly get worse Short height Abnormally shaped spine and rib cage May have a dozen to several hundred broken bones in a lifetime May not be able to move and may need a motorized wheelchair Severe breathing problems can lead to early death Lethal Babies usually die in the womb or soon after birth Severe fractures and breathing problems cause death soon after birth Diagnosis If your baby is born with broken bones, the doctor can diagnose the condition with a physical exam . Your doctor will examine your child and ask questions about your family and medical history. Blood and urine tests will rule out other health conditions that can cause weak bones, such as rickets . Genetic testing can confirm brittle bone disease. Genetic tests can also tell if you or your family members carry the gene. Treatment There is no cure for brittle bone disease, but treatment can relieve symptoms, prevent breakage of bones, and maximize movement. Severe forms of the disease can affect the shape of the rib cage and spine, which can lead to life-threatening breathing problems. Some people may need to be on oxygen. But in many other cases, people with this condition live a healthy, productive life with monitoring on a regular basis and the right treatment. That treatment may include: Splints and casts for broken bones Braces for weak legs, ankles , knees, and wrists Physical therapy to strengthen the body and improve movement Medicine to make the bones stronger Surgery to implant rods in the arms or legs Special dental work, such as crowns, for brittle teeth Other things that could be helpful: Try to maintain a healthy weight . Too much weight adds stress to the bones. Talk to the doctor or physical therapist about a safe exercise routine. Eat a diet rich in vitamin D and calcium . But high doses of these supplements are not recommended. Avoid alcohol , or drink it only occasionally. Cut back on caffeine . Discuss the use of any steroid medications with your doctor. These drugs reduce bone density. Do not smoke. Avoid secondhand smoke ."
77,Buerger’s Disease (Thromboangiitis Obliterans),"What Is Buerger’s Disease? Buerger’s disease is a rare illness that inflames and blocks blood vessels in your arms and legs. This stops blood flow and leads to clots that affect your hands and feet . Doctors also call it thromboangiitis obliterans , or TAO. There’s no cure for Buerger’s disease. Almost everyone who gets it uses tobacco , including cigarettes, cigars , chewing tobacco, and snuff. Quitting can make the symptoms improve or go away completely. If you don’t quit, you might have severe tissue damage. You could even lose your fingers, toes, or parts of your limbs. Causes of Buerger’s Disease Doctors aren’t sure exactly what causes this condition. Your genes might play a role. Some people may just be more likely to get it. Some experts think that certain chemicals in tobacco might irritate your blood vessels, and that’s what makes them swell. Others think tobacco triggers your immune system to attack your blood vessels like they’re bad germs. Buerger’s Disease Symptoms Usually, the first sign of Buerger’s disease is pain in your hands or feet that spreads to your arms and legs. It may be severe. You can get it when you’re active (called claudication) or resting. It can be worse when you’re cold or stressed. You might also notice changes in your hands and feet. They may: Feel cold , numb, or tingly Look pale, red, or blue in color Have thin, shiny skin Have less hair than usual Your fingers and toes might: Get painful open sores Turn pale when you’re cold (Raynaud’s phenomenon) You could also have swelling along a vein just under your skin. This is usually a sign of a blood clot . See your doctor right away. Buerger’s Disease Complications Over time, Buerger’s disease can slow -- and completely stop -- the blood flow to your fingers and toes. This can cause gangrene , which means the skin and tissue in your toes and fingers start to die. They go numb and turn blue or black. If you have gangrene, your doctor usually has to cut off the affected area. In rare cases, Buerger’s disease can cause a stroke or heart attack . Buerger’s Disease Diagnosis No single test can check for Buerger’s disease. Your doctor will start by asking about your tobacco use and your symptoms. They may do tests to check your blood flow and rule out other diseases that cause similar symptoms. For example, peripheral artery disease also causes pain in your legs, but it’s caused by plaque building up in your arteries , not inflammation . You may also have: The Allen test. This is a basic blood flow test. First, you squeeze your hand into a hard fist, which pushes blood out of your hand. Your doctor then presses on the arteries of your wrist to slow the flow of blood back into your hand. At this point, your hand will lose color. When you open your hand, your doctor releases the pressure over the artery on one side of your wrist and then the other side. If it takes a while for your hand to go back to its usual color, it may be a sign of Buerger’s disease. Angiogram. This is a type of X-ray that checks for blocked blood vessels in your arms and legs. Your doctor places a thin tube, called a catheter, into your artery. They pump dye into the artery and quickly take X-rays to get a look at your blood vessels. A CT or MRI scan can make similar pictures. Blood tests. These help your doctor rule out other diseases. They may want to check for conditions like diabetes , lupus , and those that cause blood clots . Buerger’s Disease Treatment Quitting tobacco is the only way to limit the effects of Buerger’s disease. Even a few cigarettes a day can make it worse. Other treatments may help boost blood flow and ease pain, including: Medications such as vasodilators to widen your blood vessels or others to dissolve clots Walking exercises Intermittent compression of your arms and legs Surgery to cut nerves to an affected area (sympathectomy) Your doctor might need to cut off part or all of an area with infection or gangrene ( amputation ). Researchers are also studying other treatments. Proteins called growth factors might speed healing and ease pain. Injections of stem cells , which can grow into other kinds of cells, may help your body make new blood vessels. Buerger’s Disease Prognosis Your outlook depends on whether you quit tobacco. Of patients who keep using it, about 43% will have an amputation within 8 years of diagnosis. Of those who quit, about 6% have an amputation. That percentage is close to 0 in people who are diagnosed early on. If you’re having a hard time quitting, talk to your doctor about programs that might help."
78,What Are Motor Neuron Diseases?,"When you take a walk, talk to a friend, or chew a piece of food, motor neurons are behind these movements. Just like other parts of your body, they can become damaged. You may have heard of ALS, commonly known as Lou Gehrig’s disease. It’s one kind of motor neuron disease, and there are several other lesser-known types. What Are Motor Neurons? They are a type of nerve cell, and their job is to send messages around your body so you can move. You have two main kinds: Upper motor neurons are in your brain. They send messages from there to your spinal cord. Lower motor neurons are in your spinal cord. They transmit the messages sent from your brain to your muscles. As nerve cells die when you have a motor neuron disease, electrical messages can't get from your brain to your muscles. Over time, your muscles waste away. You may hear a doctor or nurse call this “atrophy.” When this happens, you lose control over movements. It gets harder to walk, talk, swallow, and breathe. Each kind of motor neuron disease affects different types of nerve cells or has a different cause. ALS is the most common of these diseases in adults. Here's a look at some of the types of motor neuron diseases. Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) ALS affects both your upper and lower motor neurons. With ALS, you gradually lose control over the muscles that help you walk, talk, chew, swallow, and breathe. Over time, they weaken and waste away. You may also have stiffness and twitches in your muscles. Most of the time, ALS is what doctors call “sporadic.” This means anyone can get it. Only about 5% to 10% of cases in the United States run in families. ALS usually starts between the ages of 40 and 60.  Most people with the disease live for 3 to 5 years after their symptoms start, yet some people can live for 10 years or longer. Primary Lateral Sclerosis (PLS) PLS is similar to ALS, but it affects only upper motor neurons. It causes weakness and stiffness in the arms and legs, a slowed walk, and poor coordination and balance. Speech also becomes slow and slurred. Like ALS, it usually starts in people 40 to 60 years old. The muscles get stiffer and weaker over time. But unlike ALS, people don't die from it. Progressive Bulbar Palsy (PBP) This is a form of ALS. Many people with this condition will eventually develop ALS. PBP damages motor neurons in the brain stem, which is at the base of your brain. The stem has motor neurons that help you chew, swallow, and speak. With PBP, you might slur your words and have trouble chewing and swallowing. It also makes it hard to control emotions. You may laugh or cry without meaning to. Pseudobulbar Palsy This is similar to progressive bulbar palsy. It affects motor neurons that control the ability to talk, chew, and swallow. Pseudobulbar palsy causes people to laugh or cry with no control. Progressive Muscular Atrophy This form is much less common than ALS or PBP. It can be inherited or sporadic. Progressive muscular atrophy mainly affects your lower motor neurons. Weakness usually starts in your hands and then spreads to other parts of the body. Your muscles get weak and may cramp. This disease can turn into ALS. Spinal Muscular Atrophy This is an inherited condition that affects lower motor neurons. A defect in a gene called SMN1 causes spinal muscular atrophy. This gene makes a protein that protects your motor neurons. Without it, they die. This causes weakness in the upper legs and arms, and in the trunk. SMA comes in different types that are based on when symptoms first appear: Type 1 (also called Werdnig-Hoffmann disease). It starts around age 6 months. Children with this type can't sit on their own or hold up their head. They have weak muscle tone, poor reflexes, and trouble swallowing and breathing. Type 2. It starts between 6 and 12 months. Kids with this form can sit, but they can't stand or walk alone. They may also have trouble breathing. Type 3 (also called Kugelberg-Welander disease). It starts between ages 2 and 17. It affects how a child can walk, run, stand up, and climb stairs. Kids with this type may also have a curved spine or shortened muscles or tendons around their joints. Type 4. It usually starts after age 30 . People with this type may have muscle weakness, shaking, twitching, or breathing problems. It mainly affects muscles in the upper arms and legs. Kennedy's Disease It’s also inherited, and it affects only males. Females can be carriers but don’t get ill from it. A woman with the Kennedy’s disease gene has a 50% chance of passing it on to a son. Males with Kennedy's disease have shaking hands, muscle cramps and twitches, and weakness in their face, arms, and legs. They may have trouble swallowing and speaking. Men can have enlarged breasts and a low sperm count. Living With a Motor Neuron Disease The outlook is different for each type of motor neuron disease. Some are milder and progress more slowly than others. Although there is no cure for motor neuron diseases, medicines and therapy can ease symptoms and improve your quality of life."
79,What Is Epidermolysis Bullosa?,"Epidermolysis bullosa is a rare genetic condition that makes skin so fragile that it can tear or blister at the slightest touch. Children born with it are often called “Butterfly Children” because their skin seems as fragile as a butterfly wing. Mild forms may get better with time. But severe cases can be painful, trigger other serious health issues, and can be life-threatening. If you have this condition, you need special treatment to keep your delicate skin as healthy as possible. Types There are five major types of epidermolysis bullosa. The kind you have depends on where your blisters tend to form. Epidermolysis Bullosa Simplex: The most common type, it first shows up in newborns. It mainly affects the palms of the hands and soles of the feet . Junctional epidermolysis bullosa : While it also first appears in babies, this is a more severe form that causes blistering in deep layers of the skin. Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa: If you have this type, your skin doesn’t have collagen to hold it together, or the collagen you do have doesn’t work well. This means the layers of your skin don’t seal together like they should. Sometimes this type doesn’t show up until early childhood. Kindler syndrome: This is a mixed condition since blisters appear across different skin layers. It can also cause patchy changes in your skin coloring when it’s exposed to the sun. Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita: This form causes blisters on your hands and feet as well as in mucous membranes like the mouth . Causes Almost all types of epidermolysis bullosa run in families. If you inherited certain gene glitches from your parents, you will have it. There’s one exception. Epidermolysis bullosa aquisita is the only type that’s not inherited. It happens because of a problem in your immune system . Symptoms Usually, signs of epidermolysis bullosa first appear in babies or toddlers . Painful skin blisters are the main symptom. They can form anywhere on the skin. Sometimes they also form on the eyes , or in parts of the throat, stomach , or bladder . If these blisters become infected or scar the skin, they cause more problems. Diagnosis To confirm the condition, your doctor may take a small sample of skin and send it to a lab where experts will use a microscope to look at it. Treatment There’s no cure for epidermolysis bullosa. But there are treatments for it. If you have a severe case, you’ll care for your skin much like someone who has a burn does. You’ll need to learn how to perform daily wound treatment and how to bandage and protect affected areas. Your doctor can also prescribe a medicine to help with pain relief. In some cases, you might need surgery. If you have blisters that have fused your fingers and toes together, your doctor can separate them. Or if your esophagus , the tube connecting your mouth to your stomach , becomes too scarred, you can get surgery to widen it to help you eat. Some people with epidermolysis bullosa still find eating too painful. In that case, your doctor may suggest a feeding tube so food goes right into your stomach. Tips for At-Home Care To help prevent blisters, you have to take special care of your skin. Reduce friction. Use lotion to keep your skin moist and reduce friction. If you cover wounds, use only dressings that aren’t sticky, then loosely wrap again with rolled gauze. Wear loose-fitting clothes without tags, tight sleeves, or seams. Drain blisters. If left untreated, these can fill with fluid and become infected. Your doctor can show you the best way to drain them. Keep cool. Keep your bath water no warmer than room temperature. Stay in air conditioning as much as you can and avoid heat and humidity. Know the signs of infection. Your skin may get red or feel hot to the touch if it is becoming infected. You could also notice pus or a yellow discharge crusting at the site, a red streak under the skin, or have fever or chills. If you see any of these signs, call your doctor right away. You may need antibiotics . Check your diet . Many people with epidermolysis bullosa have low levels of iron, selenium , or vitamin D . Your doctor may suggest that you see a nutritionist about eating more foods that are rich in these vitamins and minerals. Get support. Talk to your doctor or someone you trust. You might also find it helpful to talk about your feelings to a therapist or at a support group in your area."
80,What Does Bullying Look Like?,"Mia Dand knew something was up when her daughter Rhea’s behavior took a sharp turn for the worse. Her 10-year-old started to burst into tears at the drop of a hat, act out at home, and make excuses to skip school, she recalls. At the time, Dand blamed her recent divorce for the outbursts. “This went on for months, so I finally sat her down and asked what was going on,” she says. Dand was blindsided by the answer. Rhea, now 12, was the target of “mean girls” at her small private school in the San Francisco area. “This group of girls completely alienated her and started a whispering campaign. They would mutter ‘secrets’ to each other when she was around to make her feel like an outcast.” Rhea was miserable. When Teasing Crosses the Line What happened to Rhea goes beyond “normal” childhood teasing. “Teasing typically happens among friends or kids trying to fit in with their peers,” says Patricia Agatston, PhD, president of the International Bullying Prevention Association. When it goes back and forth equally between kids, it’s usually playful. If one person asks for it to stop, the other does so, she says. For adolescent boys, teasing is a “rite of passage” and an important part of friendship, says David Dupper, PhD, professor of social work at the University of Tennessee. Teasing can get rough, but it’s not meant to hurt the other person, he says. “On the other hand, a bully fully intends to harm his or her victim and has the power and the means to do so.” This person might be more popular or physically stronger, and the victim may have a hard time defending themselves, Dupper says. Kids who are seen as different or don’t “fit in” are typical targets, he says. This includes children who have a disability, are overweight, or are thought to be homosexual. Bullying tactics include: Hitting, punching, or pushing Name calling or rumor spreading Taunting on social media, the Internet, and cell phones, also called “cyberbullying” Leaving a child “out” on purpose Watch for Red Flags Dand was shocked her daughter didn’t share what was going on right away. “I thought she would feel comfortable coming to me or her dad.” But it’s pretty common for kids to suffer in silence. It’s estimated only about a quarter tell a parent or other adult, Dupper says. Kids keep it secret for many reasons. They may think telling their parent will make things worse, Agatston says. Or, like Rhea, some think they need to handle it on their own. Since most kids won’t fess up, watch for these warning signs: Unexplained cuts or bruises Few friends Your child doesn’t want to go to school or ride the bus Headaches or stomachaches Asks for or steals money. (They might be trying to “pay off” the bully.) Moodiness A noticeable drop in grades If you think your child may be getting bullied, use meal times to bring up the subject in a roundabout way, Agatston suggests. Ask if they’ve ever seen a friend be bullied. If they say yes, ask what they think might help, she adds. It may be tempting to tell your child to fight back, but don’t. Instead, encourage them to clearly and confidently tell the bully to stop, or simply walk away and tell an adult. The Toll of Bullying When it happens regularly it can cause lasting problems like depression and low self-esteem. It also raises the risk of suicide in kids with other problems like mental health or substance abuse issues, Dupper says. John Halligan of Farmingdale, N.Y., knows this all too well. His 13-year-old son Ryan took his own life in 2003 after years of torment. Halligan and his wife knew Ryan was having trouble back when he was in the fifth grade. In the seventh, Ryan started spending a lot of time on the computer in his room. After the suicide, Halligan logged on to his son's instant messaging account and found out he'd been the target of cyberbullying for months. Thirteen years later, Halligan is using the tragedy to teach kids about bullying, depression, and suicide. He’s visited more than 1,600 schools to tell his son’s story and stress the importance of speaking up and getting help from adults. Halligan shares his lessons learned with parents, too. Looking back, he says his biggest mistake was underestimating the power of emotional bullying. It’s a mistake that a lot of fathers of boys make, he says. “We want our sons to toughen up and stand up to these people. That might have worked a generation ago, but the Internet has unleashed the capability to demolish somebody emotionally. That’s what happened to my son.” If your child is constantly bullied online or in person, here’s what you can do: Gather evidence. “Start a journal and write down the details of each episode,” Halligan says. Jot down what happened and who did it. Include the date, time, place, and the names of bystanders. If it happened online, quickly take a screen shot before the evidence is deleted, he says. Go to the school. Review your state’s anti-bullying law and set up a meeting. Bring your evidence so you can make a strong case. “Have a very business-like discussion and try to keep your emotions in check,” Halligan says. Ask the school to work on a plan to help your child feel safe. Agatston says you may want to suggest: A change in schedule Choosing an adult your child can confide in More supervision during “problem times” Don’t confront the bully. As much as you may want to do that, it's a bad idea that often backfires, Halligan says. It makes you look like the bully and can set up a situation where families are feuding back and forth, he adds. Consider switching schools. Some have bad administrators and bullying flourishes, Halligan says. If you change schools, tell the new teachers and even the principal about past problems, Dupper says. Ask what the new school will do to keep those troubles from happening again. That’s how Dand made things better for her daughter. Rhea now goes to a big public school. “There is more diversity and a larger group of kids, so she was able to find her 'tribe,'” she says. Keep talking. “No matter how well you think you know your child and no matter how close you are, they will not tell you everything,” Dand says. So she checks in with Rhea regularly. “I make her shut down all her devices, and take her for a long drive or walk until she talks to me about everything good, bad, or otherwise in her world.” Halligan says less technology and more talking could have changed things for Ryan. Every moment his son spent alone on the computer trying to deal with the bullies “was a missed opportunity to have a conversation with Mom or Dad about what was going on in his life,” he says.

81,Bunions,"What Are Bunions? A bunion is a bony, often painful bump at the base of the big toe. It can happen if your big toe leans slightly toward your other toes. Over time, the base of the big toe pushes outward against the first metatarsal bone, which is directly behind it. Bunions form at a joint. That’s where the toe bends normally when you walk. But when you have a bunion, all of your body weight rests on it each time you take a step. It can hurt when you walk. And, because your shoe likely rubs against it, a bunion can also cause calluses to form. Bunion Symptoms Take a look at your foot. See where the bottom of your big toe connects to your foot? If you see a bony bump there with your big toe headed in the opposite direction, you probably have a bunion. Other symptoms of a bunion include: Swelling Redness Tenderness when you touch it Pain that is constant or may come and go Limited movement of the joint or toe Corns or calluses A bunion may also become shiny and feel warm when you touch it. Bunion Causes and Risk Factors Foot problems typically start in early adulthood. As we age, our feet spread, and the problems tend to get worse. Factors that may contribute to bunions include: Genetics. Bunions can run in the family. Foot structure. Weak or poor foot structure can lead to bunions. Leg length. If one of your legs is longer than the other, you may develop a bunion on the big toe of the longer one. Arthritis . Certain types of arthritis make bunions more likely. This is especially true of inflammatory types of arthritis such as rheumatoid arthritis. Shoes. Wearing high heels or tight shoes may make bunions more likely. This is why they happen in women more than men. Bunion Diagnosis If you have pain when you’re walking in flat shoes that should feel comfortable, make an appointment with a podiatrist (a foot specialist). It could be a bunion or some other problem. Your doctor will look at your foot. They may want to take an X-ray to decide how best to treat your bunion. Bunion Treatment Your doctor may suggest ways to help with the pressure and pain. These include: Wearing shoes that give your feet space. Adding pads or cushions to act as a buffer between the bump and your shoes. Taking over-the-counter pain medicine or anti-inflammatory medicines. Adding foot support to your shoes. Icing your bunion, especially when it’s bothering you or you’ve been on your feet too long. If those measures don’t help enough, you might need surgery. Surgery for a bunion might: Remove inflamed tissue from around your toe joint. Straighten your toe by removing some bone. Realign one or more bones to correct the abnormal angle. Join bones in parts of your foot. Foot surgery may take time to recover from fully. If you are considering surgery, talk to your doctor about what you can expect."
82,Yellow Fever,"Yellow fever is a viral infection transmitted by a bite from infected mosquitoes most commonly found in parts of South America and Africa. When transmitted to humans, the yellow fever virus can damage the liver and other internal organs and be potentially fatal. The World Health Organization estimates there are 200,000 cases of yellow fever worldwide each year, resulting in 30,000 deaths. Yellow fever appears to be on the rise internationally, due to a decreased immunity to infection among local populations, deforestation, climate change, and high-density urbanization. How High Is the Risk of Yellow Fever? The CDC has identified 42 countries with a risk of yellow fever transmission, many of them with tropical climates. While the actual number of yellow fever cases among U.S. and European travelers to these at-risk countries is low, vaccination is advised for most international travelers to these countries, because yellow fever has no cure and can be deadly. How Does Yellow Fever Spread? Yellow fever is typically spread to humans from bites by infected mosquitoes. People cannot spread yellow fever among themselves through casual contact, although the infection could possibly be transmitted directly into the blood through contaminated needles. A few different species of mosquitoes transmit the yellow fever virus; some breed in urban areas, others in jungles. Mosquitoes that breed in the jungle also transmit yellow fever to monkeys, who, in addition to humans, are a host for the disease. Yellow Fever Symptoms Yellow fever gets its name from two of its most obvious symptoms: fever and yellowing of the skin . The yellowing occurs because the disease causes liver damage and hepatitis . For some people, yellow fever has no initial symptoms, while for others, the first symptoms appear from three to six days after exposure to the virus from a mosquito bite . An infection with yellow fever typically has three phases. The first phase of symptoms can last for three to four days and then, for most people, disappears. The first phase is generally non-specific and cannot be distinguished from other viral infections. The initial symptoms of yellow fever are: Fever and chills Flu -like symptoms such as muscle aches, headache , and vomiting The next phase is remission , which lasts for 48 hours. Patients improve. The majority recover. Unfortunately, a third, more toxic phase of infection occurs for 15% to 25% of patients. Ultimately, a condition called viral hemorrhagic fever can develop, with internal bleeding (hemorrhaging), high fever , and damage to the liver, kidneys , and circulatory system. The World Health Organization estimates that up to 50% of people worldwide who reach this severe phase of infection die, while half recover. The third-phase symptoms of yellow fever can include: Jaundice (liver damage), which causes yellowing of the skin and eyes Hepatitis (inflammation of the liver) Internal bleeding (hemorrhaging) Vomiting blood Shock Multisystem organ failure leading to death How Is Yellow Fever Diagnosed? Yellow fever is diagnosed by your symptoms, recent travel activity, and blood tests. Yellow fever symptoms can mimic symptoms of other tropical diseases such as malaria and typhoid , so call your doctor if you have symptoms of yellow fever and have recently traveled to a high-risk country. How Is Yellow Fever Treated? Because there is no cure for the viral infection itself, medical treatment of yellow fever focuses on easing symptoms such as fever, muscle pain , and dehydration . Because of the risk of internal bleeding, avoid aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs if you suspect you have yellow fever. Hospitalization is often needed. Yellow Fever Prevention Through Vaccination Because there is no cure for yellow fever, prevention is critical. The yellow fever vaccine is advised for adults and children over age 9 months who are traveling to or living in countries with a known risk of yellow fever. Certain countries in Africa and Latin America with the highest risk of exposure to yellow fever now require proof of yellow fever vaccination before allowing you to travel there. Travel medicine clinics and state or local health departments usually offer the vaccine , which needs to be repeated every 10 years for people traveling to high-risk areas. These approved vaccination centers can also provide you with the International Certificate of Vaccination that you'll need to enter certain at-risk countries. Call your doctor right away if you develop a fever, flu -like symptoms, or other unusual signs after taking the vaccine. The yellow fever vaccine , in a few rare cases, has caused an allergic reaction , nervous system reaction, and life-threatening illness. Who Should Not Be Vaccinated for Yellow Fever? Yellow fever vaccination is not advised for everyone. The vaccine can cause serious adverse effects in certain people. Efforts are underway to develop a vaccine that will be safer. Talk with your doctor before getting the vaccine if you: Have a compromised immune system, such as from HIV Have cancer or thymus gland problems Have had treatment that can disrupt the immune system, such as steroids or cancer treatment Have had a life-threatening allergic reaction to eggs, chicken, gelatin, or past yellow fever vaccine Are pregnant or breastfeeding Are age 65 or older Your child is younger than 9 months old. Keep in mind that vaccination has two goals: to protect the health of individual travelers coming into high-risk regions and to protect the public health of countries by preventing the import of yellow fever into their region. If you're exempt from vaccination for medical reasons, you may need to provide proof of exemption for entry into some countries. Other Yellow Fever Prevention Measures Vaccination is the most important measure you should take when traveling to areas where exposure to the yellow fever virus is possible. No other measure is more effective, but there are other valuable recommendations. You should: Use the right insect repellent for mosquitoes on exposed skin and follow package directions. Buy one with DEET, picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus, or an ingredient called IR3535. Cover your arms, hands, legs, and head to protect yourself from bites. Use a mosquito repellent containing permethrin on the outside of clothing, mosquito netting, and other gear. Use screens on windows and doors, and mosquito netting over beds, to keep mosquitoes away. Avoid the outdoors during peak mosquito hours (dusk to dawn for many types of mosquitoes that carry the infection). Keep accurate records of international travel dates, locations, and outdoor activities in case you need to identify a viral infection when you return."
83,Burning Mouth Syndrome,"What Is Burning Mouth Syndrome? Burning mouth syndrome is the name for burning pain in your mouth that doesn’t have a known cause. Most often, the pain is on the tip of your tongue or roof of your mouth . But sometimes it's in the front of your mouth or on the inner part of your lips. It often lasts for many years. About a third of people who have burning mouth syndrome say it started after some kind of dental work, an illness, or a course of medication. But most can't link it to any unusual event. Symptoms of Burning Mouth Syndrome If you have burning mouth syndrome, your mouth can feel like you just drank hot coffee or had some hot soup. It feels different for each person. In general, burning mouth syndrome symptoms can include: Burning feeling on the tongue, roof of the mouth, gums, inside of the cheeks, and in the back of the throat, which may be relieved with eating or drinking Numbness or tingling of the tongue, which can come and go Trouble swallowing Dry mouth Sore throat Changes in taste, such as a bad taste of metal in your mouth The pain may get worse throughout the day. If the burning doesn't go away or gets worse, see your dentist or doctor. Causes of Burning Mouth Syndrome Burning mouth syndrome is grouped as primary or secondary, depending on the cause. Primary burning mouth syndrome The burning pain can’t be explained by a lab test or other health condition. You might also hear primary burning mouth syndrome called idiopathic burning mouth syndrome. Doctors think the cause could be damage to nerves that control taste or pain. Secondary burning mouth syndrome Sometimes, burning mouth syndrome results from another health event or condition. In this case, it’s called secondary burning mouth syndrome. Causes of secondary burning mouth syndrome include: Acid reflux (acid from your stomach comes back up into your mouth) Allergic reaction to materials used in dentures Anxiety or depression Changes in hormones due to the thyroid disease, diabetes, or menopause Dry mouth resulting from diseases or treatments; for example, Sjogren’s syndrome and radiation therapy Medications used to treat blood pressure Dentures don’t fit well Lack of iron, vitamin B12, or folic acid Reaction to certain toothpastes or mouthwashes Stress Thrush (a yeast infection in your mouth) Risk Factors for Burning Mouth Syndrome Burning mouth syndrome is more common in women than men. You might be more likely to get it if you’re: A woman between ages 50-70 Going through menopause Burning Mouth Syndrome Diagnosis Your doctor will want to know about your symptoms and when they began. They'll also ask if you have allergies , take any medications , or smoke or drink often. The doctor will examine your mouth and check for infection. You may need several tests to rule out other medical issues. These include: Allergy test to see if you have a reaction to a product or medication Biopsy (the doctor removes a small piece of tissue from your mouth and sends it out for tests) Blood tests to see if you have thyroid problems or diabetes CT scan (several X-rays are taken from different angles then put together to show a more complete picture) MRI (powerful magnets and radio waves combine to make detailed images) Salivary flow tests to measure your saliva Burning Mouth Syndrome Treatment If the doctor finds a health problem or other cause for your burning mouth, you have secondary burning mouth syndrome. They’ll treat the issue, and your symptoms should get better. If not, there's no known cure for burning mouth syndrome, but there are ways to ease and control your symptoms. Depending on the cause of your burning mouth syndrome, the doctor may suggest one or more of these treatments: Medicines that help with nerve-related pain such as amitriptyline ( Elavil ) and nortriptyline ( Aventyl, Pamelor ) Capsaicin , a pain reliever made from hot peppers Clonazepam (Klonopin), taken in low doses Female hormone replacement Mouth rinses Products that replace your saliva Vitamin supplements You can do a few things that may help your symptoms as well: Avoid acidic foods like tomatoes and orange and citrus juices. Avoid alcohol , including mouthwashes with alcohol. Avoid cinnamon and mint. Avoid spicy foods. Avoid tobacco . Chew sugar -free gum (so you'll make more saliva). Drink a lot of fluids. Reduce stress with yoga or hobbies. Stay socially active or join a pain support group. Suck on crushed ice. Complications of Burning Mouth Syndrome Burning mouth syndrome is a chronic pain condition and can affect your quality of life. It may take many doctor visits to diagnose the condition. The pain may last for months, even years. Some people have pain every day. The pain may make you feel depressed, stressed, or anxious, making it hard to do everyday activities and sleep. Any type of chronic pain can lead to anxiety which is known to cause sleeping problems."
84,Thermal Burns Treatment,"Call 911 if: The burn penetrates all layers of the skin. The skin is leathery or charred looking, with white, brown, or black patches. The person is an infant or a senior. For All Burns 1. Stop Burning Immediately Put out fire or stop the person's contact with hot liquid, steam, or other material. Help the person ""stop, drop, and roll"" to smother flames. Remove smoldering material from the person. Remove hot or burned clothing. If clothing sticks to skin, cut or tear around it. 2. Remove Constrictive Clothing Immediately Take off jewelry, belts, and tight clothing. Burns can swell quickly. Then take the following steps: For First-Degree Burns (Affecting Top Layer of Skin) 1. Cool Burn Hold burned skin under cool (not cold) running water or immerse in cool water until the pain subsides. Use compresses if running water isn't available. 2. Protect Burn Cover with sterile, non-adhesive bandage or clean cloth. Do not apply butter, oil, lotions, or creams (especially if they contain fragrance). Apply a petroleum-based ointment two to three times per day. 3. Treat Pain Give over-the-counter pain reliever such as acetaminophen (Panadol, Tylenol), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, Nuprin), or naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn). 4. When to See a Doctor Seek medical help if: You see signs of infection, like increased pain, redness, swelling, fever, or oozing. The person needs tetanus or booster shot, depending on date of last injection. Tetanus booster should be given every 10 years. The burn blister is larger than two inches or oozes. Redness and pain last more than a few hours. The pain gets worse. The hands, feet, face, or genitals are burned. 5. Follow Up The doctor will examine the burn and may prescribe antibiotics and pain medication. For Second-Degree Burns (Affecting Top 2 Layers of Skin) 1. Cool Burn Immerse in cool water for 10 or 15 minutes. Use compresses if running water isn't available. Don't apply ice. It can lower body temperature and cause further pain and damage. Don't break blisters or apply butter or ointments, which can cause infection. 2. Protect Burn Cover loosely with sterile, nonstick bandage and secure in place with gauze or tape. 3. Prevent Shock Unless the person has a head, neck, or leg injury, or it would cause discomfort: Lay the person flat. Elevate feet about 12 inches. Elevate burn area above heart level, if possible. Cover the person with a coat or blanket. 4. See a Doctor The doctor can test burn severity, prescribe antibiotics and pain medications, and administer a tetanus shot , if needed. For Third-Degree Burns 1. Call 911 2. Protect Burn Area Cover loosely with sterile, nonstick bandage or, for large areas, a sheet or other material that that won't leave lint in wound. Separate burned toes and fingers with dry, sterile dressings. Do not soak the burn in water or apply ointments or butter, which can cause infection. 3. Prevent Shock Unless the person has a head, neck, or leg injury or it would cause discomfort: Lay the person flat. Elevate feet about 12 inches. Elevate burn area above heart level, if possible. Cover the person with a coat or blanket. For an airway burn, do not place a pillow under the person's head when the person is lying down. This can close the airway. Have a person with a facial burn sit up. Check pulse and breathing to monitor for shock until emergency help arrives. 4. See a Doctor Doctors will give oxygen and fluid, if needed, and treat the burn."
85,"Bursitis: Symptoms, Causes, and Treatment","What Is Bursitis? Bursitis is inflammation or irritation of a bursa sac. You have these sacs all over your body. They’re filled with fluid that eases rubbing and friction between tissues such as bones, muscles, tendons, and skin. Bursitis is common around major joints such as your shoulder, elbow, hip, or knee. Bursitis in your knee may be caused by pressure on your joints over time. (Photo credit: E+ / Getty Images) What Are Bursitis Causes and Risk Factors? Bursitis is common in adults, especially after age 40. It’s usually caused by repeated pressure on an area or by using a joint too much. High-risk activities include gardening, raking, carpentry, shoveling, painting, scrubbing, playing tennis, golf, skiing, and throwing. You can also get bursitis by sitting or standing the wrong way for a long time at work or home, or by not stretching enough before you exercise. Sudden injury can sometimes cause bursitis. As you age, your tendons aren’t able to handle stress as well. They’re less elastic and easier to tear. If there’s a problem with the structure of a bone or joint (such as legs that are different lengths or arthritis in a joint), it can put more stress on a bursa, causing bursitis. Reactions to medications and stress or inflammation from other conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis , gout , psoriatic arthritis , or thyroid disorders , may also raise your risk. An infection, especially with Staphylococcus aureus bacteria, can sometimes cause bursitis. What Are the Types of Bursitis? Bursas are small sacs filled with fluid that help cushion your joints, bones, and muscles. Any bursa can become inflamed, but the most common places to have bursitis are in your shoulder, elbow, knee, hip, or foot. Bursitis can happen suddenly, or it can be ongoing (chronic). When it comes on suddenly, it usually hurts to move your affected joint. With chronic bursitis, a bursa swells slowly, and you may or may not feel pain. Sometimes, bursitis is caused by an infection. This is called septic bursitis, and it’s not as common. Your doctor will check to make sure you don’t have an infection. Shoulder bursitis Shoulder bursitis causes painful swelling in your shoulder that gets worse when you move it. This can be caused by an injury or bump. Some people’s shoulder bones are naturally shaped in a way that puts more pressure on the bursa. If your bones are shaped like this, you're more likely to get shoulder bursitis. Depending on how bad the swelling is, you might not be able to move your shoulder, a condition called frozen shoulder. If it hurts too much to move your shoulder, you should see your doctor. They can do tests to find out if it’s bursitis or a different problem. They might recommend physical therapy for your shoulder or other treatments. Elbow bursitis One of the most common places to get bursitis is the pointy part of your elbow. If you have elbow bursitis, the bottom of your elbow will be swollen, red, and painful, with pain that gets worse when you bend it. Because of the swelling, it can look like there’s a small ball under your skin. If the ball gets bigger, it can make it harder to move your elbow. Leaning on your elbows a lot can lead to elbow bursitis. Plumbers, electricians, HVAC technicians, and other people who have to crawl into tight spaces for work are more likely to put pressure on their elbows as they do their jobs. This kind of bursitis is also called “students’ elbow” because many people lean on their elbows when they sit at a desk to write or use a computer. Injuries or bumps can also cause elbow bursitis. You might not remember the injury because it can take at least a week for bursitis to start. Doctors don’t understand why, but people who get dialysis for kidney problems are more likely to get elbow bursitis. You can wrap an elastic bandage around your elbow or wear elbow pads to help ease your pain. If you do work that puts pressure on your elbows, wearing elbow pads or using a padded mat can help you avoid bursitis. Knee bursitis There are many different parts of your knee that can get bursitis, including near your kneecap or on the inside of your knee. If your bursitis is in your kneecap, it’s more likely to be caused by an infection. When you have bursitis, it often hurts to move or put pressure on your knee, and it can hurt if someone else touches it. Your knee might also feel warmer than the rest of your body, and it sometimes looks swollen or red. Sometimes, knee bursitis comes on suddenly after an injury or bump to your knee. More often, it's caused by pressure on your knee joints over time, and the pain comes on slowly. Runners and people who kneel on the ground for work, such as landscapers, gardeners, and plumbers, are more likely to get knee bursitis. If you do these kinds of work, you should wear knee pads or use a padded cushion or board under your knees, and take as many breaks as you can. Try not to squat or bend your knees for too long. Stretching your hamstrings and other muscles before you exercise can help prevent knee bursitis. People who fall a lot, such as wrestlers and people who play sports like football, are also more likely to get knee bursitis because they are more likely to bump or land on their knees. Your doctor will look at both your knees, even if only one knee hurts, to compare them to each other and figure out what’s wrong. They might tell you to wear a knee brace or wrap to help you heal and protect your knees in the future. Putting your knee up on a pillow can help the swelling go down. Hip bursitis You can get bursitis in the bony part of your hip that sticks out near your waist. If you have this kind of bursitis, you might feel pain in your hip or outer thigh. You can also get bursitis on the inside of your hip, which causes pain in your hip, crotch, or groin. You might not see any swelling if you have bursitis in your hip, but it can be painful. At first, the pain often feels sharp, and then turns into an ache that spreads out across your hip. It might hurt more when you lay on your hip, walk up the stairs, squat, or stand up from sitting down. You are more likely to get this kind of bursitis if you have problems with your back or hips, if you’ve had hip replacement surgery, or if you were born with one leg that’s a little shorter than the other. Exercises such as running, riding a bike, or climbing up stairs can irritate it. You have a bigger risk of getting hip bursitis if you have a job where you have to move heavy things or stand up for long periods (for example if you’re a cashier, warehouse worker, or server). If you have hip bursitis, your doctor might tell you to walk with a cane or use crutches while it heals. They might watch you walk, sit, and stand, or even videotape you. This will help them teach you less painful ways of moving around or standing. Foot bursitis There are 33 joints in your feet, and many of these joints have bursa sacs to protect them. You can get bursitis in your feet if any of these bursa sacs get irritated. You might have bursitis around your Achilles tendon in the back of your foot, near your heel, in the ball of your foot, at the base of your toes, or in between the outside of your little toe and your ankle. If you have foot bursitis, your foot might feel swollen, stiff, or painful. The pain might get worse when you walk, run, or stand on your tip-toes. High heels and shoes that squish your feet or don’t fit you well can lead to bursitis. Athletes, dancers, and runners are more likely to get foot bursitis. Wearing supportive shoes that fit you well and stretching your feet and legs before you exercise can help prevent bursitis. If you have foot bursitis, your doctor might tell you to go to a podiatrist. A podiatrist is a doctor who takes care of feet and ankles. They might give you a piece of foam or plastic called an orthotic to put in your shoe to cushion your foot. Other types of bursitis You have about 150 bursas throughout your body. It’s not as common, but you can get bursitis in any of these bursas. Some other types of bursitis are: Buttocks bursitis This is when a bursa near the main muscle of your buttocks becomes inflamed. This type of bursitis is sometimes called “weaver’s bottom” or “tailor’s bottom” because it's more common in people who often sit on hard surfaces, such as the floor or chairs that are not padded. This kind of bursitis can cause pain and aching in your buttocks and upper thighs. The pain is usually worse after you sit for a long time, stretch, or exercise. It might also hurt when you flex, extend, or move your hips. You can use a donut-shaped pillow to make sitting more comfortable. A cold compress on the area can help you feel better. What Are the Symptoms of Bursitis? Pain is the most common symptom of bursitis. It might build up slowly or be sudden and severe, especially if you have calcium deposits in the area. You’ll probably feel it when you stretch or extend the joint, and you may have a limited range of motion even without pain. Your joint might also be: Stiff Swollen Red Call your doctor if you have: Fever (over 102 F or 38.89 C) Swelling, redness, and warmth in the area General illness or more than one area that hurts Trouble moving the joint Pain that lasts longer than 2 weeks These could be signs of an infection or another problem that needs medical care right away. How Do You Prevent Bursitis? You can’t always prevent bursitis, but some steps can lower your risk. Use cushions or pads when you’re resting a joint on a hard surface (for example, if you’re kneeling or sitting). If you play sports, mix things up so you don’t make the same motions all the time. Warm up and stretch before you play, and always use proper form. Start slowly and easily when you’re trying a new exercise or sport. As you build strength, you can use more force and do the motion more often. Don’t sit still for a long time. Take breaks often when you’re making the same motions over and over again. Maintain good posture all day. Hip bursitis can come from having one leg longer than the other. An orthotic shoe insert can help. Keep a healthy body weight. If something hurts, stop doing it and check with your doctor. How Is Bursitis Diagnosed? Your doctor will ask about your symptoms and do a physical exam to see if the joint is swollen. You might also have tests including: Imaging tests . X-rays can rule out other problems that might be causing pain. MRI and ultrasound give your doctor an image of your joint. Lab tests . Your doctor might use a needle to take a bit of fluid from your bursa and test it for signs of infection. Bursitis Treatment Bursitis usually gets better on its own after a few weeks of resting the affected area. Try not to put pressure on it, and avoid activities that make the pain worse. You can take medicine such as ibuprofen or naproxen sodium to lower the swelling and help with pain. Your doctor might give you this medicine in cream or lotion form. See your doctor if you don’t feel better after resting the affected area. Call your doctor right away if you can’t move the joint at all or the area around it is very swollen or red. If you have a fever or there’s a rash or bruise on the area, you should see a doctor—these are signs that your bursitis might be caused by an infection. Your doctor will do an exam to make sure it’s bursitis and not something else. They might have you bend or move the affected joint, or ask you to move around or walk. This helps them figure out which bursa is inflamed, and suggest exercises to help you heal. They might also do blood tests or imaging, such as an ultrasound or MRI, to get more information. If your doctor thinks an infection could be causing your bursitis, they might take some fluid out using a small needle, and then test the fluid for bacteria. Your doctor will give you antibiotics to take at home if you have an infection. It’s rare, but you might need to stay in the hospital and get antibiotics through an IV, especially if you have immune system problems or if the infection is very bad. Your doctor might give you steroids, a medicine that works quickly to lower inflammation and pain. They might prescribe steroid pills to take at home or use a small needle to inject steroids or pain medicine into the irritated area. Doctors disagree about whether steroid shots are helpful. Depending on where your bursitis is, your doctor might tell you to use a cane, crutches or a brace, elastic bandage, or split. Physical therapy can help you strengthen muscles and increase your joint's range of motion. Your physical therapist might also teach you exercises for your core (the muscles in your back and belly that hold you up). A doctor or physical therapist can show you ways of sitting, standing, and moving that help bursitis get better or stop it from happening again. It’s rare, but you might need surgery if other treatments aren’t helping. Bursitis Home Remedies Here are some things you can do to help your bursitis get better: Rest. Rest the area as much as you can, and avoid doing anything that makes the pain worse. Ice. Put an ice pack or cold compress on the area to help the swelling go down. After the first 2 days of icing it, you can also use a heating pad, hot water bottle, or heat pack, or take a hot bath or shower. Support the joint. Use a brace, ace bandage/elastic band, or splint to cushion the joint. Elevate it. Put the affected joint up on pillows. Cushioning. Pad the affected area and avoid hard surfaces. For example, use knee pads or a padded mat if you need to kneel down for work, or sit on a donut-shaped pillow or padded cushion instead of on the floor. Stretching and exercise. Stretch before exercising. Doing exercises that strengthen your core muscles and make you more flexible can help some kinds of bursitis. Posture. Use good posture and body mechanics. A doctor or physical therapist can help you learn ways to move, sit, and lift that are easy on your body and won’t irritate your joints. Massage. Massaging the area can help, but you should check with your doctor to make sure your bursitis isn’t caused by an infection before you massage it. Avoid repetitive movements, pressure, and heavy lifting. If possible, avoid putting pressure on the area, don’t lift heavy things, and try not to do the same motions over and over. If you can’t avoid this, take as many breaks as you can. Ask your doctor for a note if you need to miss work or make changes to the kind of work you do—for example, sitting on a padded chair instead of standing. Takeaways Bursitis is a painful swelling in one of the sacs of fluid that cushion your joints. It is caused by making the same motion over and over, leaning or putting pressure on your joints, or an injury or infection. The condition usually goes away on its own, but you should see your doctor if you have a fever, a lot of swelling or redness, a rash or bruising on the area, or if it hurts too much to move your joint. Bursitis FAQs What triggers bursitis? Bursitis can be triggered by an injury or bump to one of your bursas. Sometimes, you don’t remember the injury because it didn’t hurt at the time. Bursitis can also be caused by leaning on a joint for long periods and by making the same motions over and over. This often happens at work, for example, if you kneel on the ground to garden or fix cars, or make the same movements working on an assembly line or at a desk. Exercises such as running or biking can put pressure on your joints and lead to bursitis. It’s rare, but some kinds of surgeries can trigger bursitis. Older adults and people who have arthritis, diabetes, gout, or other health problems are more likely to get bursitis. If you are older or you have problems with your immune system, you have a higher risk of getting the kind of bursitis that’s caused by an infection. Sometimes, doctors don’t know what causes bursitis. Does bursitis go away on its own? Bursitis often goes away by itself. Resting the area and using home remedies can help it get better. If your bursitis pain doesn’t get better after resting it and avoiding activities that make the pain worse, you should see your doctor. If your bursitis is caused by an infection, it’s less likely to go away on its own, because you need antibiotics to treat it. You should see your doctor right away if you have a fever, or if the affected area is very warm, red, or has a rash or bruises on it."
