0,"Trisomy 13 (Patau Syndrome): Symptoms, Causes, and Diagnosis","[""What Is Trisomy 13 (Patau Syndrome)? Trisomy 13, sometimes called Patau syndrome, is a rare genetic condition that happens when babies have an extra 13th chromosome. Chromosomes in our cells carry DNA, which controls how our bodies develop. Usually, people have 23 pairs of chromosomes, half from each parent. But babies with trisomy 13 have three copies of chromosome 13 instead of two. This causes very serious physical and mental issues. If you're carrying a fetus with trisomy 13, a miscarriage is likely. Most babies born with it don’t live past their first year, though some can survive much longer. This condition affects 1 in every 10,000 to 20,000 newborns."", ""Trisomy 13 Causes Trisomy 13 syndrome happens when cells don't divide normally while a fetus is forming. The extra chromosome can come from either the egg or the sperm. Scientists think this happens by chance. The condition doesn't usually run in families. T he risk goes up for parents over 35, but it could affect your pregnancy at any age ."", ""It can affect some of the body's cells, or all of them: Full trisomy 13, the most common form, is when the extra chromosome is in all cells. Mosaic trisomy 13 is when the extra chromosome is in some cells. Partial trisomy 13 is when the baby inherits only part of the extra chromosome. Sometimes, chromosome 13 detaches from one cell and moves to another. This is known as translocation. This type has been linked to heredity."", ""Trisomy 13 Symptoms The symptoms of trisomy 13 affect many body systems and parts. The more cells in your baby's body that have the extra chromosome, the more serious their symptoms will be. Babies born with trisomy 13 tend to have a low birth weight and brain structure problems, which affect their facial development. About 80% of babies born with trisomy 13 have heart problems. Cleft lip or palate is also common. Other physical symptoms include: Eyes that are set close together A nose or nostrils that aren't fully developed Clenched hands Small eyes, head, or lower jaw Low-set ears Extra toes or fingers Low muscle tone Missing skin on the scalp Hernias A hole or split in the iris of the eye Palms with one crease instead of the usual three Undescended testicle An abnormal skeleton"", ""Trisomy 13 Diagnosis Your doctor might notice physical signs of trisomy 13 during your regular first-trimester fetal ultrasounds. If your fetus is at risk of having abnormal chromosomes, your doctor may do screening tests such as cell-free DNA screening (NIPT) or the PAPP-A (pregnancy-associated plasma protein A). But these tests can’t tell your doctor whether your fetus definitely has trisomy 13. They can only show that it's more likely. To make sure, your doctor will likely recommend a karyotype test, such as a chorionic villus sampling (CVS) or amniocentesis, the most common diagnostic test for trisomy 13. If you didn't have genetic testing during pregnancy, the diagnosis is confirmed after your baby is born, when the doctor can look at their symptoms."", ""Trisomy 13 Treatment There's no cure for trisomy 13. Treatment depends on what kind of symptoms your child has. It might include: Medications to ease symptoms Physical, speech, or behavior therapy Surgery for physical issues Support with education Depending on how serious the issues are, some parents and doctors may choose to wait on considering any treatment based on the chances of the baby’s survival."", 'Trisomy 13 Complications Complications from trisomy 13 start at birth. Most babies with the condition are born with heart disease. The extra 13th chromosome also causes other serious physical problems, such as: A hard time breathing Congenital heart defects Hearing loss High blood pressure ( hypertension ) Intellectual disabilities Pneumonia Seizures and other neurological problems Slow growth Trouble feeding or digesting food', 'Trisomy 13 Life Expectancy Doctors can’t predict how long a baby with trisomy 13 might live if they don’t have any immediate life-threatening problems. More than 80% of babies with the condition don’t live past their first month, and only 5%-10% live past age 1. About 10% live more than 5 years. Nutrition treatment and surgery can increase survival for babies with trisomy 13. But children with the condition rarely live into their teens.', ""Where to Find Support Support from friends, family, and others who've been there can help you deal with the trauma that a diagnosis of trisomy 13 can bring. It may also help to learn more about the condition. Some places to start are: SOFT (Support Organization for Trisomy 18, 13, and Related Disorders) , a group that helps families affected by trisomy 13 share information and find referrals for care Hope for Trisomy , which helps families connect with one another and find information and news about the condition. UNIQUE (Understanding Rare Chromosome and Gene Disorders), an international organization dedicated to rare chromosome conditions like trisomy 13 that produces a newsletter and works to raise awareness about these diseases Other organizations such as the National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD) and the National Institutes of Health’s Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center (GARD) have information and links to resources about trisomy 13 as well."", ""Takeaways If your baby has trisomy 13, they may have serious mental and physical problems. It can be found in your first trimester of pregnancy. There's no cure for trisomy 13. But there are treatments, including surgery and therapy, that focus on easing symptoms and providing comfort to your baby."", 'Trisomy 13 FAQs Why is trisomy 13 so fatal? Trisomy 13 disrupts a baby’s development in the womb. They grow slowly, are born severely underweight, and have many serious medical problems. That’s why trisomy 13 often results in miscarriage, stillbirth, or death soon after birth. What age is the longest-living child with trisomy 13? The longest-living person with trisomy 13 was recorded in a 1981 journal article as being 19 years old. How long your baby survives depends on their medical complications and what form of trisomy 13 they have. Despite the many challenges that face them, there are babies born with trisomy 13 who do progress. About 5%-10% of babies live past their first year.', 'Is trisomy 13 a type of Down syndrome? No, but both are conditions in which three chromosomes are present instead of two. Down syndrome, also known medically as trisomy 21, affects the 21st chromosome.']"
1,Dandruff: Learn the Basics,"[""Dandruff -- those dry, white flakes of skin you brush off your collar or shoulders -- is harmless. But it can be embarrassing and itchy. Dandruff really isn't about your hair , or how often you wash it. Instead, it's about the skin on your scalp. Skin cells that grow and die off too fast are the cause of dandruff, but doctors don't know why this happens. A fungus is one possible cause. Skin cells that grow and die off too fast are the problem. Exactly why that happens isn't clear. A very common fungus called malassezia may contribute to dandruff. This fungus lives on the scalp of most healthy adults without causing any problems. One theory is that the immune system of someone with dandruff may overreact to that fungus. Dandruff may get worse when you're stressed or sick. Cold, dry winters can trigger dandruff or make it worse, too. One common cause is seborrheic dermatitis , or seborrhea. Some people with dandruff may also have seborrheic dermatitis in other areas of the body, such as their ears, the center of the face, and the center of the chest.""]"
2,Dengue Fever,"['Dengue (pronounced DENgee) fever is a painful, debilitating mosquito-borne disease caused by any one of four closely related dengue viruses. These viruses are related to the viruses that cause West Nile infection and yellow fever . An estimated 400 million dengue infections occur worldwide each year, with about 96 million resulting in illness. Most cases occur in tropical areas of the world, with the greatest risk occurring in: The Indian subcontinent Southeast Asia Southern China Taiwan The Pacific Islands The Caribbean (except Cuba and the Cayman Islands) Mexico Africa Central and South America (except Chile, Paraguay, and Argentina) Most cases in the United States occur in people who contracted the infection while traveling abroad. But the risk is increasing for people living along the Texas-Mexico border and in other parts of the southern United States. In 2014, an outbreak of dengue fever was identified in Hawaii with other outbreaks in 2013 in Brownsville, Texas, and Key West, Fla. The Centers for Disease Control reported about 2,000 total cases in the U.S. and U.S. territories in 2022. Dengue fever is transmitted by the bite of an Aedes mosquito infected with a dengue virus. The mosquito becomes infected when it bites a person with dengue virus in their blood . It can’t be spread directly from one person to another person.', 'Symptoms of Dengue Fever Symptoms, which usually begin four to six days after infection and last for up to 10 days, may include Sudden, high fever Severe headaches Pain behind the eyes Severe joint and muscle pain Fatigue Nausea Vomiting Skin rash , which appears two to five days after the onset of fever Mild bleeding (such a nose bleed, bleeding gums , or easy bruising) Sometimes, symptoms are mild and can be mistaken for those of the flu or another viral infection . Younger children and people who have never had the infection before tend to have milder cases than older children and adults. However, serious problems can develop. These include dengue hemorrhagic fever, a rare complication characterized by high fever , damage to lymph and blood vessels, bleeding from the nose and gums, enlargement of the liver , and failure of the circulatory system. The symptoms may progress to massive bleeding, shock, and death. This is called dengue shock syndrome (DSS). People with weakened immune systems as well as those with a second or subsequent dengue infection are believed to be at greater risk for developing dengue hemorrhagic fever.', 'Diagnosing Dengue Fever Doctors can diagnose dengue infection with a blood test to check for the virus or antibodies to it. If you become sick after traveling to a tropical area, let your doctor know. This will allow your doctor to evaluate the possibility that your symptoms were caused by a dengue infection.', 'Treatment for Dengue Fever There is no specific medicine to treat dengue infection. If you think you may have dengue fever, you should use pain relievers with acetaminophen and avoid medicines with aspirin , which could worsen bleeding. You should also rest, drink plenty of fluids, and see your doctor. If you start to feel worse in the first 24 hours after your fever goes down, you should get to a hospital immediately to be checked for complications.', 'Preventing Dengue Fever The best way to prevent the disease is to prevent bites by infected mosquitoes, particularly if you are living in or traveling to a tropical area. This involves protecting yourself and making efforts to keep the mosquito population down.\xa0In 2019, the FDA approved a vaccine called Dengvaxia to help\xa0prevent the disease from occurring in adolescents aged 9 to 16 who have already been infected by dengue. But, there currently is no vaccine to prevent the general population from contracting it.', ""To protect yourself: Use mosquito repellents, even indoors. When outdoors, wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants tucked into socks. When indoors, use air conditioning if available. Make sure window and door screens are secure and free of holes. If sleeping areas are not screened or air conditioned, use mosquito nets. If you have symptoms of dengue, speak to your doctor. To reduce the mosquito population, get rid of places where mosquitoes can breed. These include old tires, cans, or flower pots that collect rain. Regularly change the water in outdoor bird baths and pets' water dishes. If someone in your home gets dengue fever, be especially vigilant about efforts to protect yourself and other family members from mosquitoes. Mosquitoes that bite the infected family member could spread the infection to others in your home.""]"
3,DASH Diet and High Blood Pressure,"['One of the steps your doctor may recommend to lower your high blood pressure is to start using the DASH diet . DASH stands for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (high blood pressure). The diet is simple: Eat more fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy foods Cut back on foods that are high in saturated fat , cholesterol, and trans fats Eat more whole-grain foods, fish, poultry, and nuts Limit sodium, sweets, sugary drinks, and red meats In research studies, people who were on the DASH diet lowered their blood pressure within 2 weeks. Another diet -- DASH-Sodium -- calls for cutting back sodium to 1,500 milligrams a day (about 2/3 teaspoon). Studies of people on the DASH-Sodium plan lowered their blood pressure as well.', ""Starting the DASH Diet The DASH diet calls for a certain number of servings daily from various food groups. The number of servings you require may vary, depending on how many calories you need per day. You can make gradual changes. For instance, start by limiting yourself to 2,400 milligrams of sodium per day (about 1 teaspoon). Then, once your body has adjusted to the diet, cut back to 1,500 milligrams of sodium per day (about 2/3 teaspoon). These amounts include all sodium eaten, including sodium in food products as well as in what you cook with or add at the table. DASH diet tips Add a serving of vegetables at lunch and at dinner. Add a serving of fruit to your meals or as a snack. Canned and dried fruits are easy to use, but check that they don't have added sugar. Use only half your typical serving of butter, margarine, or salad dressing, and use low-fat or fat-free condiments . Drink low-fat or skim dairy products any time you would normally use full-fat or cream. Limit meat to 6 ounces a day. Make some meals vegetarian. Add more vegetables and dry beans to your diet. Instead of snacking on chips or sweets, eat unsalted pretzels or nuts, raisins, low-fat and fat-free yogurt, frozen yogurt, unsalted plain popcorn with no butter, and raw vegetables. Read food labels to choose products that are lower in sodium."", 'Staying on the DASH Diet The DASH diet suggests getting: Grains: 7-8 daily servings Vegetables: 4-5 daily servings Fruits: 4-5 daily servings Low-fat or fat-free dairy products: 2-3 daily servings Meat, poultry, and fish: 2 or less daily servings Nuts, seeds, and dry beans: 4-5 servings per week Fats and oils : 2-3 daily servings Sweets: try to limit to less than 5 servings per week', 'How Much Is a Serving? When you\'re trying to follow a healthy eating plan, it helps to know how much of a certain kind of food is considered a ""serving."" One serving is: 1/2 cup cooked rice or pasta 1 slice bread 1 cup raw vegetables or fruit 1/2 cup cooked veggies or fruit 8 ounces of milk 1 teaspoon of olive oil (or any other oil) 3 ounces cooked meat 3 ounces tofu']"
4,What to Know About Day Care,"[""Your child's earliest experiences will play a big part in their development. They will build the foundation for your child's future success. Most of these experiences are the early home parenting and nurturing experiences that you give your child. But other kinds of experiences, like day care, are also a developmental influence. Many parents who work outside the home use day care. Some choose a day care based on its ability to prepare kids for a future school. Though the most common reason for day care placement is two working parents, some professionals may recommend that a child be enrolled in day care because of developmental or social needs . There's a lot to consider when choosing a high-quality day care for your child."", ""What Is Day Care? A day care center is a business that's often located in a commercial building. It's where parents take their young children for care during daily business hours. The center is large and can provide care for more children than family child care providers. It’s usually separated into groups of similarly aged kids. It usually has several staff members or providers managed by a director. The day care might be privately owned, part of a church, in a public school, or part of an agency of the government. Licensed day care centers are available in all states. But not every center is licensed. Examples of day care programs that could be operational but not licensed include: Faith-based programs Early childhood centers run by schools Part-time programs like preschools, nursery schools, and prekindergarten programs School-age before- and after-school programs Summer camp"", ""Types of Day Care There are three regular nonparental child care businesses used by families in the U.S. Each has advantages and disadvantages, and some work well for some families, while some don’t. A good day care arrangement will match the child's needs and the family's needs. Center-based child care: This is a group child care program that has part-time or full-time care providers. They are licensed by standards that regulate safety, health, space, and staffing. Family child care: This care is provided in a different home than the one in which the child lives. If the home cares for more than three unrelated children, the provider must be licensed, depending on the state location. In-home child care: This care takes place in the home of the child. Sometimes the caregiver is a relative of the child, or they could be a nanny."", 'Day Care Benefits There are many advantages of sending your child to day care: A variety of playmates Staff who are well trained and can establish appropriate developmental programs for children Reliability in being open year-round without fluctuations due to vacation or sickness Parent involvement in policy and curriculum Extra services when available, like field trips, music, health screenings , and more The most important benefit of choosing a day care is the quality provided by a stellar day care. The needs of your child depend on their age, but a high-quality day care will have certain characteristics. This includes caregiving that is responsive and sensitive, stimulates the senses, and has a safe, healthy environment. A high-quality day care has long-term benefits like: Increased language development Increased cognitive abilities Development of good peer relationships Decreased incidents with the caregivers', ""Day Care Pros and Cons Parents who work traditional shifts find convenience in day care. Parents who work different shifts and need part-time care, late hours, or weekend care may have a hard time locating a day care that can meet these needs. A typical day care is open from around 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. You have to pay for that day or week. Usually, there's no flexibility in picking and choosing the hours you need specifically. Centers have a very structured and organized setup. They don't always have the ability to focus on individual routines, needs, or interests. Your children may get used to a certain provider and grow fond of them. But there may be a high turnover rate during the day. Day cares of lower quality are more often associated with negative outcomes. Low-quality centers may have child disadvantages like: Decreased language skills Increased behavioral problems Decreased cognitive performance Decreased school readiness scores"", ""Day Care Tips To find a high-quality day care, you should visit your state's department of human services website. You can search for providers by zip code and locate regulations for provider types. You also can peruse the\xa0National Association for Family Child Care site\xa0to learn more about the accreditation and licensing of good providers in your area."", ""It's important to remember that accreditation and ratings only provide a partial explanation of the type of child care your child will receive. Responsive and warm caregiving is equally important in childcare quality, just like good parenting. When choosing a day care center for your child, you should consider the following: Visit the center. Look for clues about positive caregiving. Listen to the language the caregiver uses because this is connected to positive outcomes and high-quality care. Higher-quality facilities are usually linked to higher regulations and certifications. Check to see if the day care is licensed. Don't assume all day cares are high-quality. Do your research. Compare home-based centers with child care centers and really weigh the pros and cons. When dealing with a child with special needs , families have to remember: An increase in a child's hours of day care has not been linked to an improvement in their development. Beginning day care after a year of age might give a child additional time to learn how to handle their behavior at home first."", ""It's important to remember that, whether your child attends day care or not, the most important aspect of childcare is what happens at home. Home life is important in child development. Interactions with parents and siblings are key. An attentive parent who provides a lot of back-and-forth interaction and good communication counts for a lot. These child-parent interactions predict a child's development more than any day care considerations do.""]"
5,Diamond-Blackfan Anemia,"[""When you have anemia , your body doesn't make enough red blood cells , or the ones you do have aren’t working like they should. Red blood cells are key because they carry oxygen to your body. Without them, you can feel tired and short of breath. Your red blood cells are made in the spongy tissue inside your bones called marrow. Diamond-Blackfan anemia , or DBA , is a type of anemia that’s caused when your bone marrow can't make enough red blood cells to meet your body’s needs."", 'What Causes Diamond-Blackfan Anemia? Diamond-Blackfan anemia, also known as acquired pure red cell aplasia, is usually diagnosed when a child is less than a year old. It’s caused by changes, or mutations, in their genes, which are the building blocks of DNA. Sometimes the genetic mutation is passed down from one parent to a child. But sometimes the genes change on their own. About half of DBA cases have a known genetic cause, but some people don’t know what causes their DBA.', 'Symptoms of DBA People with DBA have many of the same symptoms as other types of anemia, including fatigue , pale skin , and weakness. Some children born with DBA also have physical effects to their face and body, such as: A small head Wide eyes and a flat nose Small, low ears Small bottom jaw Short, webbed neck Small shoulder blades Abnormal thumbs Cleft palate or lip Other symptoms of DBA can include kidney problems, heart defects, and eye problems such as cataracts and glaucoma . Boys can also have hypospadias, a defect that is there from birth, where the opening for their urinary tract isn’t at the tip of their penis .', 'How Is It Diagnosed? Your doctor can use several tests to find out if your child has DBA, usually before age 1. Children with DBA have a low number of red blood cells, but normal white blood cells and platelets. Your doctor will likely take a complete blood count, or CBC . It’s a blood test that looks at different parts of blood. This test measures several things, including: The number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets A protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen, called hemoglobin The amount of space the red blood cells take up in blood, or hematocrit The size of the red blood cells', 'A few other blood tests your doctor can use to help diagnose DBA include: Reticulocyte count. This test measures the number of young red blood cells. It can tell whether your child’s bone marrow is making enough red blood cells. Erythrocyte adenosine deaminase (eADA) levels. About 80% of people with DBA have high levels of an enzyme called erythrocyte adenosine deaminase. This test measures the erythrocyte adenosine deaminase levels (eADA) in your child’s blood. Fetal hemoglobin levels . Fetal hemoglobin is the type of hemoglobin babies have while in the womb. After birth, levels of this hemoglobin should drop. Many children with DBA still have high levels of fetal hemoglobin, even as they get older. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy . During this test, a small amount of cells and fluid are removed from the bone marrow with a needle. A technician looks at the samples to see how many red blood cells and other cells are in the marrow, and how healthy they are. Children with DBA will have fewer than normal healthy red blood cells in their bone marrow. Genetic tests. These tests check for DBA genes, or genes for other types of anemia that are passed from parents to children.', ""What Are the Complications of DBA? People with DBA are more likely to end up with certain diseases and conditions, including cancer of the blood and bone marrow ( acute myeloid leukemia ), bone cancer ( osteosarcoma ), and other disorders in which the bone marrow doesn't make enough healthy blood cells ( myelodysplastic syndrome )."", ""Treatments Children diagnosed with DBA are able to live long lives with medical treatment. And some go into complete remission , meaning the symptoms disappear for a time. Two common treatments are blood transfusion therapy and corticosteroid medication . Some people might also consider a bone marrow transplant , although it is riskier. And finding a matching donor is often difficult. You should discuss all options with your doctor. Corticosteroid drugs. Medications like prednisone (Rayos, Sterapred ) can help make bone marrow produce more red blood cells. Blood transfusion. If steroid drugs don't work, or your child’s anemia becomes more severe, a blood transfusion is an option. Whole blood or red blood cells from a healthy donor can take the place of the blood cells your child’s body isn't making. Bone marrow/ stem cell transplant. This treatment replaces damaged bone marrow with healthy stem cells from a donor. It is the only cure for DBA.""]"
6,Hearing Loss,"[""What Is Hearing Loss? Hearing loss is the condition that results when any part of your ear isn’t working the way it should. It’s the third most common health problem in the U.S, and it can affect the quality of your life and relationships. About 48 million Americans have lost some hearing. You can have three different types of hearing loss , depending on where your hearing is damaged. Your hearing loss can be: Conductive if it involves your outer or middle ear Sensorineural if it involves your inner ear Mixed if it involves a combination of the two Certain conditions, including age, illness, and genetics, may play a role in hearing loss. Modern life has added a host of ear-damaging elements to the list, including some medications and many sources of loud, ongoing noise.\xa0Learn more about the common causes of hearing loss . With so many untreatable cases of hearing loss, prevention is the best way to keep hearing long-term. If you've already lost some hearing, there are ways to stay connected and communicate with friends and family."", 'Hearing Loss Symptoms In many cases, hearing fades so slowly you don\'t notice it. You may think people are mumbling more, your spouse needs to speak up, or you need a better phone. As long as some sound still comes in, you could assume your hearing is fine. But you may become more and more cut off from the world of speech and sounds.\xa0So how do you know if you are losing your hearing ? Doctors classify hearing loss by degrees. Mild hearing loss: One-on-one conversations are fine, but it\'s hard to catch every word when there\'s background noise. Moderate hearing loss: You often need to ask people to repeat themselves during conversations in person and on the phone. Severe hearing loss : Following a conversation is almost impossible unless you have a hearing aid. Profound hearing loss: You can\'t hear other people speaking unless they’re extremely loud. You can\'t understand what they\'re saying without a hearing aid or cochlear implant.\xa0Learn more about how much hearing loss is considered deaf . Early on, high-pitched sounds, such as children\'s and female voices, and the sounds ""S"" and ""F"" become harder to make out. You may also: Have trouble following a conversation when more than one person speaks at once Think other people are mumbling or not speaking clearly Often misunderstand what others say and respond inappropriately Get complaints that the TV is too loud Hear ringing, roaring, or hissing sounds in your ears, known as tinnitus', ""Hearing Loss Causes Your ear has three main areas that play a part in hearing. Sound waves go through your: Outer ear where they cause vibrations in your eardrum. Middle ear , which gets the vibrations next. They’re boosted by three small bones. Inner ear , which houses the cochlea, a snail-shaped fluid-filled structure. It has tiny hairs that change the amplified vibrations into electrical signals and send them to your brain , where you hear them as sound. Advanced age is the most common cause of hearing loss. One out of three people between 65 and 74 has some level of hearing loss. After age 75, that goes up to one out of every two people. Researchers don't fully understand why hearing declines with age. It could be that lifetime exposure to noise and other damaging factors slowly wears down the ears' delicate mechanics. Your genes are also part of the mix. Noise wears down hearing if it's loud or continuous. The CDC reports that about 22 million American workers are exposed to dangerous noise levels on the job. This includes many carpenters, construction workers, soldiers, miners, factory workers, and farmers."", ""Musicians are also at risk for noise-induced hearing loss. Some now wear special earplugs to protect their ears when they perform. The earplugs allow them to hear music without harming their ears' inner workings. Certain medications can impair hearing or balance. More than 200 drugs and chemicals have a track record of triggering hearing and balance side effects in addition to their disease-fighting abilities. Some antibiotics Some chemotherapy drugs Aspirin Loop diuretics A drug used to treat malaria Several drugs for erectile dysfunction Sudden hearing loss, the rapid loss of 30 decibels or more of hearing ability, can happen over several hours or up to 3 days. (A normal conversation is 60 decibels.) Sudden hearing loss usually affects only one ear. Although there are up to three new cases per every 10,000 people each year, doctors are not able to discover the cause in most cases. Illnesses such as heart disease , high blood pressure , and diabetes put ears at risk by interfering with the ears' blood supply. Otosclerosis is a bone disease of the middle ear, and Ménière's disease affects the inner ear. Both can cause hearing loss. Trauma, especially a skull fracture or punctured eardrum, puts ears at serious risk for hearing loss. Infection or earwax can block ear canals and lessen hearing."", 'Hearing Loss Diagnosis To figure out how much of your hearing you’ve lost, your doctor can do the following tests: Physical exam to look in your ear for earwax buildup, infection, or structural problems. General screening tests that involve covering one ear at a time to see how well you hear spoken words at different volumes. Tuning fork tests using two-pronged metal instruments that make a sound when you tap them. Your doctor can tell how well you hear them. The test can also help pinpoint where in your ear the hearing loss is. Audiometer tests where you wear earphones and listen for sounds directed into your ear. This test is done by an audiologist and can measure the level of sound you can hear more accurately than other screening tests. There are also tablet and smartphone apps you can use on your own to screen for hearing loss.', ""Hearing Loss Treatments How you’re treated depends on the type and source of your hearing loss. Prompt medical treatment for sudden hearing loss may raise your chance of recovery. Surgery may reverse hearing loss caused by otosclerosis, scar tissue, or infection, while Ménière's disease is sometimes treatable with medication and a different diet.\xa0Learn more about the latest treatments for hearing loss . Antibiotics can often clear up hearing loss caused by infection. Changing medications may help if you think your hearing loss stems from one you’re taking. Talk with your doctor about different drug options. Removing ear wax with suction or a small looped tool can reverse hearing loss caused by a blockage. A hearing aid helps most people with permanent hearing loss. You typically wear these tiny instruments in or behind your ear to make sounds louder. Things do sound different through a hearing aid, so talk to your doctor to set realistic goals. Other sound-enhancing technologies that may improve your hearing include personal listening systems that allow you to tune in to what you want to hear and mute other sounds. TV-listening systems make it possible for you to hear the television or radio without turning up the volume. Different kinds of phone-amplifying devices as well as captioned phones that let you read what your caller is saying make conversations possible on home and mobile phones. Cochlear implants are used mainly with young children, but they're becoming more popular among older adults with profound hearing loss."", 'Hearing Loss Complications Not being able to hear the world around you can affect your quality of life. It can cause feelings of depression and isolation, especially in older adults. Over time, you can start to have problems with your mental function. Studies that look at treating hearing loss show that as your hearing gets better, so does your brain function, especially your memory.', ""Living With Hearing Loss For starters, set up your home so your rooms are well lit and places to sit face each other. When people talk, watch their mouths move as well as their facial expressions. Remove sources of background noise you don’t need. For instance, turn off the TV when no one's watching it. Let people know what they can do to help you understand them better: Get your attention before they start talking. Make sure you can see their lips moving. Speak clearly, but don't shout."", ""Hearing Loss Prevention Hearing loss is often permanent, so do what you can to protect one of your most valuable natural assets. Wear earplugs when you're around sounds as loud or louder than traffic. Lawn mowers, power sanders, vacuums, and most concerts are all loud enough to harm unprotected ears. When possible, move away from the source of the noise. For example, cross the street or cover your ears when you walk past a loud road construction site."", ""If your workplace is noisy, talk to your employer about ear safety. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) recommends that employers install barrier walls or mufflers in noisy plants to protect their workers' hearing. Be aware that recreational activities also come with high noise levels. Things to watch out for include video arcades, fireworks displays, live music concerts, sporting events, music from your headphones, and even some children’s toys. If you know you’re going to be somewhere noisy, limit your time there and wear ear protection. As a general rule, if you have to shout to be heard 3 feet away, it’s too loud.""]"
7,"Pressure Sores: Treatment, Stages, and Symptoms","['What Are Pressure Sores? You may know pressure sores by their more common name: bedsores. Also sometimes called pressure ulcers, they happen when you lie or sit in one position too long and the weight of your body against the surface of the bed or chair cuts off blood supply. You might get them if you\'re on bed rest or in a wheelchair. Your doctor may talk about the ""stage"" of your pressure sores. The stages are based on how deep the sores are, which can affect how they\'re treated. If found early, there\'s a good chance these sores will heal in a few days, with little fuss or pain . Without treatment, they can get worse.', 'Pressure Sores Causes Pressure sores happen when your skin is pressed against a surface (like a mattress or a cushion) for a long period. This makes it hard for blood flow to reach that area of skin. As a result, skin cells begin to die, and the area becomes sensitive. Pressure sores can show up in a few days or even just a few hours.', ""A few things contribute to pressure sores: Pressure. Even if it doesn't feel like you're putting a lot of weight on a certain body part, over time, the force adds up. The pressure squeezes your skin, making it hard for blood to flow through that area. Without proper blood flow, your skin can't get enough oxygen or nutrients. This weakens the skin and causes cells to die. Rubbing. Rubbing, even from blankets or clothing, can damage sensitive skin. This could be especially harmful if the skin is moist from sweat. Stretched skin. When two surfaces slide against each other, it can cause your skin to pull or stretch. For instance, you might slide down a raised bed, aggravating the skin on your tailbone. Common areas of pressure ulcers Pressure sores tend to form in bony parts of your body, like the skin covering your spine and tailbone. These places don't have a lot of fat or muscle padding. The places where you get them depend on your position."", ""If you spend most of your time in bed, you're most likely to find them on your: Head (where it rests against the pillow) Shoulder blades Hips Tailbone and butt Back of the knees Ankles Heels If you stay in a wheelchair for long periods, you might get them on your: Shoulder blades Spine Arms or legs (where they touch the chair) You also can get pressure sores from devices that press against your skin for long periods. For example, wearing an oxygen mask can lead to pressure sores on your nose, your ears, or the back of your head. Oral devices (like poor-fitting dentures) can cause sores in your mouth."", ""Pressure Sores Risk Factors Some people are more likely to get pressure sores than others. Things that can raise your risk of pressure sores include: Immobility. This is when you have difficulty moving. You might spend a lot of time in a position that puts pressure on a certain body part. Incontinence. This is when you can't control your bladder or bowels. Moisture from pee and poop could irritate your skin, especially if you're not able to clean up right away. Poor nutrition and hydration. Your skin (and the rest of your body) needs a healthy diet with plenty of nutrients and water. Without these, it will get weak and fragile. Loss of physical feeling. Pain, discomfort, and other sensations tell your body when it's time to shift position. Some health conditions, like spinal cord injuries, can dull your ability to feel. As a result, you might not realize when pressure builds up on a certain body part. Blood flow problems. Some conditions, like diabetes and vascular disease, make it hard for blood to travel throughout your body. This raises the risk that certain positions might cut off your blood flow, causing pressure sores. Thin or weakened skin. Wearing a cast or prosthetic device could cause your skin to weaken. This makes your skin more vulnerable to pressure and irritation."", 'What health conditions raise your risk of bedsores? Certain diseases make it hard to move or get out of bed. They might cause immobility, blood flow problems, and other things that raise your risk of pressure sores. These conditions include: Cancer Cerebral palsy Coma Dementia Diabetes Heart failure Kidney failure Malnutrition Paralysis Spinal cord injury or spina bifida Vascular problems', ""Pressure Sores Stages and Symptoms There are four stages of pressure sores from mild to severe: Stage I This is the mildest stage. These pressure sores only affect the upper layer of your skin. Symptoms: Pain, burning, or itching are common symptoms. The spot may also feel different from the surrounding skin: firmer or softer, warmer or cooler. You may notice a red area on your skin. If you have darker skin, the discolored area may be harder to see. The spot doesn't get lighter when you press on it or even 10-30 minutes after you stop pressing. This means less blood is getting to the area."", ""Stage II This happens when the sore digs deeper below the surface of your skin. Symptoms: Your skin is broken, has an open wound, or looks like a pus-filled blister. The skin around it may be discolored. The area is swollen, warm, and/or red. The sore may ooze clear fluid or pus. And it's painful. Stage III These sores have gone through the second layer of skin into the fat tissue. Symptoms: The sore looks like a crater and may have a bad odor. It may show signs of infection: red edges, pus, odor, heat, and/or drainage. The tissue in or around the sore is black if it has died. Stage IV These sores are the most serious. Some may even go so deep they affect your muscles, ligaments, and bones. Symptoms: The sore is deep and big. Skin has turned black and shows signs of infection—red edges, pus, odor, heat, and/or drainage. You may be able to see tendons, muscles, and bone."", ""Other stages In addition to the four main stages for bed sores, there are two others: Unstageable is when you can't see the bottom of the sore because it's covered in a layer of dead skin. Your doctor can only stage it once it's cleaned out. Suspected deep tissue injury is when the surface of the skin looks like a stage I or II sore, but underneath the surface, it's a stage III or IV sore."", ""Pressure Sores Diagnosis To diagnose a pressure sore, your doctor will examine your skin. They might ask questions like: When did the sore appear? Does it hurt? How often do you change positions? Have you ever had a pressure sore before? Your doctor will consider your symptoms. Then they'll determine whether you have a pressure sore, and if so, what stage it's in. They might take a picture to record its healing progress. If your doctor is worried you might have an infection, they might do: Blood tests Biopsies to take a sample of tissue for testing Imaging, such as an X-ray or MRI, to get a picture of what's happening under your skin"", 'Pressure Sores Complications When left untreated, pressure sores can lead to other problems such as: Skin infections. Open wounds can let bacteria in and lead to bacterial infections like cellulitis or septicemia. You might notice the area becoming warm, swollen, and inflamed. Sepsis. If left untreated, infections can lead to sepsis, when your body starts to attack its own tissues instead of fighting the bacteria causing the infection. Amputation. Sepsis can be so bad that you have to have a limb removed. Bacteria in your bloodstream. This can lead to serious problems like bacterial meningitis or endocarditis . These diseases affect the brain and heart. Bone and joint infections. Pressure sores can allow infections to enter nearby bones or joints. These kinds of infections can damage tissues and affect your ability to move. Cancer. Rarely, wounds that take a very long time to heal can turn into a type of skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma. Signs of an infected bedsore Infection can cause: Fluid leaking from the sore Fever Bad smell Warm skin near the wound Changes in skin color Swelling Pain', ""Pressure Sores Treatment How you treat a pressure sore depends on what stage it's in. Stage I The first and most important thing to do with any pressure sore is to stop the pressure. Change your position or use foam pads, pillows, or mattresses. If you spend a lot of time in bed, try to move at least once every 2 hours. If you're sitting, move every 15 minutes. You may need someone to help you."", 'Wash the sore with mild soap and water and dry it gently. It may help to eat a diet high in protein, vitamins A and C, and the minerals iron and zinc. These are all good for your skin. Also, drink plenty of water. Stage II Clean the wound with a saline (saltwater) solution and dry it gently. Keep the sore covered with a bandage. Ask your doctor what type is best—films, gauze, gel, foam, or medicated. If you see signs of an infection, such as pus, fever, or redness, tell your doctor.', ""Stage III Stage III sores will need more care, so you should see your doctor. They may remove any dead tissue. This is called debridement. They'll numb the surrounding skin first, then use a scalpel to remove the dead skin or special ointments to dissolve it. Your doctor also might prescribe antibiotics to fight infection. You may also be able to get a special bed or mattress through your insurance. Stage IV Tell your doctor right away. These wounds need immediate attention, and you may need surgery. Pressure sore medications Pressure sores can be painful. To help with the pain, you can try nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen (Advil) and naproxen sodium (Aleve). Take them before changing positions or cleaning your wound. Your doctor could also prescribe pain relievers in the form of a cream or ointment. If your bedsore becomes infected, you might need prescription antibiotics. Pressure sore surgical treatments If you have a large pressure sore that doesn't go away, you might need a surgery called a skin graft. The surgeon takes muscle or skin from a different part of your body and uses it to cover the sore. This closes the wound and cushions it."", ""Pressure Sores Prevention There are some easy ways to prevent pressure sores. The most important one is to regularly change positions. Here are some tips: Reposition yourself often. Move around every 15 minutes (if you're in a wheelchair) or every hour (if you're in bed). Don't be afraid to ask for help."", ""Get a specialized wheelchair. Look for chairs that you can tilt back, allowing you to shift your weight more easily. Use cushions. Cushions and specialized mattresses can help distribute your weight, relieving pressure. They also can support your body in comfortable positions. But don't use doughnut cushions—these actually build pressure on the surrounding area. Keep\xa0the head of your bed low. Don't raise the head of your bed (or tilt your pillows) to more than a 30° angle. This prevents you from sliding down the bed, which could strain the skin surrounding the tailbone. If possible, lift yourself. If you're in a wheelchair and have enough upper body strength, you can do wheelchair pushups. This is when you press your forearms against the arms of the chair to lift your body from the seat."", ""Other ways to prevent pressure sores include: Stay clean and dry. Even if you can't bathe regularly, use a daily cleansing towel to wipe away sweat, dirt, and other buildup. Pat dry when done. If you have incontinence, apply a moisture barrier ointment. This will protect your skin from pee and poop. Avoid irritating the skin. Look for buttons, zippers, bumps in the fabric, and other things that could cause rubbing. Wash your blankets and clothes frequently. Eat a healthy diet and drink plenty of water. Staying well-nourished and hydrated will help your skin stay strong. Keep an eye on your skin. Check yourself (or ask someone else to check) for signs of bedsores.

8,What Is Tularemia?,"['Tularemia is a rare infectious disease that can attack your skin , lungs , eyes , and lymph nodes . Sometimes it’s called rabbit fever or deer fly fever . It’s caused by a bacteria called Francisella tularensis .', 'Causes People can become sick with tularemia, but it’s not a disease that naturally occurs in humans. It often affects rabbits and other animals including rodents, sheep, and birds. House pets like dogs and cats can get tularemia too. These are some of the ways people can get it: Insect bites , especially from a deer fly or tick Coming into contact with the skin, hair , or meat of an animal that’s infected Consuming contaminated water or food, such as undercooked meat Breathing in bacteria that comes up from the soil during an activity like construction or gardening It’s also possible to become infected if you’re exposed to the bacteria in a laboratory setting, or potentially, in an act of bioterrorism. Tularemia can happen anywhere in the world, but it’s most common in rural areas where animals are more likely to be infected with the bacteria. It can survive in soil, water , and dead animals for weeks. That’s why it can cause infections in so many different ways. The way you become infected with the disease influences the type of symptoms you’ll have and how severe they may be. But just because you’re exposed to the bacteria doesn’t mean you’ll become sick with the disease.', 'Symptoms If you do become sick after being exposed to Francisella tularensis , you’re likely to start having symptoms within 3 to 5 days, but it can take up to 2 weeks. There are different types of tularemia that each have their own specific symptoms. Ulceroglandular tularemia is the most common variety of the disease. Symptoms can include: An ulcer on the skin that’s usually caused by a bite from an infected animal or insect Lymph glands that are painful and swollen Fever Chills Headache Fatigue Oculoglandular tularemia affects the eyes . Symptoms can include: Pain , swelling, or discharge in the eye Redness in the eye Light sensitivity An ulcer that forms inside the eyelid Tender lymph glands around the ear, neck, and jaw', 'Oropharyngeal tularemia affects the mouth , throat, and digestive system . It’s the form of the disease that’s most often caused by eating undercooked meat from a wild animal or drinking water that’s contaminated. Symptoms can include: Throat pain Vomiting Diarrhea Swollen tonsils or lymph nodes in the neck Ulcers in the mouth Fever', 'Pneumonic tularemia can cause symptoms that are often associated with pneumonia , including: Trouble breathing Pain in the chest A dry cough Typhoidal tularemia is a rare, but very serious form of the disease. Symptoms can include: An enlarged spleen or liver Diarrhea and vomiting Severe fatigue Elevated fever', 'Who’s at Risk? Tularemia is rare. There are only about 200 cases reported each year in the United States. People get it most from tick bites or contact with a contaminated animal. The following can also increase your risk for developing tularemia: Jobs such as laboratory worker, farmer, veterinarian, hunter, landscaper, wildlife manager, and meat handler Living in or visiting the south-central United States Hunting or gardening. Wild animals may be infected with tularemia, and stirring up soil may cause bacteria to be released.', 'Diagnosis and Treatment It can be hard to diagnose tularemia because the symptoms can be similar to other diseases. Your doctor will test you to confirm the bacteria is present. They may also order a chest X-ray to check for signs of pneumonia . Treatment usually involves antibiotics , either injected or by mouth . If you have complications like pneumonia or meningitis , you’ll also need treatment for these conditions. Usually people who have had tularemia become immune to it, but some people get it more than once.', 'Prevention You can protect yourself by: Not using bare hands to skin or dress wild animals Avoiding sick or dead animals Wearing clothing that covers exposed skin (tight at the wrists and ankles ) Using insect repellents Removing ticks promptly Drinking clean water Fully cooking wild meats']"
9,Huntington's Disease,"[""What is Huntington's Disease? Huntington's disease (HD) is a hereditary and deadly disorder that causes nerve cells in the brain to break down. This causes physical and mental abilities to weaken, and they get worse over time. There is no cure. If it starts early in life, it’s called juvenile Huntington’s disease. A diagnosis of Huntington's disease may come as quite a shock. There's a lot to take in. But tapping into a support system, such as a social worker, therapist, or support group, can make the journey a bit less daunting. With the help of a healthcare team, people with Huntington's can live independently for many years."", ""Symptoms of Huntington's Disease Although symptoms may first show up in midlife, Huntington's can strike anyone from childhood to advanced age. Symptoms often first appear when people are in their 30s or 40s. Over 10 to 25 years, the disease gradually kills nerve cells in the brain . This affects the body, mind, and emotions. If symptoms begin before age 20, it’s called juvenile Huntington’s Disease and it may get worse faster."", ""Symptoms can vary greatly from person to person. And stress or excitement can worsen symptoms. Some symptoms are easier to spot than others. Abnormal movements may be the first thing you notice. Weight loss can be a concern at all stages. Symptoms of Huntington's disease tend to develop in stages. Early stage symptoms Changes may be quite subtle in the early stages, making it possible to keep driving and working. You may just require a little extra help. Common early symptoms include: Trouble learning new things Trouble making decisions Memory lapses Mood swings Clumsiness Slow or abnormal eye movements Muscle problems (dystonia) Trouble sleeping (insomnia) Loss of energy and fatigue Middle stage symptoms With time, symptoms begin to interfere more with your day-to-day life. For example, you might start to drop things or to fall. Or you may have trouble speaking or swallowing. Staying organized may be difficult. And emotional changes may put pressure on relationships . Common middle stage symptoms include: Uncontrolled twitching movements (chorea) Trouble walking Confusion Memory loss Personality changes Speech changes Decline in thinking abilities Swallowing problems Breathing problems Thoughts of death, dying, or suicide Weight loss Development of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), bipolar disorder, or mania"", ""Late stage symptoms In this stage, people with Huntington's must depend on others for their care. Walking and speaking are not possible Most likely you will still be aware of loved ones around you. Fidgety movements may become severe or may subside. Juvenile Huntington’s disease symptoms In children or teens , Huntington's may progress more quickly and cause symptoms like: Stiff or awkward walking Increased clumsiness Changes in speech Trouble paying attention Sudden drop in school performance Behavior problems Tremors Seizures"", ""Diagnosing Huntington's Disease Family history plays a major role in a diagnosis. Your doctor will ask you questions about your medical background and give you a physical exam. If you and your doctor suspect Huntington’s disease, a neurologist will conduct more tests. A neurologist may test: Reflexes Muscle strength Balance Sense of touch Vision Hearing Mood and mental status Memory Reasoning Thinking skills Speech"", ""Treatment and Home Remedies for Huntington's Disease For now, treating Huntington's involves managing symptoms: Medications can help control fidgety movements. Your doctor can work closely with you to manage any side effects and to change medications if needed. Some antipsychotic drugs have a side effect that controls movement and have been helpful for some people. Antidepressants can also help with obsessive-compulsive disorder. Mood-stabilizing drugs can ease symptoms of mood disorders but may cause other side effects. Speech or language therapy may be helpful for any problems with speech or swallowing. Occupational or physical therapy may help you learn how to better control movements. And assistive devices such as handrails can help you manage your changing physical abilities. Nutritional support ranges from using special utensils to focusing on nutrient-dense foods to supplementing with tube feeding in later stages. Exercise may be very helpful. People with Huntington's who stay as fit and active as they can seem to do better than those who do not. Psychotherapy can teach you ways to manage changes in your emotions and how you think.\xa0 Strategies like breaking tasks into simpler steps may go a long way toward making these changes a bit easier for you and your family. Family members can help by making some changes at home: Serve extra meals and add high-calorie supplements to help you stay at a healthy weight. Limit distractions during meal times. Choose foods that are easier to chew and swallow. Use forks and other utensils made for people with limited motor skills. Use covered cups with straws or drinking spouts. Keep a regular routine. Use phone or computer reminders for tasks. Keep life as calm, simple, and low-stress as possible. For children, work with the school counselor to make an education plan. See friends and maintain social interactions as much as possible. Add wheelchair ramps and elevators to the home if possible. Add safety bars in bathrooms, next to the bed, and on stairs. Use voice-controlled lights and other “smart” home features. Use electronic speech programs or picture charts to aid communication."", ""Causes of Huntington's Disease In 1993, researchers found the gene that causes Huntington's. Everyone has the HD gene, but in some families an abnormal copy of the gene gets passed from parent to child. If you have a parent with Huntington's disease, you have a 50% chance of having the gene and developing the disease. Also: Men and women are equally likely to inherit the abnormal gene. If you don't have the abnormal gene, you can't get Huntington's or pass it on to your children. The disease doesn't skip generations. If you or members of your family plan to be tested for Huntington's, it's a good idea to get professional genetic counseling first. Counselors can help explain what to expect from the test results. With knowledge about the HD gene, scientists have been able to learn a great deal about how the disease affects the brain . More importantly, this discovery may help pave the way for future treatment.""]"
10,What Is Degenerative Disk Disease?,"[""What Is Degenerative Disk Disease? Degenerative disk disease is when normal changes that take place in the disks of your spine cause pain. Despite its name, this condition isn't actually a disease. Degenerative disk is a condition caused over time by injuries, sports, daily activities, or if a spinal disk dries out and shrinks. What are spinal disks? Spinal disks are like shock absorbers between the vertebrae, or bones, of your spine . They help your back stay flexible so you can bend and twist. As you get older, they can show signs of wear and tear. They begin to break down and may not work as well. Nearly everyone's disks break down over time, but not everyone feels pain. If worn-out spinal disks are the reason you're hurting, you have degenerative disk disease."", 'Types of Degenerative Disk Disease Disk degeneration typically develops in the parts of your spine that move the most: your lower back or your neck. Lumbar degenerative disk disease Your lower back, or lumbar spine, has five vertebrae, which are the largest bones in your back. Doctors refer to them as L1 to L5. Spinal disks separate each of these vertebrae. About 90% of disk problems caused by degenerative disk disease happen in the lowest portions of your lumbar spine.', 'Cervical degenerative disk disease This happens in your neck, or cervical spine. Seven vertebrae make up your cervical spine. They are each separated by a spinal disk. Your cervical spine supports all sorts of movements, such as turning your head from side to side and looking up and down. Disk degeneration in this area can make those movements painful and difficult, though many people have no symptoms. Degenerative disk disease can result from sports, injuries, daily activities, or aging. (Photo credit: E+/Getty Images)', ""Degenerative Disk Disease Causes Your spinal disks are made up of a soft inner core and a tough outer wall. The disks change in ways that may cause degenerative disk disease, such as by: Drying out. When you're born, the disks in your spine are mostly made up of water. As you age, they lose water and get thinner. Flatter disks can't absorb shocks as well. The water loss also means less cushion or padding between your vertebrae. This can lead to other problems in your spine that may cause pain . Cracking. Stress and strain on your back can cause tiny tears in the outer wall of your disks, which contain nerves. Any tears near the nerves can become painful. And if the wall breaks down, the disk's soft core may push through the cracks. The disk may bulge, or it may slip out of place, which is called a slipped or herniated disk. It can affect nearby nerves. Such tears can be caused by: Daily activities. Wear and tear on your back from the things you do every day, like lifting a heavy laundry basket, picking up a crying child, and working in the garden, can contribute to disk degeneration over time. Injuries. Even minor injuries to your back -- from a fall, for example, or lifting something heavy incorrectly -- make disk degeneration more likely. You may not feel pain at the time of the injury, but their impacts add up over time."", 'Degenerative Disk Disease Risk Factors A number of things boost your risk of disk degeneration. Some of them can be avoided, while others can’t be. Aging. This is the big one. As you get older, your disks begin to degenerate. Some experts estimate that about 9 out of 10 people will show signs of disk degeneration by age 60. But that’s considered normal, and it does not always cause pain or other symptoms. If you do have symptoms, you likely have degenerative disk disease. Obesity. Several studies have linked being overweight to spinal damage, including degenerative disk disease. Excess weight puts stress on all parts of your spine. If you have obesity and carry the bulk of your weight in your middle, your risk of degenerative disk disease may be particularly high. Heavy lifting and manual labor. Some research suggests that jobs in which you have to do a lot of heavy lifting may modestly bump up your risk of disk degeneration. Family history. Did one or both of your parents have degenerative disk disease? If so, you may be at higher risk because it can run in families. Scientists have identified many genes that may increase your risk. Smoking. Need another reason to quit? Several studies have reported that smoking ups your odds of degenerative disk disease. But that’s not all. If you already have degenerative disk disease, smoking may make it worse. You may feel more pain. If you need surgery, smoking may make you more likely to have complications.', ""Degenerative Disk Disease Symptoms You'll probably feel a sharp or constant pain in your back and neck. Your exact symptoms will depend on where the weak disk is and other changes it has caused. Common signs include pain that: Feels worse when you sit and better when you move and walk Feels worse when you bend, lift, or twist Gets better when you change positions or lie down In some cases, degenerative disk disease can lead to numbness and tingling in your arms and legs. It can also cause your leg muscles to become weak. This means the damaged disks may be affecting the nerves near your spine."", 'The pain, which can be severe, may not be constant. This is because the bone around the injured disk has become unstable. This instability can cause pain that lingers as briefly as a few days or sticks around as long as a few months. The pain that you feel may range from mild to disabling. The pain starts in the area of your spine where the disk degeneration happens. Lumbar disk degeneration leads to pain in your lower back, while cervical disk degeneration causes pain in the neck. But that pain and discomfort is not always limited to those areas. A degenerated disk can pinch, or compress, the nerves in your spine. If that happens, pain can travel to other parts of your body. A pinched nerve in your lower back can cause pain in your buttocks and thighs, while a pinched nerve in your neck may cause pain in your arms and hands.', ""Degenerative Disk Disease Diagnosis Your doctor will talk to you about your medical history and your symptoms. They may ask you: When the pain started Which part of your spine hurts If it has spread to other parts of your body If you've had past spine injuries If you have a family history of similar problems They'll look at your spine for signs of the condition, like pain in your lower back or neck. They may also ask you to walk or bend to see which movements cause pain. Your doctor may order an X-ray or MRI to check for bone or nerve damage near your spine."", 'Degenerative Disk Disease Treatment The goal is to ease pain and stop more damage. Your doctor will suggest the best plan for you, based on your symptoms and how serious your condition is. Treatment may include: Medication . Over-the-counter pain relievers like aspirin and ibuprofen can help fight inflammation . They can ease your pain and lessen swelling. Your doctor may prescribe a stronger drug for pain if you need it. Degenerative disk disease may also lead to muscle spasms . Your doctor may suggest medicine to help relieve them. Physical therapy. Specific movements make the muscles in your neck and back stronger and more flexible. This supports the spine. In most cases, physical therapy and pain medication are enough for long-term relief. Steroid shots. These have strong medications to ease pain, swelling, and inflammation . Your doctor may suggest you get a shot in the epidural space in your back, a fluid-filled area around the spinal cord, or get one in your nerve or muscle. Radiofrequency neurotomy. In this procedure, your doctor will use radio waves to heat and destroy nerve tissues in your spine. This prevents the nerve from sending pain signals to your brain. You may feel immediate pain relief, though it could take up to 3 weeks for the benefits to fully kick in. That pain relief typically lasts 6 months to a year, though it can continue for several years. Unfortunately, some people do not benefit as much as others from this procedure.', ""Dealing with degenerative disk disease pain Medical treatments are not the only way to manage your pain. Here are some other things that you should try: Slim down. Excess weight strains your back and raises your odds of nerve damage and pain. Losing weight can help prevent or ease your discomfort. Get a massage. Some research suggests that massages can offer temporary lower back pain relief. Massage may be included in your physical therapy plan. Try TENS. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, or TENS, is a treatment that delivers small electrical impulses to your body to help ease pain. The treatment shouldn't feel painful, but more like a tingling sensation. You can buy a TENS device over-the-counter and use it at home. Ask your doctor to help you pick out the right TENS device for you and to show you how to use it. Correct your posture. By sitting and standing with a proper posture, you keep your spine in alignment and ease its workload. That can help prevent back pain. Your physical therapist may give you exercises to improve your posture. Exercise regularly. Lots of different types of exercise can help ease your back pain. These include yoga, tai chi, Pilates, and stretching. Talk to your doctor before you begin a new exercise program. Try hot and cold therapy. Apply a heating pad for 10 to 15 minutes to your back, then swap it out for a cold pack for another 10 to 15 minutes. Do this three to four times daily to ease pain and inflammation."", ""Degenerative Disk Disease Surgery If other treatments don't work, your doctor may recommend surgery. There are several options to consider, including: Spinal fusion. In this procedure, the damaged disk is removed and replaced by bone that connects to the bones above and below where the disk used to be. This eases pain and helps your back work better. Diskectomy. Part of the degenerated disk is removed. This relieves pressure on the nerves, easing pain, numbness, and weakness. Foraminotomy, laminotomy, and laminectomy. During these procedures, the surgeon removes a portion of bone in your back in order to reach the problem disk and cut out the damaged portion to relieve pressure on the nerves. You may undergo a combination of these procedures. Artificial disk replacement. Your surgeon will remove the disk that’s causing your pain and replace it with a disk made of metal or metal and plastic."", 'Things to Avoid With Degenerative Disk Disease You can help your back by avoiding the following: Smoking. As mentioned earlier, smoking can worsen your pain. It also can make treatment for degenerative disk disease less effective.', 'Heavy lifting. Lifting heavy weights puts strains and stresses the disks in your back, especially when done frequently, such as for work. Overdoing it with alcohol. Excessive drinking raises your risk of back pain. Sitting for long periods. Your back will feel better when walking rather than spending too much time at your desk or on your couch. High impact exercise. Exercises and sports that involve running, jumping, twisting, and other high-impact movements -- think football, weightlifting, tennis -- can be hard on your back. Try low impact exercises like walking and swimming instead.', 'Degenerative Disk Disease Prevention While you can’t stop getting older -- the No. 1 risk factor for degenerative disk disease -- you can make some changes that may help prevent or slow the damage to your spinal disks: Maintain a healthy weight. Quit smoking, or don’t start. Get regular exercise to keep your back strong and flexible. But always talk to your doctor before beginning a new exercise program.', 'Takeaways Degenerative disk disease is a condition where your spinal disks break down with age and daily activity. Regular, low-impact exercise like swimming or yoga can help prevent the onset or slow the progression of the condition. While there are many nonsurgical and at-home treatments you can take to manage your pain, surgery may be necessary for long-term relief. Talk with your doctor to figure out the best treatment plan for you.', 'Degenerative Disk Disease FAQs How serious is degenerative disk disease? Disks degenerate as you age. It’s a natural part of getting older, and you may not develop symptoms. But the degeneration can cause severe, even disabling pain. See your doctor if you develop any of the symptoms mentioned above. What can be done for degenerative disk disease? Lifestyle changes, such as weight loss and exercise, can ease your symptoms. Ibuprofen, aspirin, and other over-the-counter pain relievers also can help, as can steroid anesthetic shots. Your doctors have other treatments, including surgery, in their toolbox. What triggers degenerative disk disease? Lots of things up your odds of degenerative disk disease, but older age is the main risk factor. Most people over 60 show some signs of disk degeneration. Back injuries, even minor ones, and activities that put strain on your back can add up over time and contribute to degenerative disk disease. So can obesity. And, finally, if it runs in your family, degenerative disk disease may be in your future. What are the four stages of degenerative disk disease? Dysfunction. The disks have begun to degenerate, and you may develop mild to moderate pain. Dehydration. At this stage, your spinal disks begin to dry out.

11,"Dehydration: Signs, Symptoms, and Effects","[""What Is Dehydration? Dehydration happens when your body doesn't have as much fluid as it needs. That means your body can't function properly. Common causes include sweating, diarrhea, and vomiting. You can have mild, moderate, or severe dehydration . If you are an adult, the seriousness of your dehydration depends on how much fluid your body is missing. I n children, dehydration is based on how much body weight they've lost due to a lack of fluids. Mild dehydration: This causes symptoms such as thirst, less peeing and sweating, and dry mouth. Children have mild dehydration when they lose 3%-5% of their body weight due to fluid loss. You can treat mild dehydration at home by drinking water, electrolyte drinks, or oral rehydration solutions you can buy at the drugstore. Moderate dehydration : The symptoms are similar to those of moderate dehydration but are more intense. In children, it means they've lost\xa06%-10% of their body weight. You'll need a medical professional to give you fluids through an IV. Severe dehydration : Symptoms include dizziness, sunken eyes, fainting, rapid breathing, and a racing heart. Children may lose over 10% of their body weight. This type of dehydration requires immediate medical attention. You may be treated with IV fluids containing salt."", 'Causes of Dehydration It’s normal to lose water from your body every day by sweating , breathing, peeing, pooping, and through tears and saliva (spit). Usually, you replace the lost liquid by drinking fluids and eating foods that contain water. If you lose too much water or don’t drink and eat enough, you can get dehydrated. You can lose more water than usual with: A fever Diarrhea Vomiting Excessive sweating Peeing a lot (d iabetes and some medications such as water pills , also called diuretics, can make you pee more often) You may not replace the water you lose because: You’re busy and forget to drink enough.

If they can’t get around very well anymore, they may not be able to get a drink easily or may not be able to take in enough fluids due to medical conditions. People who are ill with a cold or sore throat may not want to eat or drink. People with a chronic disease such as type 1 or type 2 diabetes can pee a lot if the disease is uncontrolled. They also may take medicines such as water pills, which make them go more often.

12,Dermatitis Herpetiformis: How Do I Get Rid of It?,"[""What Is Dermatitis Herpetiformis? Dermatitis herpetiformis is a bumpy,\xa0very itchy skin\xa0rash\xa0that’s caused by gluten sensitivity. In fact, about 10%-25% of people with celiac disease get dermatitis herpetiformis. Celiac disease is an\xa0autoimmune disorder\xa0that keeps your body from digesting\xa0gluten, a protein found in wheat, rye, and barley. An autoimmune condition is when your immune system mistakes your own tissues for foreign invaders and attacks them. Dermatitis herpetiformis is a very itchy rash that often shows up on the scalp. (Photo credit: iStock/Getty Images) It's possible to get dermatitis herpetiformis without celiac disease, but it's rare. This skin condition, also known as Duhring’s disease, causes\xa0blisters and a rash\xa0that looks like\xa0herpes, b ut it's not caused by the virus that causes herpes. So, it's not contagious. You only get it when your body is sensitive to gluten. Doctors will be able to tell if your rash is caused by gluten by testing your blood and skin for antibodies ( proteins made by your immune system to protect you from foreign invaders) to gluten. Doctors don't yet know of any ways to prevent you from getting it, but you can reduce your chance of a flare-up if you eat a gluten-free diet."", 'Dermatitis Herpetiformis Causes and Risk Factors The causes of dermatitis herpetiformis include: Your genes. If you have certain gene types that make it hard for your body to tell your own tissues from foreign invaders, then you are more likely to get dermatitis herpetiformis. These gene types are called HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8, and many people who have autoimmune conditions have these gene types. So, y ou’re more likely to get celiac disease, gluten-sensitive enteropathy (ongoing damage in your small intestine due to gluten), or dermatitis herpetiformis if one of your parents or a brother or sister has any of these conditions too. Gluten in your food. When you have celiac disease or gluten-sensitive enteropathy (GSE) and eat\xa0foods with gluten, your\xa0intestines make an antibody called immunoglobulin A (IgA) in response. This protein flows into your bloodstream and builds up in\xa0the blood vessels under your\xa0skin, which triggers the dermatitis herpetiformis rash . Although anyone can get dermatitis herpetiformis, you may be more likely to get it if you:', ""Are of northern European descent. Dermatitis herpetiformis is rare in people of African or Asian descent. Have celiac disease or have a close relative who has dermatitis herpetiformis or celiac disease. Have a history of autoimmune conditions in your family, especially the following: Anemia Thyroid disease Type 1 diabetes Alopecia areata (a condition where you lose hair in patches, usually from your scalp) Addison's disease (a condition where your adrenal glands don't make enough of the hormones aldosterone and cortisol) Are assigned male at birth (AMAB). About twice as many people who are AMAB have dermatitis herpetiformis as people who are assigned female at birth (AFAB). Are between 30 and 40 years old. It's rare in children and older people. Dermatitis herpetiformis in childhood Dermatitis herpetiformis rarely shows up before puberty. When it's diagnosed in kids, it's usually when they are 2-7 years old. Also, it seems to be more common in kids who are AFAB than kids who are AMAB. The signs and symptoms of dermatitis herpetiformis are similar in adults and kids. However, in some cases, children also get rashes on their palms, face, and soles of their feet. Sometimes, they also have lumps deep under their skin."", ""Dermatitis Herpetiformis Symptoms Your symptoms may include: A skin rash with bumps and extremely itchy blisters (this is the most common symptom). The rash of dermatitis herpetiformis is usually a cluster of bumps on a patch of skin that has changed color from your usual skin tone. The bumps may be darker than your usual skin tone. If you have a light skin tone, they may look red or purple. You may also get blisters (fluid-filled bumps) that burn. The rash is so itchy that some people scratch their blisters off. These rashes usually show up on your elbows, knees, butt, and scalp, although some people may also get rashes on their chest, stomach, and back. They usually show up on both sides of your body (for instance, both elbows or both butt cheeks) at the same time. When they heal, they don't usually leave a scar. Changes in the way your teeth look. Some people may see pits, color changes, or grooves in their teeth. Also, some people get canker sores (small, painful sores on the inside of your cheeks or lips, under your tongue, or on your gums). Digestive symptoms of celiac disease. These include stomach pain, bloating, cramping, and diarrhea or constipation."", ""Dermatitis Herpetiformis vs. Eczema The rash of dermatitis herpetiformis can look like a few different skin conditions, such as: Herpes, a common sexually transmitted disease (STD) that can cause blisters and ulcers around your mouth and on your genitals. Scabies, a skin condition from little bugs that burrow into your skin. This causes small bumps that are very itchy, often in the folds of skin between your fingers and toes. Hives, an itchy skin rash usually caused by an allergic reaction . Eczema, a long-term condition where the outer skin layer is damaged, which makes it hard for your skin to keep its regular moisture level. Eczema is very common, so it's the condition most often confused with dermatitis herpetiformis. Like dermatitis herpetiformis, eczema can lead to an intensely itchy rash and possibly bumps on your elbows and legs (especially behind your knees). But, unlike dermatitis herpetiformis, eczema also causes dry, flaky, and sometimes thickened patches of skin. Also, after your rash heals, the skin may be either lighter or darker than your usual skin tone for several months, especially if your natural skin tone is dark. Dermatitis herpetiformis usually heals without scars or other skin changes. People with eczema can usually find relief from their itchy, dry skin with a good skincare routine, such as using soap-free cleansers and moisturizers. But these topical treatments won't help people with dermatitis herpetiformis."", ""Dermatitis Herpetiformis Diagnosis Your doctor may suspect dermatitis herpetiformis from your symptoms, especially the way your rash looks. However, to make sure, they will likely run a few tests, including: Blood tests to look for antibodies that are common in people with celiac disease . These antibodies are called anti-endomysial antibody (EMA), anti-deamidated synthetic gliadin-derived peptide (DGP), and anti-tissue transglutaminase (tTG). If you test positive for these antibodies, then it's very likely that you have celiac disease, and a key part of your treatment will be to avoid gluten . A skin biopsy to look for an antibody called immunoglobulin A (IgA) in and around the skin of your rash. Rarely, an intestinal biopsy to look for damage in your small intestine. Your doctor doesn't usually need to do this to diagnose dermatitis herpetiformis because they can diagnose it from your symptoms and the results of your blood test and skin biopsy. But, if the results from your blood tests and skin biopsies don't match up, your doctor may want to do an intestinal biopsy to be sure."", ""Dermatitis Herpetiformis Treatment and Home Remedies Your doctor will likely treat you in a couple of different ways: 1. Suggest a strict gluten-free diet. This will eventually clear up your skin and thus reduce your need to take medicine for the itch. It has other benefits, too. Most people who have dermatitis herpetiformis also have the autoimmune condition celiac disease. If you have one autoimmune condition, you have a higher risk of getting another. Some autoimmune conditions you may have a higher risk of getting include: Thyroid disorders (like Hashimoto's thyroiditis or Graves' disease) Pernicious anemia (a condition where your body can't absorb vitamin B12) Type 1 diabetes (when your body stops making insulin) But if you have celiac disease, you can help lower your risk of getting other autoimmune conditions by following a gluten-free diet. A gluten-free diet will also prevent the damage that gluten can cause to your intestines when you are sensitive to it. This will improve your ability to absorb the nutrients from your food and lower your risk of getting intestinal lymphoma, a type of cancer that people with celiac disease are at high risk of getting."", ""Following a strict gluten-free diet is the only at-home treatment that will work for dermatitis herpetiformis. However, it may take several months on a gluten-free diet for your skin to clear up. So, your doctor will likely also prescribe medicine to help you until then. 2. Prescribe dermatitis herpetiformis medications . Medications\xa0can help soothe your rash, but there's no cure for it. Your doctor might prescribe\xa0dapsone, an antibiotic, which you take by\xa0mouth. It usually gets rid of your\xa0itching\xa0and bumps within 1-3 days. You will have regular blood tests while you're taking dapsone, especially at first. Some people have a serious reaction to dapsone. You're more likely to have a reaction if you have glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. G6PD deficiency is a genetic condition where your body doesn't make enough of an enzyme that keeps your red blood cells from breaking down. So, your doctor may test your G6PD activity before they prescribe dapsone. If you have G6PD deficiency, they may prescribe a medicine called cimetidine, which can help prevent a reaction to dapsone."", ""Your doctor may also recommend a steroid cream for your skin, such as betamethasone or clobetasol, to help with itching. Some people need to take dapsone for 1-2 years to keep their skin clear, but many people can stop using dapsone if they stay on a strict gluten-free diet . If dapsone doesn't work for you or if you can't take it because you had a serious reaction, your doctor may prescribe you sulfa drugs, such as sulfamethoxypyridazine, sulfapyridine, or sulfasalazine. If those don't work, your doctor may try immunosuppressant drugs, such as: Colchicine Cyclosporine A or azathioprine Heparin Mycophenolate Nicotinamide Rituximab Tetracycline No matter the medicine your doctor prescribes, you still need to avoid all sources of gluten. If you're strictly gluten-free and you have flare-ups of your dermatitis herpetiformis, you may want to see a gastroenterologist (a specialist in the stomach and intestines) with expertise in celiac disease. One cause could be a high iodine intake. Iodine is a mineral your body needs for your thyroid to function. Your thyroid controls your ability to metabolize food. You get iodine from seafood, dairy, grains, eggs, and iodized salt. Some doctors have reported that eating foods with lots of iodine can worsen your dermatitis herpetiformis symptoms. Because iodine is something your body needs, you shouldn't try to cut iodine out of your diet. This is why you may want to see a specialist who can help you figure out what's causing your flare-ups."", 'Living With Dermatitis Herpetiformis It can be challenging to adapt to a gluten-free diet. But avoiding gluten will improve the rashes that can make it hard for you to focus during the day or sleep at night. When you live gluten-free, you may also be able to stop taking medicine. Some people also go into remission, which is when your symptoms go away completely for a while. You may need to see several specialists to help you manage your condition. For instance, a gastroenterologist can help with your digestive issues, and a dermatologist can help solve your skin issues. You may also want to see a dietitian, who can help you find sources of gluten in your favorite foods and then search out alternatives.', ""Here are some dermatitis herpetiformis self-care tips that experts recommend to help you get started on your gluten-free life: Focus on eating whole foods without gluten that you love. This could include vegetables, fruits, poultry, meat, fish, eggs, dairy, beans, nuts, and seeds. You can also eat grains that don't have gluten, such as quinoa, rice, and corn. Watch out for processed foods because these often have additives, flavors, and other ingredients that may make them unsafe for you to eat."", ""Make a list of all the foods with gluten you think you'll miss. You can often find specialty gluten-free foods to replace these. Many people follow a gluten-free diet these days, so there are plenty of products and recipes available to help you find new gluten-free favorites. If you're having trouble here, a dietician will probably have some helpful ideas and resources. Take care when you eat out. Many restaurants will advertise that they have gluten-free options, but you want to make sure there's no cross-contamination with their regular menu items. Call restaurants ahead of time and tell them that you have celiac disease. Confirm that they have truly gluten-free options available on their menu because if you eat it, you'll get very sick. Until you find a reliable set of restaurants, you may need to cut down on how often you eat out . Take your diet overhaul in steps. It's unreasonable to think that you'll completely change your diet overnight. Make steady steps to remove gluten from your diet and take time to adjust to your new way of eating. Dermatitis herpetiformis can be uncomfortable, but it's not dangerous. You have time to find what works for you in your life. Eventually, you will adjust so that you can live your best gluten-free life and kiss those itchy rashes goodbye.""]"

Around 100 million Americans have type 1 or type 2 diabetes .', 'Symptoms of Diabetes Insipidus Symptoms include: Severe thirst Peeing more than 3 liters a day (your doctor might call this polyuria ) Getting up to go a lot at night Peeing during sleep (bed-wetting) Pale, colorless urine Low measured concentration of urine Preference for cold drinks Dehydration Weakness Muscle pains Crankiness With dehydration, you might notice: Extreme thirst: often drinking more than 1 gallon of liquid per day Fatigue Feeling sluggish Dizziness Confusion Nausea Loss of consciousness', 'Symptoms in Infants and Children Many of the symptoms are similar in younger people. In infants, watch for: Crankiness Slow growth Poor feeding Weight loss Fever Vomiting In children, signs include: Drinking a lot of water Peeing often, sometimes every hour New bed-wetting or waking during the night to pee Dehydration Low energy', 'Diabetes Insipidus Causes Your body makes a hormone called vasopressin in a part of your brain called the hypothalamus . It’s stored in your pituitary gland. Vasopressin tells your kidneys to hold on to water , which makes your urine more concentrated. (Vasopressin is also called antidiuretic hormone or ADH.) When you’re thirsty or a little dehydrated, your vasopressin levels go up. Your kidneys absorb more water and put out concentrated urine. If you’ve had enough to drink, vasopressin levels fall, and what comes out is clear and diluted.', ""When your body doesn’t make enough vasopressin, the condition is called central diabetes insipidus . Anyone can get central DI, but it's not common. Only about 1 in every 25,000 people gets it. If you make enough but your kidneys don’t respond to it the way they should, you have nephrogenic diabetes insipidus . In either form, the result is the same. Your kidneys can't keep water, so even if you’re dehydrated, they'll put out a lot of pale urine."", 'Diabetes Insipidus Risk Factors Changes in the genes that you inherit from your parents can make you more likely to get diabetes insipidus. This happens in 1% to 2% of cases.', 'Types of Diabetes Insipidus Central diabetes insipidus. You get this when damage to your hypothalamus or pituitary gland affects how your body makes or puts out vasopressin. Your kidneys remove too much fluid from your body, and you pee more. This damage can result from: A tumor A head injury A blocked or bulging artery (aneurysm) Diseases such as Langerhans cell histiocytosis Infection Inflammation Surgery Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. You get this when your kidneys don’t respond to vasopressin and take too much fluid from your bloodstream. Doctors don’t always know why it happens, but some causes include: A blocked urinary tract Chronic kidney disease High levels of calcium in your blood Low levels of potassium in your blood Some medications, like lithium Gestational diabetes insipidus. This is very rare. You get this type only during pregnancy. Sometimes, a woman’s placenta -- the organ that gives oxygen and nutrients to your baby -- makes an enzyme that breaks down vasopressin. Other pregnant women make more prostaglandin, a hormone-like chemical that makes their kidneys less sensitive to vasopressin. Most cases of gestational diabetes insipidus are mild and don’t cause clear symptoms. The condition usually goes away after birth, but it might come back in another pregnancy .', 'How Is Diabetes Insipidus Diagnosed? Your doctor will do a physical exam . A checkup may not show any signs of central DI, except maybe an enlarged bladder or symptoms of dehydration . They’ll ask questions about your health history, including your family’s health. You might get a series of tests that include: Urinalysis. You’ll give a sample of your pee, and your doctor will send it to a lab to see whether it’s dilute or concentrated. They can also check for glucose, which can help them decide if you have diabetes insipidus or diabetes mellitus. You might need to collect your pee over a 24-hour period to see how much you’re putting out. Blood test. This will measure the electrolytes and glucose in your blood. This lets your doctor know if you have diabetes mellitus or diabetes insipidus. It may help them figure out which type. Fluid deprivation test . This measures the changes in your body weight , blood sodium, and urine concentration after you don’t drink anything for a while. There are two types: Short-form fluid deprivation test. You stop drinking for a short time. You collect a sample and take it back to your doctor, who sends it to a lab. Formal fluid deprivation test. You’ll have this done in a hospital so doctors can make sure you don’t get dehydrated. You’ll be weighed and give a sample every hour or two until: Your blood pressure drops too low or you have a rapid heartbeat when you stand You lose 5% or more of your starting body weight Your urine concentration goes up a little bit over two or three measurements MRI. This test takes detailed pictures of your internal organs and soft tissues. The doctor uses it to see if there’s a problem with your hypothalamus or pituitary gland. Genetic screening. Your doctor may suggest this test if your family members have had problems with making too much urine.', 'Complications of Diabetes Insipidus Diabetes insipidus that isn’t under control can make you more likely to have complications like: Dehydration. Diabetes insipidus makes it hard for your body to hold on to water. It’s easy to get dehydrated. Electrolyte imbalance. Electrolytes are minerals in your body with a tiny electric charge. When you lose too much water, your electrolyte levels can be abnormal. This might cause: A headache Feeling tired all the time ( fatigue ) Irritability Muscle pain Less sleep. Diabetes insipidus can lead to nocturia , a medical name for waking up in the night to pee. The result: a less restful night.', 'Diabetes Insipidus Treatment First, your doctor will tell you to drink plenty of fluids. That will replace the constant loss of water. Other treatments depend on which type you have: Central diabetes insipidus. You’ll take medications like desmopressin ( DDAVP ).\xa0Desmopressin controls urine output, maintains fluid balance, and prevents dehydration. You take it two or three times a day. It usually comes as a nasal spray, tablets, or injections. There are also treatments to help these drugs work better. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus can be harder to treat. If it’s caused by a drug, stopping the medicine helps. Other medicines may ease symptoms. These include indomethacin ( Indocin ) and diuretics like amiloride ( Moduretic 5-50 ) or hydrochlorothiazide ( Microzide ). Though diuretics typically make you pee more, in this case, they help you make less urine. Sometimes, this condition goes away if you treat the cause. Gestational diabetes insipidus. You can take desmopressin while you’re pregnant. Your problems should go away after you have the baby .', 'Diabetes Insipidus Outlook Diabetes insipidus doesn’t cause kidney failure or lead to dialysis . Your kidneys still do their main job, which is to filter your blood. But you will be more prone to dehydration. Make sure you always have something to drink close by, especially when it’s hot or when you exercise .\xa0Carry your medication with you, and avoid situations where you can\'t get water. It\'s also a good idea to wear ""medic alert"" jewelry, or keep a note with you about your condition, so that health care workers know about it.']"
16,Type 1 Diabetes,"['What Is Type 1 Diabetes? Type 1 diabetes is a condition in which your immune system destroys insulin -making cells in your pancreas . These are called beta cells. The condition is usually diagnosed in children and young people , so it used to be called juvenile diabetes. A condition called secondary diabetes is like type 1 , but your beta cells are wiped out by something else, like a disease or an injury to your pancreas, rather than by your immune system. Both of these are different from type 2 diabetes , in which your body doesn’t respond to insulin the way it should.', 'Type 1 Diabetes Symptoms Signs are often subtle, but they can become severe. They include: Extreme thirst Increased hunger (especially after eating) Dry mouth Upset stomach and vomiting Frequent urination Unexplained weight loss, even though you’re eating and feel hungry Fatigue Blurry vision Heavy, labored breathing (your doctor may call this Kussmaul respiration) Frequent infections of your skin , urinary tract, or vagina Crankiness or mood changes Bedwetting in a child who’s been dry at night Signs of an emergency with type 1 diabetes include: Shaking and confusion Rapid breathing Fruity smell to your breath Belly pain Loss of consciousness (rare)', ""Type 1 Diabetes Causes Insulin is a hormone that helps move sugar, or glucose, into your body's tissues. Your cells use it as fuel. Damage to beta cells from type 1 diabetes throws the process off. Glucose doesn’t move into your cells because insulin isn’t there to do the job. Instead, it builds up in your blood , and your cells starve. This causes high blood sugar , which can lead to: Dehydration . When there’s extra sugar in your blood, you pee more. That’s your body’s way of getting rid of it. A large amount of water goes out with that urine , causing your body to dry out. Weight loss. The glucose that goes out when you pee takes calories with it. That’s why many people with high blood sugar lose weight. Dehydration also plays a part. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). If your body can't get enough glucose for fuel, it breaks down fat cells instead. This creates chemicals called ketones. Your liver releases the sugar it stores to help out. But your body can’t use it without insulin, so it builds up in your blood, along with the acidic ketones. This mix of extra glucose, dehydration, and acid buildup is known as ketoacidosis and can be life-threatening if not treated right away. Damage to your body. Over time, high glucose levels in your blood can harm the nerves and small blood vessels in your eyes , kidneys , and heart . They can also make you more likely to get hardened arteries , or atherosclerosis , which can lead to heart attacks and strokes."", ""There’s no way to prevent type 1 diabetes. Doctors don't know all the things that cause it. But they know that your genes play a role. They also know that you can get type 1 diabetes when something around you, like a virus, tells your immune system to go after your pancreas . Most people with type 1 diabetes have signs of this attack, called autoantibodies. They’re there in almost everyone who has the condition when their blood sugar is high. Type 1 diabetes can happen along with other autoimmune diseases , like Graves’ disease or vitiligo."", 'Type 1 Diabetes Risk Factors Only about 5% of people with diabetes have type 1. It affects males and females equally.

They may test your urine for glucose or chemicals your body makes when you don’t have enough insulin.', 'Type 1 Diabetes Treatment People who have type 1 diabetes can live long, healthy lives. You’ll need to keep a close eye on your blood sugar levels . Your doctor will give you a range that the numbers should stay within. Adjust your insulin, food, and activities as necessary. Everyone with type 1 diabetes needs to use insulin shots to control their blood sugar. When your doctor talks about insulin, they’ll mention three main things: ""Onset"" is how long it takes to reach your bloodstream and begin lowering your blood sugar. ""Peak time"" is when insulin is doing the most work in terms of lowering your blood sugar. ""Duration"" is how long it keeps working after onset. Several types of insulin are available. Rapid-acting starts to work in about 15 minutes. It peaks about 1 hour after you take it and continues to work for 2 to 4 hours. Regular or short-acting gets to work in about 30 minutes. It peaks between 2 and 3 hours and keeps working for 3 to 6 hours. Intermediate-acting won’t get into your bloodstream for 2 to 4 hours after your shot. It peaks from 4 to 12 hours and works for 12 to 18 hours. Long-acting takes several hours to get into your system and lasts about 24 hours.', 'Your doctor may start you out with two injections a day of two types of insulin. Later, you might need more shots. Most insulin comes in a small glass bottle called a vial. You draw it out with a syringe that has a needle on the end and give yourself the shot. Some kinds come in a prefilled pen. Another kind is inhaled. You can also get it from a pump, a device you wear that sends it into your body through a small tube. Your doctor will help you pick the type and the delivery method that’s best for you.', ""Lifestyle Changes Exercise is an important part of treating type 1. But it isn’t as simple as going for a run. Exercise affects your blood sugar levels. So you have to balance your insulin dose and the food you eat with any activity, even simple tasks around the house or yard. Knowledge is power. Check your blood sugar before, during, and after an activity to find out how it affects you. Some things will make your levels go up; others won't. You can lower your insulin or have a snack with carbs to keep it from dropping too low."", 'If your blood sugar is high -- above 240 mg/dL -- test for ketones, the acids that can result from high sugar levels. If they’re OK, you should be good to go. If they’re high, skip the workout . You’ll also need to understand how food affects your blood sugar. Once you know the roles that carbs, fats, and protein play, you can build a healthy eating plan that helps keep your levels where they should be. A diabetes educator or registered dietitian can help you get started.', 'Type 1 Diabetes Complications Type 1 diabetes can lead to other problems, especially if it isn’t well-controlled. Complications include: Cardiovascular disease . Diabetes can put you at higher risk of blood clots , as well as high blood pressure and cholesterol. These can lead to chest pain , heart attack, stroke , or heart failure . Skin problems . People with diabetes are more likely to get bacterial or fungal infections. Diabetes can also cause blisters or rashes . Gum disease . A lack of saliva , too much plaque, and poor blood flow can cause mouth problems. Pregnancy problems . Women with type 1 diabetes have a higher risk of early delivery, birth defects, stillbirth, and preeclampsia . Retinopathy. This eye problem happens in about 80% of adults who have had type 1 diabetes for more than 15 years. It’s rare before puberty , no matter how long you’ve had the disease. To prevent it -- and keep your eyesight -- keep good control of blood sugar, blood pressure , cholesterol , and triglycerides . Kidney damage. About 20% to 30% of people with type 1 diabetes get a condition called nephropathy. The chances go up over time. It’s most likely to show up 15 to 25 years after the onset of diabetes. It can lead to other serious problems like kidney failure and heart disease. Poor blood flow and nerve damage . Damaged nerves and hardened arteries lead to a loss of feeling in and a lack of blood supply to your feet . This raises your chances of injury and makes it harder for open sores and wounds to heal. When that happens, you could lose a limb. Nerve damage can also cause digestive problems like nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea . You can take steps to keep from getting complications. Do your best to keep your blood sugar under control. Monitor your blood pressure and cholesterol. Eat well and exercise. If you smoke, quit. Take care of your feet and teeth.

In some people, your cells don't respond to this hormone as they should (a condition called insulin resistance). Type 1 diabetes In type 1, your immune system attacks and destroys the cells in your pancreas that make insulin, leading to high blood sugar. Doctors aren't sure why this happens. Type 1 isn't related to weight or lifestyle habits. It used to be called insulin-dependent or childhood diabetes. Gestational diabetes You only get this type of diabetes when you're pregnant. It happens because hormonal changes and weight gain during pregnancy can lead to insulin resistance. It usually goes away after you have your baby."", ""Causes of Type 2 Diabetes Usually, a combination of things causes type 2 diabetes. They might include: Genes. Scientists have found different bits of DNA that affect how your body makes insulin. Weight. Having extra weight or obesity can cause insulin resistance. Metabolic syndrome. People with insulin resistance often have a group of conditions including high blood sugar, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol and triglycerides. Too much glucose from your liver. When your blood sugar is low, your liver makes and sends out glucose. After you eat, your blood sugar goes up, and your liver usually slows down and stores its glucose for later. But some people's livers don't. They keep making sugar. Bad communication between cells. Sometimes, cells send the wrong signals or don't pick up messages correctly. When these problems affect how your cells make and use insulin or glucose, this can lead to diabetes. Broken beta cells.

But if your cells ""resist"" the insulin (don\'t use it correctly), your body will make more insulin to try to help the glucose get into them. Insulin resistance can be temporary, but it can also last. T here\'s no test to detect insulin resistance , so it can be hard to diagnose.', 'Prediabetes Eventually, insulin resistance causes glucose to build up in your blood. You have prediabetes when your blood sugar levels are higher than normal, but not high enough to be considered diabetes. An A1c between 5.7% and 6.4% means you have prediabetes . You may not have any symptoms.\xa0But prediabetes ups your risk for heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes If your A1c is 6.5% or higher, you have diabetes. You may have symptoms like increased thirst, blurred vision, and numbness in feet or hands. Or you may not have any symptoms at all.', 'Type 2 diabetes with vascular complications At this stage, your diabetes has led to vascular (blood vessel) problems. You may have damage to vessels in your eyes (retinopathy), kidneys ( nephropathy ), and certain nerves (neuropathy). You might also develop heart disease, stroke, or circulation issues.', 'Type 2 Diabetes Treatment Managing type 2 diabetes includes a mix of lifestyle changes and medication. Lifestyle changes You may be able to reach your target blood sugar levels with diet and exercise alone. Weight loss. Dropping extra pounds can help. While losing 5% of your body weight is good, losing at least 7% and keeping it off seems to be ideal. That means someone who weighs 180 pounds can change their blood sugar levels by losing around 13 pounds. Weight loss can seem overwhelming, but portion control and eating healthy foods are a good place to start. Healthy eating. There’s no specific diet for type 2 diabetes. A registered dietitian can teach you about carbs and help you make a meal plan you can stick with. Focus on: Eating fewer calories Cutting back on refined carbs, especially sweets Adding veggies and fruits to your diet Getting more fiber Exercise. Try to get 30 to 60 minutes of physical activity every day. You can walk, bike, swim, or do anything else that gets your heart rate up. Pair that with strength training, like yoga or weightlifting. If you take a medication that lowers your blood sugar, you might need a snack before a workout. Watch your blood sugar levels. Depending on your treatment, especially if you’re on insulin, your doctor will tell you if you need to test your blood sugar levels and how often to do it.', 'Medication If lifestyle changes don’t get you to your target blood sugar levels, you may need medication. Some of the most common for type 2 diabetes include: Metformin (Fortamet, Glucophage, Glumetza, Riomet). This is usually the first medication used to treat type 2 diabetes . It lowers the amount of glucose your liver makes and helps your body respond better to the insulin it does make. Sulfonylureas. This group of drugs helps your body make more insulin. They include glimepiride (Amaryl), glipizide (Glucotrol), and glyburide (DiaBeta, Micronase). Meglitinides. They help your body make more insulin, and they work faster than sulfonylureas. You might take nateglinide (Starlix) or repaglinide (Prandin). Thiazolidinediones. Like metformin, they make you more sensitive to insulin. You could get pioglitazone (Actos) or rosiglitazone (Avandia). But they also raise your risk of heart problems, so they aren’t usually a first choice for treatment. DPP-4 inhibitors. These medications -- linagliptin (Tradjenta), saxagliptin (Onglyza), and sitagliptin (Januvia) -- help lower your blood sugar levels, but they can also cause joint pain and could inflame your pancreas. They work by blocking DPP-4, which is an enzyme that affects the hormone incretin. GLP-1 receptor agonists. You take these medications with a needle to slow digestion and lower blood sugar levels. Some of the most common ones are exenatide (Byetta, Bydureon), liraglutide (Victoza), and semaglutide (Ozempic). SGLT2 inhibitors. These help your kidneys filter out more glucose. You might get bexagliflozin (Brenzavvy), canagliflozin (Invokana), dapagliflozin (Farxiga), or empagliflozin (Jardiance). Empagliflozin has also proven effective in reducing\xa0the risk of hospitalization or death from heart failure. GIP and GLP-1\xa0receptor agonist. Tirzepatide (Mounjaro) is the first in its class and\xa0activates both the GLP-1 and GIP receptors, which leads to improved blood sugar control. Insulin. You might take long-lasting shots at night, such as insulin detemir (Levemir) or insulin glargine (Lantus). Even if you change your lifestyle and take your medicine as directed, your blood sugar may still get worse over time. That doesn’t mean you’ve done something wrong. Diabetes is progressive, and many people eventually need more than one drug.', 'When you take more than one drug to control your type 2 diabetes, that’s called combination therapy. You and your doctor should work together to find the best mix for you. Some drugs control blood sugar spikes (your doctor may call this hyperglycemia ) that come right after meals, for instance. Others are more effective at stopping drops in blood sugar (hypoglycemia) between meals. Some may help with weight loss or cholesterol, as well as your diabetes. You and your doctor should talk about any possible side effects. Cost may be an issue as well. If you take medication for something else, that will need to be factored into any decision. You’ll need to see your doctor more often when you start taking a new combination of drugs. You might find that adding a second drug doesn’t bring your blood sugar under control. Or the combination of two drugs might work only for a short time. If that happens, your doctor might consider a third non-insulin drug, or you may start insulin therapy.', ""Surgeries\xa0for type 2 diabetes Weight loss surgery can effectively treat type 2 diabetes by helping you to lose weight . These procedures limit how much food you can eat or how many nutrients your body can take in.

Members of racial and ethnic minority groups with type 2 are also likely to have worse health outcomes. Yet research shows that members of minority groups are less likely to use newer diabetes medications, regardless of their income or whether they have health insurance . And no matter what their ethnicity, people with lower incomes were less likely to take these medications. Across all races and ethnicities with diabetes, about 15% live in poverty, 19% have difficulties accessing food, and 51% have low-quality diets.

If your kidneys are damaged or you have kidney failure, you could need dialysis or a kidney replacement. Eyes. High blood sugar can damage the tiny blood vessels in the backs of your eyes. If this isn’t treated, it can cause blindness. Nerves. This can lead to trouble with digestion, the feeling in your feet, and your sexual response. Skin. Your blood doesn’t circulate as well, so wounds heal slower and can become infected. Pregnancy. Parents with diabetes are more likely to have a miscarriage , a stillbirth, or a baby with a birth defect. Sleep. You might develop sleep apnea, a condition in which your breathing stops and starts while you sleep. Hearing. You’re more likely to have hearing problems, but it’s not clear why. Brain. High blood sugar can damage your brain and might put you at higher risk of Alzheimer’s disease. Depression. People with the disease are twice as likely to get depressed as people who don’t have it.

You may have other costs as well, such as lost time and less productivity at work."", 'Managing type 2 diabetes Managing your type 2 diabetes well helps you avoid complications and feel your best. Along with a healthy diet, regular exercise , and medication as prescribed: Keep your blood pressure and cholesterol levels in the healthy range. High levels of either could raise your risk of diabetes complications. Get regular eye exams, dentist visits, and physicals. Check your feet daily for sores, redness, or swelling and let your doctor know if you notice any issues. Get at least 7 hours of good-quality sleep each night, as sleep loss interferes with blood sugar control. Ask your doctor for help if you have a hard time sleeping. Be careful with alcohol. Limit alcoholic drinks to 1-2 drinks a day, depending on your size and gender. If you do drink alcohol, check your blood sugar afterward. Work with your doctor to come up with a sick day plan. Even a minor illness can interfere with your blood sugar and insulin levels. You may need to adjust your medications or check your blood sugar more often. Type 2 diabetes and mental health', ""A long-term health condition can take a toll on your mental health. People with diabetes are more than twice as likely to have depression , and 20% more likely to have anxiety, than those without the condition. Many don't get diagnosed or treated, even though therapy, medication, or a combination can work very well. Many people with diabetes sometimes get overwhelmed by the pressures of trying to manage the condition. This is called diabetes distress, and it can lead to you to neglect your health. A support group or counseling could help you overcome it. If you're worried about your emotional health, ask your doctor to recommend a mental health professional."", 'Type 2 Diabetes Prognosis The long-term outlook for people with type 2 varies, depending on how effectively they manage the condition. At age 50, the average life expectancy (LE) for those with type 2 is 6 years shorter than those without the condition. But proper care and treatment can help you improve those odds.', 'Can type 2 diabetes be cured? There\'s no cure for type 2. You may be able to get your blood sugar under control by losing weight and making healthy lifestyle changes , and might even be able to stop taking diabetes medications. But this isn\'t the case for everyone. What to expect with type 2 diabetes Type 2 is a serious condition that calls for a lifelong commitment to managing it. Over the long term, high blood sugar can lead to heart, vision, and kidney problems. But you can take steps to avoid these complications and extend your life. Several studies show that: Reducing your A1c levels from 10% to under 8% can increase life expectancy by almost 3.5 years. Quitting smoking can increase LE in women over 50 by almost a year, and by almost 2 years in men over 70. Lowering LDL (""bad"") cholesterol can improve LE by almost a year. All these things also reduce your risk of developing other diseases.', ""Type 2 Diabetes Prevention Adopting a healthy lifestyle can help you lower your risk of diabetes : Lose weight. Dropping just 7% to 10% of your weight can cut your risk of type 2 diabetes in half. Get active. 30 minutes of brisk walking a day will cut your risk by almost a third. Eat right. Avoid highly processed carbs, sugary drinks, and trans and saturated fats. Limit red and processed meats. Quit smoking. Work with your doctor to keep from gaining weight after you quit , so you don't create one problem by solving another."", 'Takeaways Type 2 diabetes is a serious condition that requires lifelong management. Weight loss, a healthy lifestyle, and medications, if needed, can help you keep it under control. They can also help you live a longer, healthier life.']"
19,Type 2 Diabetes in Children,"[""Years ago, it was rare to hear about a child with type 2 diabetes . Doctors used to think kids only got type 1. It was even called juvenile diabetes for a long time. Not anymore. Now, according to the CDC, more than 208,000 people younger than 20 have diabetes. That number includes both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Here's what you need to know if your child is diagnosed with type 2."", ""What Is Type 2 Diabetes? You've probably heard diabetes and high blood sugar mentioned together. Here's what happens. Your digestive system breaks down carbohydrates into a type of sugar called glucose. Your pancreas creates a hormone, known as insulin , that moves glucose from your blood into your cells, where it’s used for fuel. In type 2 diabetes , the cells in your child's body don’t respond to the insulin, and glucose builds up in their bloodstream. This is called insulin resistance. Eventually, the sugar levels in their body get too high for it to handle. That could lead to other conditions in the future, like heart disease , blindness, and kidney failure."", ""Who Gets It? Type 2 diabetes is most likely to affect kids who are: Girls Overweight Have a family history of diabetes American Indian, African American, Asian, or Hispanic/Latino Have a problem called insulin resistance The single biggest cause of type 2 diabetes in children is extra weight. In the U.S., nearly 1 out of every 3 children are overweight. Once a child gets too heavy, they're twice as likely to get diabetes. One or more of these things may contribute to extra weight or obesity: Unhealthy eating Lack of physical activity Family members (alive or dead) who've been overweight Rarely, a hormone problem or other medical condition As with adults, type 2 diabetes is more likely to affect children who carry extra weight around the middle."", 'What Are the Symptoms? At first, there may be no symptoms. Over time, you may notice: Unexplained weight loss Hungry or thirsty a lot, even after eating Dry mouth Peeing a lot Fatigue Blurred vision Heavy breathing Slow healing of sores or cuts Itchy skin Numbness or tingling in the hands or feet Take your child to the doctor if you notice any of these symptoms.', ""How Is It Treated? The first step is to get your child to the doctor. They can tell if they're overweight based on their age, weight , and height. They’ll test their blood sugar to see if they have diabetes or prediabetes . If they do have diabetes, it may take a few extra steps to find out if it's type 1 or type 2. Until they know for sure, they may give them insulin. Once they confirm it's type 2 diabetes, they’ll ask you to help them make lifestyle changes. They may suggest they take a medication called metformin. It, along with liraglutide and insulin, are the only three blood sugar-lowering medicines approved for kids younger than age 18, but others are being studied. Your child should get a hemoglobin A1c test every 3 months. This test measures their average blood sugar levels over that period. They’ll need to check their blood sugar: When they start or change treatment If they don't meet their treatment goals If they have to take insulin If they take a sulfonylurea drug"", ""The doctor will teach you both how to test blood sugar and tell you how often. Most experts suggest three or more times a day if they're on insulin. If they're not, they can check less often, but should do it after meals. They can use a traditional finger stick test or a continuous glucose monitor."", ""Steps You Can Take To keep your child’s eating on track and blood sugar controlled: Work with a dietitian to create a meal plan: Three meals a day and a few scheduled snacks in between. Keep portion sizes sensible. Have about the same amount of carbs at each meal to help prevent blood sugar spikes after eating. Carbs affect blood sugar more than other foods do. Show your child how to count carbs. Pack your child’s school lunch. If they're going to buy lunch, know what's on the menu so you can better manage their insulin and rest of their meals. Pack boxes with juice, snacks, sugar tablets, and other things your child needs to treat low blood sugar . Put their name on the box and give one to your child, school nurse, and a teacher. Plan for them to eat about the same time each day. They should also get exercise for at least 60 minutes every day. Limit their screen time at home to less than 2 hours a day."", 'Get Your Child Involved One of the best things you can do for your child is to have them take part in managing their condition. The more they do, the more confident they’ll be. Use your best judgment for what you think your child can handle. Even as they take on more responsibilities, keep an eye on things and give support when needed. At ages 3-7, they can: Choose which finger to use to check blood sugar levels. Pick where to get the insulin shot. Count before taking out the insulin pen or syringe. At ages 8-11, they may: Give themselves insulin while you watch. Notice low blood sugar symptoms and treat themselves. Learn carb counting and start picking some healthy food choices. At age 12 and up, they may: Check blood sugar and take insulin increasingly on their own. Count carbs. Set reminders on when to take pills or check levels. Teen years can bring new challenges. Physical changes during puberty that can make it harder to control blood sugar. Also, weight and body image issues may start to show up. Watch your child for emotional issues, like depression and anxiety , and look out for eating disorders, too. If you have concerns, talk to their doctor. You may want to consider therapy .', ""Tips to Keep Your Child Safe Follow these tips to help keep your child safe and healthy at home and at school: Make sure that your child wears a medical ID bracelet or necklace at all times. This is especially important when they're not with you. Give the school a detailed written plan for how to manage your child’s condition, including how to give insulin injections, meal and snack schedules, and a target blood sugar range. You can create this yourself or use a template called the Diabetes Medical Management Plan. Create a 504 or an Individualized Education Program . These documents take what’s in your child’s diabetes medical plan and spell out the school’s responsibilities. They help keep your child safe and make sure they get the same education and opportunities as everyone else. Make sure your child’s school, coaches, friends’ parents, and others know how to reach you and your child’s doctor in case of emergency. Teach your child, family, and anyone responsible for your child how to notice low blood sugar and what to do about it. Try to keep calm when your child makes mistakes managing diabetes . You need your child to feel comfortable telling you when something’s wrong instead of trying to hide it."", ""Can You Prevent It? The same steps used to treat type 2 diabetes in children can also prevent it. Reduce calories, unhealthy fats, and sweets in your child's diet. Make sure they get physical activity each day. Studies show that exercise has a dramatic effect on reducing insulin resistance. These are two important ways to help your child get down to and stay at a healthy weight and normal blood sugar levels ."", ""Special Concerns Children -- especially teens -- may have a tough time making changes to prevent or manage type 2 diabetes. Here are some ways you can help: Talk with your child honestly about health and weight. Be supportive. Encourage them to speak up about their concerns. Don't separate your child for special treatment. Your entire family can benefit from making changes in diet and activity. Make changes slowly. Just as it took time for diabetes to develop, it will take time to achieve better health. Do more activities your child enjoys. Lower the amount of time your family spends watching TV or playing video games. If your child refuses to follow their plan, try to find out why. Teens, for example, are dealing with hormone changes, demands on their time, peer pressure , and other things that seem more important to them than their health. Set small, easy-to-reach goals. Plan special rewards for your child when they meet each goal. Then move on to the next. Talk to a diabetes educator, doctor, dietitian, or other diabetes professional for more ideas on how to help your child become healthier. By working together, you, your child, and their diabetes health care team can be sure they remain healthy for years to come.""]"
20,Early Signs and Symptoms of Type 2 Diabetes,"['Early Signs and Symptoms of Type 2 Diabetes Type 2 diabetes is a disease in which your body doesn’t make enough of a hormone called insulin or doesn’t use insulin the way it should. Insulin helps carry glucose (also called sugar) to your cells. So when there’s a problem with the insulin, glucose builds up in your blood. You’ve probably heard this called high blood sugar. About 90% of people who have diabetes have type 2. The other two main ones are type 1, in which your body stops making insulin, and gestational, which happens in pregnant women. You can usually control type 2 diabetes with lifestyle changes. Some people also need medication. You might not know that you have type 2 diabetes until it affects your health. About 1 in 4 people with the condition don’t know that they have it. Symptoms can come on slowly. They\xa0may include: More thirst. When sugar builds up in your\xa0blood, your kidneys work overtime to get rid of it. This pulls fluids from your tissues and makes you dehydrated, so you feel thirsty. More\xa0hunger. Because diabetes\xa0can stop glucose from getting to your cells, you feel hungry, even after you’ve eaten. Peeing often. You’ll pee more because your kidneys are working to get rid of extra sugar in your system. Dry mouth. Dehydration\xa0and peeing a lot can drain moisture from your\xa0mouth\xa0as well. Weight loss without trying. When you lose sugar from peeing a lot, you lose calories, too. You might lose weight even though you’re eating as usual. Fatigue. When your body can’t use energy from food, you could feel weak and\xa0tired. Dehydration can make you feel this way, too. Blurry vision. High blood sugar can make you have trouble focusing. Headaches. High blood sugar levels can cause your head to hurt. Loss of consciousness. After you exercise, skip a meal, or take too much medication, your blood sugar could go too low, and you could pass out. Infections or sores that don’t heal. High blood sugar can slow blood flow and make it harder for your body to heal. Tingling hands and\xa0feet. Type 2 diabetes\xa0can affect nerves in your hands and feet. Red, swollen, tender gums. You might be more likely to get infections in your gums and the bones that hold your teeth in place. Your gums may get infected or pull away from your\xa0teeth. Your teeth might become loose.', 'Complications of Type 2 Diabetes It’s important to get your blood sugar under control to avoid these serious conditions: Hypoglycemia. If your blood sugar falls below 70 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), it can lead to accidents,\xa0coma, and death. Hyperglycemia. Blood sugar that goes above 180 to 200 mg/dL can give you\xa0heart, nerve, kidney, and vision problems. Over the long term, it also can cause coma and death. Over time, people with type 2 diabetes may have other health problems: Diabetic ketoacidosis. When you don’t have enough\xa0insulin\xa0in your system, your blood sugar rises, and your body breaks down fat for energy. Toxic acids called ketones build up and spill into your\xa0urine. It can cause coma and death if you don’t treat it. Heartand blood vessel diseases. People with diabetes are more likely to have conditions like\xa0high blood pressure\xa0and\xa0high cholesterol, which play a role in\xa0heart disease. Also, high blood sugar can damage your blood vessels and the nerves that control your heart. High blood pressure. Diabetes doubles your risk of high blood pressure, which makes you more likely to have heart disease or\xa0stroke. Nerve damage (diabetic neuropathy). This can cause tingling and numbness, most often in your feet and legs. But it can also affect your\xa0digestive system, urinary tract, blood vessels, and heart. Eyedamage. Diabetes can cause: Glaucoma, a buildup of pressure in your\xa0eyes Cataracts, a cloudiness of your lens Retinopathy, which is damage to the blood vessels in your\xa0eyes Kidney disease. Your kidneys may have to work harder to filter out the extra sugar, along with all the other waste products in your blood. Hearing problems. Doctors aren’t sure why this happens, but they think high blood sugar levels damage the small blood vessels in your\xa0ears. Skin problems. Diabetes can cause: Infections. You’re more likely to get bacterial and fungal infections. Itching. Causes include infections, dry skin, and poor circulation. You might notice it on your lower legs. Acanthosis nigricans. These velvety darker areas can appear on your neck, armpits, groin, hands, elbows, and knees. Diabetic dermopathy. Changes to small blood vessels that look like red or brown scaly patches. They often show up on your feet and the fronts of your legs. Necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum. This rare condition also affects your blood vessels . It starts as a dull, red, raised area, but winds up as a shiny scar with a violet border. Your skin could itch or crack open. Women are more likely to get this than men. Allergic reactions. You could get these in response to insulin or another diabetes medication. Diabetic\xa0blisters(bullosis diabeticorum). These sores look like burn blisters and can show up on the backs of your fingers, hands, toes, feet, and sometimes legs or forearms. Disseminated\xa0granuloma annulare. You might get red, brown, or skin-colored rings or arc-shaped raised areas on your fingers,\xa0ears, or trunk.', 'Type 2 Diabetes in Children Type 2 was once called adult-onset diabetes because it was rare in children and teens. But it has become more common since the mid-1990s, in large part because more young people are overweight or obese, a risk factor for the disease. Children are also at higher risk of type 2 diabetes if they don’t get enough exercise or if they have a close relative with the condition. African American, Hispanic, Native American, Alaska Native, Asian American, and Pacific Islander children are more likely to get it.', 'Type 2 Diabetes in Older Adults Your risk of type 2 diabetes goes up as you age because your body can become resistant to insulin and your pancreas might not work as well as it used to.

It could just be a small problem caused by high blood sugar . Your lens could swell, which changes your ability to see. To correct it, you need to get your blood sugar back into the target range (70-130 milligrams per deciliter, or mg/dL, before meals, and less than 180 mg/dL 1 to 2 hours after a meal). It may take as long as 3 months for your vision to fully get back to normal. Do tell your eye doctor. They\xa0can let you know if this is a symptom of a more serious problem."", 'Cataracts The natural internal lens of your eye allows your eye to see and focus on an image, just like a camera. When that lens gets cloudy, like a dirty or smudged window, that means a c ataract has formed. Anyone can get them , but people with diabetes tend to get them earlier, and they get worse faster.', ""When part of your lens is cloudy, your eye can’t focus like it should. You won't see as well. Symptoms include blurred vision and glare. You’ll need surgery to remove a cataract. The doctor replaces the cloudy lens with an artificial one."", 'Glaucoma People with diabetes are more likely to have glaucoma, which can come in several forms or types. Pressure builds up inside your eye when fluid can’t drain like it should. This can damage nerves and blood vessels, and cause changes in vision. Medications can treat open-angle glaucoma , the most common form. They lower eye pressure, speed up drainage, and reduce the amount of liquid your eye makes. (Your doctor will call this aqueous humor.) This type of glaucoma may not cause any symptoms until it’s further along and you have major vision loss . Your doctor can catch it earlier, during an annual exam.', 'With less common forms of the disease, you might notice: Headaches Eye aches or pain Blurred vision Watery eyes Halos around lights Vision loss', 'Treatment can include medicine and special eye drops. Surgery and laser treatments can help lower eye pressure. If you have diabetes, you’re also more likely to get a rare condition called neovascular glaucoma. This makes new blood vessels grow on the iris, the colored part of your eye. They block the normal flow of fluid and raise eye pressure. The primary treatment of neovascular glaucoma is to reverse the formation of new blood vessels. For this, your doctor may use a laser to reduce the number of blood vessels in the back of the eye, or they\xa0may use an anti-VEGF injection, while using other measures to quickly lower the eye pressure.', ""Diabetic Retinopathy The retina is a group of cells on the back of your eye that take in light. They turn it into images that the optic nerve sends to your brain . Damage to small blood vessels in your retina causes diabetic retinopathy . It's related to high blood sugar levels .

22,Diabetic Ketoacidosis: Do I Have It?,"[""What Is Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA)? Diabetic ketoacidosis , also known as DKA, is a serious complication of diabetes that happens when your body doesn't have enough of a hormone called insulin, which usually creates energy by letting blood sugar into your cells. Instead, your body starts to break down fat for energy, causing ketones to develop in your blood . If your body makes too many ketones at once, the buildup damages your body and makes your blood too acidic, which is called ketoacidosis. If you don’t get medical help in time, DKA can be life-threatening. Symptoms of DKA often build up slowly, so it’s important to know the warning signs, as it can usually be prevented and treated if discovered early. Ketoacidosis blood sugar levels When you don’t have enough insulin, the sugars you eat can’t get out of your blood and into your cells. This makes the sugar build up in your blood, causing high blood sugar.\xa0During diabetic ketoacidosis, your blood sugar will be very high and your insulin levels will be low."", ""If your blood sugar is over 240 mg/dL, you should check your ketones using a urine ketone test or a glucometer (blood ketone test) every 4-6 hours. Ketoacidosis is generally considered to start at 250 mg/dL. Talk to your doctor if your blood sugar level is outside of your target range. Go to the emergency room if your blood sugar is 300 mg/dL or more and won’t go down or if you have any symptoms of DKA, including frequent throwing up, tiredness, or difficulty breathing. Ketoacidosis vs. ketosis Ketoacidosis and ketosis sound similar but are different processes. Typically, your body uses sugar (glucose) for energy. With ketosis, you don’t eat many carbohydrates (foods like bread, pasta, or other starches), which usually turn into sugar quickly, so your body starts burning fat to create energy. Ketones are released into your blood as fat is broken down. Your body makes ketones, but not enough to make your blood too acidic, so ketosis isn’t dangerous. With ketosis, your body has enough insulin and it's working properly. In diabetic ketoacidosis, ketones build up too fast, and your blood becomes acidic. Diabetic ketoacidosis is life-threatening. Diabetic ketoacidosis is a serious complication of diabetes that happens when your body doesn't have enough of a hormone called insulin, which usually creates energy by letting blood sugar into your cells. Talk to your doctor if your blood sugar level is outside of your target range.

The first signs of DKA can include: Urge to pee a lot more than usual High ketones amount Strong thirst Severe headache Dehydration High blood sugar levels (more than 250 mg/dL) If you don’t get medical help, you can have more DKA symptoms, including: Nausea or throwing up (vomiting) Weakness, muscle aches, or stiffness Dry mouth and dry skin Fatigue /feeling very tired Confusion (feeling foggy, or less alert than usual) Flushed face (your face is redder or\xa0feels sweaty or hot) Headache Breath that smells sweet or fruity Pain in your stomach Breathing problems including breathing fast, having trouble catching your breath, or shortness of breath Diabetic ketoacidosis can be very dangerous and even life-threatening. You should go to the emergency room right away if: Your ketones are moderate or high and you have any DKA symptoms You have more than one symptom of DKA, even if you haven’t tested your ketones yet Your blood sugar is 300 or more, and it isn’t going down You’re throwing up and you can’t keep food or water down, or you’ve been throwing up for more than 2 hours Your breath smells sweet or fruity Your blood sugar stays higher than your target range, even when you do your usual home treatments You’re very tired , woozy, or confused (foggy feeling) You feel queasy or your belly hurts It’s hard to breathe', 'If you have the symptoms described above, you should go to the emergency room or call 911, even if you haven’t been told you have diabetes. HHS vs. DKA Another condition that can sometimes seem like diabetic ketoacidosis is\xa0hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state, also called HHS. HHS and DKA have similar symptoms, including feeling very thirsty, having to pee more than usual, dry mouth, and feeling confused or less alert, weak, or nauseous. Both HHS and DKA can happen when your blood sugar is too high.', 'With HHS, very high blood sugar over a long period makes you dehydrate (lose water), causing your blood to get too concentrated. This can harm your brain, kidneys, heart, and other parts of your body. HHS is more likely to happen to people with type 2 diabetes. Symptoms of HHS that usually don’t happen with DKA include blurry vision or suddenly losing your ability to see, trouble moving your body, especially on only one side, and seeing things that aren’t usually there (hallucinations).', 'A big difference is that with HHS, your body doesn’t make too many ketones. HHS also takes longer than DKA to develop, and your blood sugar is usually higher (600 or above) than it is in DKA. People who develop HHS are more likely to die from it (about 10 or 20 of every 100 people). On the other hand, only about 1 to 8 in 100 people who get DKA die from it.', ""Diabetic Ketoacidosis Causes Diabetic ketoacidosis usually happens because your body doesn't have enough insulin . Your cells can't use the sugar in your blood for energy, so they use fat for fuel instead. Burning fat makes acids called ketones. If the process goes on for a while, they could build up in your blood. Having too many ketones can change the chemical balance of your blood and throw off your entire system. Certain things can make your blood sugar go up and your insulin go down, which makes your body more likely to start burning fat and building up ketones. These include: Missing insulin doses and diabetes mismanagement. If you miss doses of insulin or other medications a lot, or if your doctor prescribed the wrong dose, etc., your blood sugar might be further away from your target. You are at higher risk for DKA when your diabetes is not well-managed. Timing of diabetes diagnosis. People who don’t know they are diabetic and people who just found out that they have diabetes are more likely to get DKA. This is probably because they don’t have as much experience managing their diabetes . How you take your insulin. People who give themselves shots of insulin are more likely to get DKA than people who use an insulin pump. However, if you use an insulin pump and it gets clogged or stops working, you’re at risk for DKA because your body won’t get the amount of insulin you need until your pump gets fixed. Using expired insulin. If your insulin is spoiled or expired, it might not work as well as it should. Other things that could lead to DKA include: Being sick or stressed. When you’re sick or under a lot of stress, your body makes more stress hormones, including adrenaline and cortisol. These hormones can get in the way of insulin and stop it from helping sugar get inside your cells. Talk to your doctor about whether you’ll need higher doses of insulin if you’re sick. Infections. Common sicknesses that sometimes lead to DKA are urinary tract infections (also called UTIs or bladder infections) and\xa0pneumonia. Trauma to your body. Getting hurt or needing surgery also makes your body send out stress hormones that get in the way of insulin, which can lead to DKA. Heart attacks, strokes, and blood clots. These problems with your heart, lungs, and blood flow can all cause DKA. Pancreatitis (inflammation in your pancreas). This can lead to DKA, and it can also be a symptom of it. Many people with pancreatitis have bad stomach pain. Pregnancy. Being pregnant changes how your body processes sugars and other nutrients. Pregnant people who have diabetes are at higher risk of DKA. Alcohol, drugs, and certain medicines. Drinking alcohol and using drugs such as cocaine can put you at higher risk of DKA. Some medications, such as corticosteroids, water pills (diuretics), and those used to treat serious mental health conditions can also lead to DKA. Make sure your doctor or health care provider knows you have diabetes whenever they prescribe you a new medication. Talk to your doctor or a mental health professional if you or other people in your life are worried about your alcohol or drug use."", ""DKA Risk Factors Anyone who has diabetes can get diabetic ketoacidosis. Some people find out that they have diabetes only after they get DKA. However, certain things make you more likely than other people with diabetes to get DKA. These risk factors include: Type of diabetes. People with type 1 diabetes are more likely to get DKA, and it’s often more serious than it is in people with type 2 diabetes.\xa0Type 1 diabetes means that your body doesn’t make insulin, or just makes a very small amount. People with type 2 diabetes can still get DKA if the insulin they do make isn’t enough to stop their body from making ketones. Age. Older adults are more likely to get complications from diabetes, including DKA, and it can be even more serious than it is in younger people. Among children with diabetes, kids under 5 are more likely to get it. Children assigned female at birth are more likely to get it around the age of puberty. Access to insulin. In the U.S., about 1 in 5 people with diabetes who need insulin don't take their insulin as often as their doctor wants them to, take smaller doses than they need, or go without because insulin costs too much. If you can’t afford to take as much insulin as you need, you have a higher risk of getting DKA. Talk to your doctor about programs to help people afford insulin. Missing meals.

Undiagnosed Type 1 diabetes can lead to DKA."", 'Diabetic Ketoacidosis Diagnosis Your doctor will figure out if you have DKA by doing a physical exam and asking you about your symptoms, experiences, and medical history. They’ll check your blood sugar, ketones in your pee and/or blood, and your blood pH and bicarbonate levels. Your doctor might also do tests to diagnose DKA or check how it’s affecting you. These include: Basic metabolic panel. Blood tests check how well your kidneys, liver, and pancreas are working. These look at the levels of different chemicals in your blood such as salt, electrolytes, and potassium. Blood\xa0pH. PH is a measure of how acidic things are. Because ketones can make your blood too acidic, doctors will take blood to check its pH level. Blood pH levels under 7.3 are too acidic. Blood glucose test (A1C) .\xa0This blood test looks at how your blood sugar has been over the last few months and how controlled your diabetes has been overall. You can also check your sugar levels at home with a urine test strip. Testing your pee (urinalysis). Looking at a sample of pee helps your doctor measure your ketones, sugar, and other nutrients. They might also measure how much pee you make (to make sure that you aren’t getting dehydrated) and test for infections.', ""Other diagnostic testing for DKA includes: Ketone test Arterial blood gas Blood pressure Osmolality Your doctor might give you a chest X-ray, CAT scan, or MRI to rule out other problems or get more information about how DKA is impacting you. They may also recommend tests for your heart (electrocardiogram, or ECG) to check how it's working. Testing for ketones You can check yourself for ketones at home with a urine sample. You can buy kits for testing your pee over the counter.\xa0Some glucose meters can also test for ketones in the blood sample when you do a finger prick. Ask your doctor to show you how to do an at-home ketone test if you have any questions. If you have diabetes, it’s important to follow advice from your doctor about when to test for ketones. In general, you should test for ketones in these situations: If your blood sugar is 240 mg/dL or more.

Good blood sugar control will help you avoid ketoacidosis in the future. Make sure you manage your diabetes through your diet , exercise , medications , and self-care. Follow these steps to help prevent DKA: Drink lots of water or sugar -free, nonalcoholic beverages. Take your medicines as directed. Follow your meal plan closely. Keep up with your exercise program. Test your blood sugar regularly. Check for expired insulin. Don't use your insulin dose if it has clumps. Insulin should either be clear or evenly cloudy with small flecks. If you're on an insulin pump , look closely for insulin leaks, and check your tube connections for air bubbles. Talk to your doctor if your blood sugar levels are often out of your target range. Manage your insulin dose with help from your doctor or diabetes coach. Make adjustments based on your blood sugar levels, diet, activity levels, or during any illness. Create a DKA emergency plan. If your blood sugar levels are too high or your urine has too many ketones, make a plan to go to the hospital."", 'Takeaways Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a serious complication of diabetes that can be life-threatening. With DKA, your body doesn’t have enough insulin to process sugar, so it starts burning fats instead. This creates ketones that can build up and begin to poison your system if you don’t get medical help in time. You can prevent DKA by keeping your blood sugar in your target range. Make sure to go to the doctor or emergency room right away if you have any DKA symptoms such as being very thirsty, having to pee a lot, fruity-smelling breath, or feeling confused or weak.', 'Diabetic Ketoacidosis FAQs How long does it take to recover from diabetic ketoacidosis? The goal of diabetic ketoacidosis treatment is to get your blood back into balance and lower your blood sugar. That way, your body won’t make ketones anymore. This usually takes about 24 hours, but it might take longer if your DKA was severe or didn’t get treated soon enough. You can usually leave the hospital about a day after your blood sugar gets down to 200 mg/dL or less and your blood pH is over 7.3. What happens when a diabetic goes into ketoacidosis? When a person with diabetes goes into ketoacidosis, it means that too many ketones have built up in their blood. Ketones are made when your body starts burning fat because it thinks that your cells need fuel. This happens when your blood sugar is high but you don’t have enough insulin to help the sugar get into your cells to “feed” them. Diabetic ketoacidosis can be treated and you can get better from it, especially if you get medical help right away.']"

It checks how well you see at different distances. A dilated eye exam . Your doctor will use drops to widen your pupils and look at the inside of your eyes. They'll look for signs of disease, including damaged or leaking blood vessels, swelling, and fatty deposits on the retina. If your doctor thinks you have DME, you may also need one or both of these tests: A fluorescein angiogram (FA) takes pictures of your retina using a special dye that helps find any leaking blood vessels. The dye is injected into your arm but travels quickly to your eye. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) uses a special camera to photograph your retina.

Other things that can raise your odds of diabetic retinopathy include: High blood pressure High cholesterol Tobacco use Being African American, Hispanic, or Native American', 'Stages Diabetic retinopathy tends to go through these four stages: Mild nonproliferative retinopathy. In the disease’s earliest stage, tiny blood vessels in your retina change. Small areas swell. These are called microaneurysms. Fluid can leak out of them and into your retina. Moderate nonproliferative retinopathy. As your disease gets worse, blood vessels that should keep your retina healthy swell and change shape. They can’t deliver blood to your retina. This can change the way your retina looks. These blood vessel changes can trigger diabetic macular edema (DME). That’s swelling in the area of your retina called the macula . Severe nonproliferative retinopathy. In the third stage, many blood vessels get blocked. They can’t deliver blood to your retina to keep it healthy. Areas of your retina where this happens make special proteins called growth factors that tell your retina to grow new blood vessels. Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). This is the most advanced stage. New blood vessels grow inside your retina and then into the jelly inside your eyeballs called vitreous humor. Fragile new blood vessels are more likely to leak fluid and bleed. Scar tissue starts to form. This can cause retinal detachment , when your retina pulls away from the tissue underneath. This can lead to permanent blindness.', ""Diagnosis Your eye doctor can usually tell if you have diabetic retinopathy during your eye exam . Pupil dilation.

Potential risks of this type of dialysis include infection, poor blood flow, blockage from scar tissue, blood clots, anemia, and sudden heart attack.', ""Peritoneal dialysis: Your blood is cleaned inside your body. A special fluid is put into your abdomen to absorb waste from the blood that passes through small vessels in your abdominal cavity. The fluid is then drained away. This type of dialysis is typically done at home. Potential risks of this type of dialysis include skin infections around the catheter, as well as an infection called peritonitis that can happen when bacteria gets inside your abdomen through the catheter. The abdominal catheter, and pumping your belly full of fluid, can weaken your abdominal muscles and may lead to a hernia. This type of dialysis can also lead to weight gain. Continuous renal replacement therapy is also a type of dialysis that's done as a life-saving measure for unstable patients in the ICU who can't tolerate regular dialysis.

In more serious cases, the skin may be cracked, sore, or bleeding. Irritant dermatitis"", ""This is the most common type of diaper rash. It often happens when your baby's skin is irritated by urine and poop in a diaper. Pink or red patches show up on the areas of the body covered by the diaper, like the bottom, but not usually in the skin folds.

You may see a red rash wherever the product came into contact with your baby's skin."", ""Diaper Rash Treatments The first and best thing to do is to keep your baby's bottom clean and dry. Follow these steps when changing your baby: Rinse the diaper area with warm water and pat (not rub) it dry. Use soap only if the poop doesn't come off easily. If the area is really sore, try a squirt bottle to wash without rubbing sore skin. If possible, let your baby's bottom air-dry or use a towel. Don't use talcum powder, which can be harmful if your baby breathes it in. Apply a diaper cream or ointment. Rediaper your baby"", ""Diaper rash cream Creams form a barrier on your baby's skin and keep urine and poop from touching and damaging it. Creams tend to have less oil than ointments and so can spread easily. Most diaper creams have zinc oxide, which forms a waterproof layer on the skin. Zinc oxide also improves skin healing. Skip the steroid creams (hydrocortisone) you find in the drugstore unless the doctor tells you to use one. They can irritate your baby's bottom even more if you don't use them the right way. Diaper rash ointment Diaper ointments tend to be heavier and have more oil than diaper creams. They spread less easily than creams but are a stronger barrier against irritants. But they don't allow air to flow through the skin. White petroleum jelly (petrolatum) can be an effective diaper ointment. Many medicated skin care products come in ointment form.

But not all of them are effective—and some can make the problem worse. Your best bet is to check with your pediatrician before trying a home remedy. Breast milk for diaper rash Applying human breast milk to your baby's bottom is safe, but the jury's out on how effective it is. One study found it worked as well as a mild hydrocortisone ointment. But other research found that a cream that included zinc oxide worked better. Cornstarch for diaper rash Avoid using cornstarch on diaper rash. It can irritate the skin and even infect it. It's also ineffective because it actually holds moisture in. Coconut oil for diaper rash While there's no scientific evidence that coconut oil is effective for a diaper rash, it's a gentle, natural moisturizer. But moisturizing may not be enough to clear up a diaper rash.

Check your baby's diaper often, and change it as soon as it gets wet or soiled. Use plain water to clean the diaper area. When you need to get poop off your baby's skin, use a mild cleanser. Check that the area is completely clean and dry before putting on a fresh diaper. Gently pat the area dry, rather than rubbing it. If you use wipes, choose mild ones. Avoid those with fragrances or alcohol. Or use a clean, soft washcloth. Apply a diaper cream or ointment with each diaper change if your baby gets diaper rash regularly. Make sure diapers aren't fastened too tightly to allow some airflow. Let your baby go diaper-free when possible. Airing out the diaper zone helps skin heal faster and reduces rashes.

29,Birth Control: Is the Diaphragm Right for You?,"['Women have been using the diaphragm for birth control in one form or another for hundreds of years. It’s a small, flexible cup made of silicone or latex that goes inside the vagina to block sperm from reaching an egg. It has very few risks and can be up to 94% effective. Here’s how to decide if it’s right for you.', 'How do you use a diaphragm? You need to use a diaphragm along with a cream or gel that kills sperm, called a spermicide. First squeeze about a tablespoon of spermicide inside the cup of the diaphragm and spread more around the rim. To put it in: Get in a comfortable position with your legs open and knees bent. Fold the diaphragm in half, with your index finger inside to help guide it. With your other hand, open your labia, then push the diaphragm as far up and back inside your vagina as it will go. The diaphragm should cover the narrow opening to your uterus, called the cervix , and the front edge should tuck behind your pubic bone.', 'You can put it in up to 6 hours before you have sex, and you need to leave it in for at least 6 hours after. Once it’s in place, you can have sex more than once, but you need to reapply spermicide before each time. Do that with your fingers or an applicator, making sure to get it deep inside your vagina. Most spermicides only work if you use them less than an hour before you have sex. So if you put the diaphragm in hours ahead of time, remember to add more. You can leave the diaphragm in for up to 24 hours. To remove it: Hook your finger over the rim and pull it down and out. If you have trouble, ask your doctor about a special tool that can help. Clean the diaphragm with soap and water, let it air dry, and store it in its case. Avoid oil-based lubricants, which can damage silicone. Check it every so often for holes or cracks.', 'How well do they work? How well a diaphragm prevents pregnancy depends a lot on whether you use it correctly. Six out of 100 women will get pregnant with the diaphragm if they use it perfectly every time. Most people make mistakes sometimes, so the typical rate is more like 12 to 18 out of 100. That’s more effective than condoms or other barrier methods, but less effective than sterilization, intrauterine devices (IUDs), or birth control pills . There are some risks that come with a diaphragm. The most serious one is toxic shock syndrome , a condition you get from a bacterial infection . You can avoid it by not leaving a diaphragm in for more than 24 hours. The device also can cause irritation or a reaction if you’re allergic to latex. And some women get urinary tract infections more often when they use a diaphragm.', 'Where do you get a diaphragm? You need a prescription to get one, so see your doctor or other health care professional.\xa0 A traditional\xa0diaphragm requires fitting; the Caya, a newer type, is a one-size-fits-most\xa0(but is less reliable for preventing pregnancy).', ""The diaphragm isn't for everyone: you can’t use it if you have poor pelvic muscle tone or problems with the shape of your vagina.

You can choose to use a diaphragm, even if your partner doesn’t want to use a condom . If it’s in correctly, you and your partner can’t feel it. If you want to try to get pregnant , just stop using it. It doesn’t affect your body’s natural hormones. You can use it while you’re breastfeeding . Since you can put it in and apply spermicide an hour before you have sex, you don’t have to interrupt the mood.', ""What are the cons? The diaphragm doesn’t protect against STDs. You have to remember to reapply spermicide every time you have sex. It can be tough and messy to put one in. You can use it during your period, but it may put you at higher risk for an infection if it isn't removed soon after sex. You might knock it out of place during sex. You have to see a doctor to get one."", 'Is the diaphragm right for you? The diaphragm may be a good choice for birth control if you want to avoid hormones and if you want something that you can easily reverse if you want to get pregnant.

31,Meniere’s Disease,"[""What Is Meniere’s Disease? Meniere’s disease is a rare inner ear condition that can cause vertigo , tinnitus (ringing in your ear), and hearing loss. Vertigo is a specific type of dizziness in which you feel like you’re spinning. Usually, only one ear is affected. It tends to progress slowly, but your hearing loss can become permanent. Vertigo and nausea are some of the main symptoms of Meniere's disease. (Photo Credit: iStock/Getty Images) It's called Meniere's disease after Prosper Ménière, a French doctor. In the 1860s, he suggested that the symptoms were caused by problems in the inner ear and not the brain as most people believed at the time."", ""Meniere’s Disease Causes Your symptoms are caused when a fluid called endolymph builds up inside a couple of organs in your inner ear that are important for your ability to hear and tell where your body is in space. These organs are: Cochlea. This is an organ in your inner ear that's shaped like a snail. It's filled with a fluid that vibrates when sound waves pass over it. The vibrations cause nerve endings in your cochlea to move. This changes vibrations into electrical impulses that travel to your brain through one of the main nerves in your head. Your brain interprets this as sound. When you have extra fluid built up in your cochlea, it can interfere with this process and cause hearing loss."", ""Vestibular labyrinth. This is an organ in your inner ear that helps with your sense of balance. If you have a smartphone, it probably has an accelerometer, which is how your phone “knows” which direction is up. Your vestibular labyrinth sort of acts like a biological accelerometer in your ear. It helps you balance as you move around and tells you where your body and head are in space. Again, when you have extra fluid built up, the signals may be scrambled, causing trouble with your sense of balance. Although this fluid buildup causes the symptoms of Meniere's disease, it also happens in people with other disorders, such as idiopathic sensorineural hearing loss. So, your doctor will have to test you for many different conditions before they can confirm that you have Meniere's disease."", ""Researchers don't know why the fluid builds up in your inner ear, but their most common theories suggest that something has disrupted how your body balances making and breaking down endolymph in your ear. This could be because of: Allergic reactions or autoimmune conditions (when your immune system mistakenly attacks your body tissues) Viral infections Genetic factors Narrowing of blood vessels (similar to what happens with m igraine headaches ) Most researchers think that several of these issues come together to cause Meniere’s disease."", ""Meniere's Disease Risk Factors You may have a higher risk of getting Meniere's disease if: You have an autoimmune condition, especially rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, or ankylosing spondylitis Someone in your family has the condition (about 7%-10% of people with Meniere's disease have a family history) You're 40-60 years old You're assigned female at birth (AFAB)"", ""Meniere’s Disease Symptoms Symptoms usually include: Hearing loss, which may get worse over time. Episodes of sudden dizziness or vertigo that last 20 minutes to 24 hours. You usually won't faint or pass out, but you may have abnormal eye movements, making you feel like the room is spinning. Nausea or vomiting may follow. Some people may have “drop attacks,” which is when you fall on the ground because you are so dizzy. Ringing in your ears (tinnitus), which may get worse right before a vertigo episode and go away afterward. A feeling of fullness or pressure in your ear. Any of your symptoms may come and go, or get worse and then better."", 'Meniere’s is a progressive disease, which means it tends to get worse over time. It may start slowly with occasional hearing loss . Vertigo may develop later. Attacks can last 20 minutes or as long as 24 hours. You might get several in a week, or they might come months or even years apart. Afterward, you may feel tired and need to rest. Along with the main symptoms, some people may have anxiety, as they may worry too much about when and how a sudden vertigo attack will affect them. Some people also get depression due to the main symptoms, which can make it difficult for them to live their day-to-day lives. Your doctor may describe the symptoms in three stages: Stage I (early stage). In this stage, you may have unpredictable attacks of vertigo. You will have some amount of hearing loss and a feeling of fullness during these attacks. Sometimes, you may get ringing in your affected ear right before the attack, and they usually happen without warning. In between your attacks, your hearing and feeling of fullness may go back to usual. Stage II (intermediate stage). In this stage, you will likely still get vertigo attacks, but they may not be as bad. After the vertigo attack and sometimes before, you may feel unbalanced or giddy when you move around. You may get some permanent hearing loss that worsens during vertigo attacks. Ringing in your ear may get worse and increase during a vertigo attack. Stage III (late stage). In this stage, your vertigo attacks may stop or go away, but your hearing loss may get worse. At this point, you likely have permanent damage to the balance organs in your inner ear. You may also have trouble keeping your balance, especially in the dark.', ""Meniere’s Disease \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bDiagnosis Meniere's disease is very rare, although the main symptoms are fairly common. To be diagnosed with it, you need to have: Two or more vertigo attacks Hearing loss confirmed by a hearing test Tinnitus or a feeling of fullness or pressure in the ear Your doctor will examine your ears and ask you questions to help rule out other potential causes of your symptoms. To help figure out what's causing your symptoms, your doctor may use a few different tests: Hearing tests (audiometry). Audiometry tests how well you can hear sounds at different pitches and volumes and how well you can distinguish words that sound the same. For instance, your ability to tell the difference between words such as “fit” and “sit.” People with Meniere's disease may have hearing loss at both high and low frequencies, although their hearing may be fine in the middle frequencies. Balance tests (vestibular test battery) to see how well your inner ear is working, such as: Electronystagmography (ENG) or videonystagmography (VNG) . These tests assess your balance. You will sit in a darkened room, and your doctor will measure your eye movements as you follow a target, move your head, and feel cool and warm air blowing into your ear canal. Rotary chair testing. You sit in a computer-controlled chair that spins to trigger your inner ear, then your doctor will track your eye movements. Vestibular evoked myogenic potential (VEMP). This measures how well the muscles in your inner ear react to sounds. Computerized dynamic posturography (CDP). This tests how well you can keep your balance under different conditions. You stand barefoot on a platform that can move in several directions. You wear a safety harness and your doctor watches how you respond when the platform moves. Video head impulse test (vHIT). This uses video images to see how well you can focus on a point when your head is moved suddenly. Electrocochleography. This measures the fluid pressure in your inner ear. To help rule out other conditions, your doctor may do a few other tests, such as: Lab tests Imaging scans, such as CT or MRI scans with contrast"", ""Meniere’s Disease Treatments No treatment can cure Meniere's disease, but your symptoms may get better with treatment. Your doctor will likely start with noninvasive treatments with the fewest side effects first and then proceed to more invasive treatments if you still have symptoms. Your doctor may suggest any of the following: Lifestyle changes. A diet that cuts down on your sodium may help prevent vertigo attacks because it helps lower the fluid volume and pressure in your inner ear. Also, try to avoid red wine, bananas, chocolate, caffeine, yogurt, nuts, smoked meats, candy, jelly, soda, and sugar substitutes such as aspartame. Make sure to drink plenty of water every day, and eat a healthy diet with lots of fresh fruits and vegetables, especially dark, leafy greens. Medicines for vertigo. Vertigo is probably the most serious symptom of Meniere's disease because it can interrupt your daily life and put you in danger of injury from falling. So, your doctor will usually treat this symptom with medicine to treat dizziness or vertigo, such as: Anti-nausea medicines, such as hyoscine (Scopolamine), ondansetron (Zofran), and prochlorperazine (Compazine) Anti-vertigo medicines, such as betahistine (Serc) Diuretic medicines (water pills) to decrease your inner ear fluid volume, such as hydrochlorothiazide (Dyazide) and triamterene Motion sickness medicines, such as diazepam (Valium), meclizine (Antivert), and lorazepam (Ativan)"", ""Other therapies. In addition to medication, you might try therapy targeted to help with your balance issues, such as: Pressure pulse treatment. This approach uses a device to apply pressure to your ear canal through a tube, which improves how fluid moves through your ear. Vestibular rehabilitation therapy . This program retrains your brain to use other senses, such as your vision, to help with balance. Counseling and psychological therapy . Meniere's disease can be challenging to face, and many people who have it also have anxiety and depression. Counselors and therapists can help you find strategies to reduce some of your stress and manage your symptoms. Middle ear injections. Your doctor can inject a couple of drugs into your ear to ease your vertigo symptoms. Your doctors might choose an antibiotic called gentamicin ( Garamycin , Gentak), which is toxic to the organs in your inner ear. It reduces the function of the affected ear so that your “good” ear takes over your balance. This procedure is done in a doctor’s office, where you’ll be given something to numb the pain before the injection. Or your doctor might inject a steroid, which will bring down swelling and help keep the fluid moving in your ear."", ""Surgery. If you have tried other treatments and they haven't helped, your doctor may recommend surgery options, such as: Labyrinthectomy. Your surgeon destroys the parts of the ear that control balance.

Rest during and after attacks. Don't rush to get back to your day-to-day activities. Allow yourself to slowly get up and move around when you feel better to help your brain adjust the signals from your inner ear. Prepare yourself before it happens. Talk to your doctor about what you should do when you get an attack. For instance, talk to your doctor about medicines for dizziness and ask how you can prevent falls and injuries. Several things can trigger vertigo attacks. If you know what triggers your attacks, you can try to avoid them. Try to write down as many things as you can remember about your episodes. Your triggers may include: Moving around, especially quickly. For instance, standing up too quickly can set off a vertigo attack. Turning or tilting your head (especially if you tilt it backward) can also set off your vertigo. Bending over. Bend at your knees if you need to pick something up off the ground instead of just reaching downward.

32,Healthy Eating Habits for Your Child,"[""By teaching your children healthy eating habits, and modeling these behaviors in yourself, you can help your children maintain a healthy weight and normal growth. Also, the eating habits your children pick up when they are young will help them maintain a healthy lifestyle when they are adults. Your child's health care provider can evaluate your child's weight, height and explain their BMI and let you know if your child needs to lose or gain weight or if any dietary changes need to be made. Some of the most important aspects of healthy eating are portion control and cutting down on how much fat and sugar your child eats or drinks. Simple ways to reduce fat intake in your child's diet and promote a healthy weight include serving: Low-fat or nonfat dairy products Poultry without skin Lean cuts of meats Whole grain breads and cereals Healthy snacks such as fruit and veggies Also, reduce the amount of sugar sweetened drinks and salt in your child's diet."", ""If you are unsure about how to select and prepare a variety of foods for your family, consult a registered dietitian for nutrition counseling. It is important that you do not place your overweight child(ren) on a restrictive diet. Children should never be placed on a restrictive diet to lose weight unless a doctor supervises one for medical reasons. Other approaches parents can take to develop healthy eating habits in their children include: Guide your family's choices rather than dictate foods. Make a wide variety of healthful foods available in the house. This practice will help your children learn how to make healthy food choices. Leave the unhealthy choices like chips, soda, and juice at the grocery store. Serve water with meals. Encourage your children to eat slowly. A child can detect hunger and fullness better when they eat slowly. Before offering a second helping or serving, ask your child to wait at least 15 minutes to see if they are truly still hungry . This will give the brain time to register fullness. Also, that second helping should be much smaller than the first.\xa0And if possible, load that second helping with more veggies Eat meals together as a family as often as possible. Try to make mealtimes pleasant with conversation and sharing, not a time for scolding or arguing. If mealtimes are unpleasant, children may try to eat faster to leave the table as soon as possible. They then may learn to associate eating with stress. Involve your children in food shopping and preparing meals. These activities will give you hints about your children's food preferences, an opportunity to teach your children about nutrition , and provide your kids with a feeling of accomplishment. In addition, children may be more willing to eat or try foods that they help prepare. Plan for snacks. Continuous snacking may lead to overeating, but snacks that are planned at specific times during the day can be part of a nutritious diet, without spoiling a child's appetite at meal times. You should make snacks as nutritious as possible, without depriving your children of occasional chips or cookies, especially at parties or other social events. Have healthy snacks\xa0within reach and at eye level. Set some familiy goals. Perhaps restricting desserts to weekends and only having sodas on weekends. Making sure water bottles are empty before dinner time. to encourage hydration Discourage eating meals or snacks while watching TV. Try to eat only in designated areas of your home, such as the dining room or kitchen. Eating in front of the TV may make it difficult to pay attention to feelings of fullness, and may lead to overeating. Encourage your children to drink more water. Overconsumption of sweetened drinks and sodas has been linked to increased rates of obesity in children. Try not to use food to punish or reward your children. Withholding food as a punishment may lead children to worry that they will not get enough food. For example, sending children to bed without any dinner may cause them to worry that they will go hungry . As a result, children may try to eat whenever they get a chance. Similarly, when foods, such as sweets, are used as a reward, children may assume that these foods are better or more valuable than other foods. For example, telling children that they will get dessert if they eat all of their vegetables sends the wrong message about vegetables. Make sure your children's meals outside the home are balanced. Find out more about their school lunch program, or pack their lunch to include a variety of foods. Also, select healthier items when dining at restaurants. Pay attention to portion size and ingredients. Read food labels and limit foods with trans fat . Also, make sure you serve the appropriate portion as indicated on the label.""]"
33,Chronic Kidney Disease,"['If you have chronic kidney disease (CKD), it’s important to watch what you eat and drink. That’s because your kidneys can’t remove waste products and fluid from your body the way they should. A kidney-friendly diet can help you stay healthier longer.', 'What’s a Kidney-Friendly Diet? A major function of the kidneys is to get rid of waste and extra fluid from your body through your pee. They also: Balance your body’s minerals , like salt and potassium Balance your body’s fluids Make hormones that affect the way other organs work A kidney-friendly diet is a way of eating that helps protect your kidneys from further damage. You’ll have to limit some foods and fluids so other fluids and minerals like electrolytes don’t build up in your body. At the same time, you’ll have to make sure you get the right balance of protein, calories, vitamins , and minerals. If you’re in the early stages of CKD, there may be few, if any, limits on what you can eat. But as your disease gets worse, you’ll have to be more careful about what you put into your body. The doctor may suggest you work with a dietitian to choose foods that are easy on your kidneys. They might recommend:', 'Cut the Sodium This mineral is found naturally in many foods. It’s most common in table salt. Sodium affects your blood pressure . It also helps to maintain the water balance in your body. Healthy kidneys keep sodium levels in check. But if you have CKD, extra sodium and fluids build up in your body. This can cause a number of problems, like swollen ankles , high blood pressure , shortness of breath, and fluid buildup around your heart and lungs . You should aim for less than 2 grams of sodium in your daily diet. Take these simple steps to cut the sodium in your diet: Avoid table salt and high-sodium seasonings (soy sauce, sea salt, garlic salt, etc.). Cook at home -- most fast foods are high in sodium. Try new spices and herbs in place of salt. Stay away from packaged foods, if possible. They tend to be high in sodium. Read the labels when shopping, and choose low-sodium foods. Rinse canned foods (veggies, beans, meats, and fish ) with water before serving.', 'Limit Phosphorus and Calcium You need these minerals to keep your bones healthy and strong. When your kidneys are healthy, they remove the phosphorus you don’t need. But if you have CKD, your phosphorus levels can get too high. This puts you at risk for heart disease . What’s more, your calcium levels begin to drop. To make up for it, your body pulls it from your bones. This can make them weak and easier to break. If you have late-stage CKD, your doctor may advise you to get no more than 1,000 milligrams (mg) of phosphorus mineral each day. You can do this by: Choosing foods with low levels of phosphorus (look for “PHOS” on the label) Eating more fresh fruits and veggies Choosing corn and rice cereals Drinking light-colored sodas Cutting back on meat, poultry, and fish Limiting dairy and processed\xa0foods Foods that are high in calcium also tend to be high in phosphorus. The doctor might suggest you cut back on calcium-rich foods. Dairy foods that are lower in phosphorus include: Brie or Swiss cheese Regular or low- fat cream cheese or sour cream Sherbet The doctor might also tell you to stop taking over-the-counter calcium supplements and suggest a phosphorus binder, a medicine that controls your phosphorus levels.', 'Reduce Your Potassium Intake This mineral helps your nerves and muscles work properly. But when you have CKD, your body can’t filter out extra potassium. When you have too much of it in your blood , it can lead to serious heart problems. Potassium is found in a lot of fruits and veggies, like bananas, potatoes, avocados , oranges , cooked broccoli , raw carrots , greens (except kale ), tomatoes , and melons. These foods can affect potassium levels in your blood. Your doctor will let you know if you need to limit this mineral in your diet. If so, they may recommend you try low-potassium foods, like: Apples and apple juice Cranberries and cranberry juice Strawberries, blueberries, raspberries Plums Pineapples Peaches Cabbage Boiled cauliflower Asparagus Beans (green or wax) Celery Cucumber As your CKD gets worse, you may need to make other changes to your diet. This might involve cutting back on foods that are high in protein , especially animal protein. These include meats, seafood, and dairy products. You may also need extra iron. Talk to your doctor about which iron-rich foods you can eat when you have CKD.', 'DASH Diet DASH stands for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension. It’s a diet rich in fruits, veggies, low-fat dairy products, whole grains , fish, poultry, beans, seeds, and nuts. It’s low in sodium, sugars and sweets, fats, and red meats. Talk to your doctor about it if you have CKD. They’ll let you know if there are certain reasons you shouldn’t try the DASH diet . It isn’t an option if you’re on dialysis .', 'What About Fluids? If you have early-stage CKD, you probably don’t need to cut back on fluids. But if your condition gets worse, your doctor will let you know if you need to limit those, too. To cut back on fluids you can: Avoid salty foods Manage your thirst with sugar -free hard candies, ice chips, or frozen grapes Track your fluid in a journal or with a marked container, and track your weight']"

35,Swallowing Problems,"[""What Is Dysphagia? Dysphagia is when you find it difficult, sometimes impossible, to swallow. Swallowing seems simple, but it's actually pretty complicated. It takes your brain , several nerves and muscles, two muscular valves, and an open, unconstricted esophagus (your swallowing tube) to work just right. When you swallow, food moves through your esophagus and then to the rest of your digestive system. (Photo Credit: Science Photo Library / Getty Images)"", 'Stages of Dysphagia The act of swallowing normally happens in three phases, and dysphagia can occur at any of them. Oropharyngeal dysphagia. In the first phase of swallowing, food or liquid is contained in the mouth by the tongue and palate (oral cavity). This phase is the only one you can control. Pharyngeal dysphagia. The second phase\xa0begins when your brain makes the decision to swallow. At this point, a complex series of reflexes begin. The food is thrust from the oral cavity into the throat (pharynx). At the same time, two other things happen: A muscular valve at the bottom of the pharynx opens, allowing food to enter the esophagus, and other muscles close the airway ( trachea ) to prevent food from entering the airways. This phase takes less than half a second. Esophageal dysphagia. The third phase starts when food enters the esophagus. The esophagus, which is about 9 inches long, is a muscular tube that produces waves of coordinated contractions (called peristalsis). As the esophagus contracts, a muscular valve at the end of the esophagus opens and food is propelled into the stomach. The third phase of swallowing takes 6 to 8 seconds to complete.', ""Dysphagia Causes A wide range of issues can cause dysphagia. These include: Disturbances of the brain such as those caused by Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, or ALS ( amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , or Lou Gehrig's disease) Problems with the oral or pharynx muscle, such as from a stroke Loss of sphincter muscle relaxation (called achalasia) Contractions of the esophagus after swallowing known as diffuse spasms Esophageal stricture, which is when your esophagus narrows, making it difficult for food to pass. This may be caused by GERD ( gastroesophageal reflux disease), which can lead to tumors or scar tissue. Blockage in your throat or esophagus by objects such as food, which is more likely in older people who wear dentures and have trouble chewing An esophageal ring, or narrowing in the lower esophagus Eosinophilic esophagitis, which may be related to a food allergy Frequent heartburn, which can weaken your esophagus when acid backs up into the esophagus Inflammation and scarring of the esophagus caused by radiation therapy for cancer"", ""Dysphagia Complications The most common complication of dysphagia is choking or coughing when you can't swallow food correctly and your airways are blocked.

36,Muscular Dystrophy,"['What Is Muscular Dystrophy? Muscular dystrophy (MD) is a group of inherited diseases in which the muscles that control movement (called voluntary muscles) progressively weaken. In some forms of this disease, the heart and other organs are also affected. There are nine major forms of muscular dystrophy: Myotonic Duchenne Becker Limb-girdle Facioscapulohumeral Congenital Oculopharyngeal Distal Emery-Dreifuss Muscular dystrophy can appear in infancy up to middle age or later, and its form and severity are determined in part by the age at which it occurs. Some types of muscular dystrophy typicallyaffect only males; some people with MD enjoy a normal life span with mild symptoms that progress very slowly; others experience swift and severe muscle weakness and wasting, dying in their late teens to early 20s. The various types of MD affect more than 50,000 Americans. Through advances in medical care, children with muscular dystrophy are living longer than ever before.', ""Muscular Dystrophy Symptoms by Type Myotonic (also called MMD or Steinert's disease). The most common form of muscular dystrophy in adults, myotonic muscular dystrophy affects both men and women, and it usually appears any time from early childhood to adulthood. In rare cases, it appears in newborns (congenital MMD). The name refers to a symptom, myotonia -- prolonged spasm or stiffening of muscles after use. This symptom is usually worse in cold temperatures. The disease causes muscle weakness and also affects the central nervous system , heart , gastrointestinal tract, eyes , and hormone-producing glands. In most cases, daily living isn't restricted for many years. Those with myotonic MD have a decreased life expectancy. Duchenne. The most common form of muscular dystrophy in children, Duchenne muscular dystrophy typically affects only males. It appears between the ages of 2 and 6. The muscles decrease in size and grow weaker over time yet may appear larger. Disease progression varies, but many people with Duchenne (1 in 3,500 boys) need a wheelchair by the age of 12. In most cases, the arms, legs, and spine become progressively deformed, and there may be some cognitive impairment. Severe breathing and heart problems mark the later stages of the disease. Those with Duchenne MD usually die in their late teens or early 20s. Becker. This form is similar to Duchenne muscular dystrophy, but the disease is much milder: symptoms appear later and progress more slowly. It usually appears between the ages of 2 and 16 but can appear as late as age 25. Like Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Becker muscular dystrophy typically affects only males (1 in 30,000) and causes heart problems. Disease severity varies. Those with Becker can usually walk into their 30s and live further into adulthood. Limb-girdle. This appears in the teens to early adulthood and affects males and females. In its most common form, Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy causes progressive weakness that begins in the hips and moves to the shoulders, arms, and legs and the heart may be affected. Within 20 years, walking becomes difficult or impossible. Sufferers typically live to middle age to late adulthood. Facioscapulohumeral. Facioscapulohumeral refers to the muscles that move the face, shoulder blade, and upper arm bone . This form of muscular dystrophy appears in the teens to early adulthood and affects males and females. It progresses slowly, with short periods of rapid muscle deterioration and weakness. Severity ranges from very mild to completely disabling. Walking, chewing, swallowing, and speaking problems can occur. About 50% of those with facioscapulohumeral MD can walk throughout their lives, and most live a normal life span. It may also bee associated with seizures, mental health problems, and can involve the heart Congenital. Congenital means present at birth. Congenital muscular dystrophies progress slowly and affect males and females. The two forms that have been identified -- Fukuyama and congenital muscular dystrophy with myosin deficiency -- cause muscle weakness at birth or in the first few months of life, along with severe and early contractures (shortening or shrinking of muscles that causes joint problems). Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy causes abnormalities in the brain and often seizures . Oculopharyngeal. Oculopharyngeal means eye and throat. This form of muscular dystrophy appears in men and women in their 40s, 50s, and 60s. It progresses slowly, causing weakness in the eye and face muscles, which may lead to difficulty swallowing. Weakness in pelvic and shoulder muscles may occur later. Choking and recurrent pneumonia may occur. Distal. This group of rare diseases affects adult men and women. It causes weakness and wasting of the distal muscles (those farthest from the center) of the forearms, hands, lower legs, and feet . It is generally less severe, progresses more slowly, and affects fewer muscles than other forms of muscular dystrophy. Emery-Dreifuss. This rare form of muscular dystrophy appears from childhood to the early teens and affects mainly males. In very rare cases, females can be affected. For that to happen, both of a girls X chromosomes (the one they get from their mother and the one from their father) would have to have the defective gene. It causes muscle weakness and wasting in the shoulders, upper arms, and lower legs. Life-threatening heart problems are common and can also affect carriers -- those who have the genetic information for the disease but do not develop the full-blown version (including mothers and sisters of those with Emery-Dreifuss MD). Muscle shortening (contractures) occurs early in the disease. Weakness can spread to chest and pelvic muscles. The disease progresses slowly and causes less severe muscle weakness than some other forms of muscular dystrophy."", ""Muscular Dystrophy Causes and Risk Factors Muscular dystrophy is caused by defects in certain genes, with type determined by the abnormal gene. In 1986, researchers discovered the gene that, when defective or flawed, causes Duchenne muscular dystrophy. In 1987, the muscle protein associated with this gene was named dystrophin. Duchenne muscular dystrophy occurs when that gene fails to make dystrophin. Becker muscular dystrophy occurs when a different mutation in the same gene results in some dystrophin, but it's either not enough or it's poor in quality. Scientists have discovered and continue to search for the genetic defects that cause other forms of muscular dystrophy."", ""Most of the muscular dystrophies are a form of inherited disease called X-linked disorders or genetic diseases that mothers can transmit to their sons even though the mothers themselves are unaffected by the disease. Men carry one X chromosome and one Y chromosome. Females carry two X chromosomes. Thus, in order for a girl to become affected by muscular dystrophy, both their X chromosomes would have to carry the defective gene -- an extremely rare occurrence, since their mother would have to be a carrier (one defective X chromosome) and their father would have to have muscular dystrophy (since men carry just one X chromosome, the other is a Y chromosome). A female who carries the defective X chromosome can pass the disease to their son (whose other chromosome is a Y, from the father). A few muscular dystrophies aren't inherited at all and occur because of a new gene abnormality or mutation."", 'Muscular Dystrophy Diagnosis To start, your doctor will examine your child and ask questions about medical and family health history. Muscular dystrophy is diagnosed using several different tests. These may include:', 'Muscle biopsy . A small piece of muscle tissue is removed and examined to confirm the diagnosis or rule out another muscle disease. Genetic ( DNA ) testing. Genes passed down through families can cause some forms of muscular dystrophy. A blood test can determine if you or your child has the gene. Neurological tests. Various tests are done to check nervous system function, reflexes, and coordination. One example is a nerve conduction study, also called a nerve function test, or electromyography (EMG).', 'Enzyme tests. These are blood tests that check for proteins, or enzymes, linked to muscle weakness. People with muscular dystrophy have high levels of the enzyme creatine kinase. It’s made when muscles are damaged. They also have higher levels of serum aldolase, which is made when your body breaks down sugar into energy. Heart monitoring. An electrocardiogram may be done to check for an abnormal heartbeat . Some types of muscular dystrophy cause irregular heartbeats. MRI or ultrasound . These imaging tests give the doctor a look at muscle quality and can reveal if fat is replacing muscle tissue.', 'Muscular Dystrophy Treatment There is no cure for muscular dystrophy, but treatments can help manage symptoms and improve quality of life. Medications Prescription drugs are available to control muscular dystrophy symptoms or slow their progression. Medications for muscular dystrophy include: Steroids . Corticosteroids, such as prednisone and deflazacort (Emflaza), are the standard of care for muscular dystrophy. They help improve muscle strength and breathing and decrease weakness. Side effects include high blood pressure and weight gain . People who use steroids for a long time are at risk for brittle bones. Medicines targeting gene mutations. Eteplirsen (Exondys 51) and golodirsen (Vyondys 53) increase the level of the gene dystrophin. They’re approved to specifically treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Anticonvulsants. Often used to treat epilepsy , these antiseizure drugs may also help reduce muscle spasms . Immunosuppressants. These powerful medicines are often used to treat lupus and other autoimmune diseases . When given to people with muscular dystrophy, they may help prevent some muscle cell damage. Antibiotics. The doctor may prescribe an antibiotic to treat a lung infection, which is common in people with muscular dystrophy.', 'Physical therapy Physical therapy helps keep joints and muscles flexible. It’s an important part of a muscular dystrophy treatment plan. The goal of physical therapy is to improve strength in the large muscle groups and prevent scoliosis and contractures. Physical therapy for muscular dystrophy may involve: Range of motion exercises Stretching Low-impact workouts, such as swimming or water exercise (aquatic therapy)', 'Respiratory care Muscle weakness can affect the lungs, making breathing difficult. A respiratory therapist can teach you and your child how to properly use a mask, nose device, or mouthpiece. Mobility and positioning aids Braces, walkers, or wheelchairs help provide mobility and independence to people with muscular dystrophy. Standing with a walker, even for just a little bit each day, boosts blood flow and helps build better bones. Speech therapy Muscle weakness in the face and throat can make speaking difficult. Learning how to properly pace breathing and talking can be helpful. A speech therapist can also show you how to use speech communication devices.', 'Surgery Surgery may be recommended to manage or correct complications of muscular dystrophy. For example, cataract surgery may be done to replace a cloudy eye lens. Or a person with muscular dystrophy may need spinal fusion surgery to treat scoliosis, or heart surgery to implant a pacemaker .', 'Muscular Dystrophy Complications The complications of muscular dystrophy depend on the type. Some types are mild, while others are serious and get worse very fast. Worsening muscle weakness can affect the ability to walk, breathe, swallow, and speak. Complications of muscular dystrophy can include: Breathing problems . Progressive weakness in the breathing muscles (diaphragm) makes it hard to take a breath. That raises the risk for lung infections such as pneumonia. Curving of the spine (scoliosis). Weakness in the muscles supporting the backbone causes the spine to become curved. Most people with Duchenne muscular dystrophy need scoliosis surgery. Heart problems. Some types of muscular dystrophy cause abnormal and dangerous changes in the heartbeat. You need a pacemaker to regulate it. Muscular dystrophy can also cause the heart muscle to become weak ( cardiomyopathy ). That leads to heart failure .', 'Swallowing difficulty. Weakness affects the muscles in the esophagus , and causes problems with chewing and swallowing. This can lead to choking. Some people with muscular dystrophy will need a feeding tube . Shortening of the tendons or muscles around the joints (contractures). Bracing and tendon release surgery can help prevent some contractures. Vision problems. Some types of muscular dystrophy cause clouding of the eye lens ( cataracts ). Need for a wheelchair. Weakness in the large muscles of the legs makes it difficult to walk, stand, kneel, or climb. Some people with muscular dystrophy eventually need to use a wheelchair.']"
37,Tips for a Successful Doctor Visit,"['No matter how much you love your doctor, it’s likely that once you don that gaping gown and hop on the exam table, you hope for a visit that’s as quick and easy as possible. Though some things like wait times and exam wear may be out of your control, there are a few things you can do to help your time at the doc go smoothly.', ""Know Your Goal Set yourself up for success early in the game: Be clear about why you’re coming and what will happen at the visit. It starts when you call to make your appointment. “In a doctor's mind, there's a very significant difference between a well visit, which is preventative, and a problem visit,” says Viviana Martinez-Bianchi, MD, the family medicine residency program director at the Duke\xa0Department of Community and Family Medicine. Not only are the two billed differently (depending on your insurance, a well visit may be free, while a problem visit typically comes with a co-pay), but they also take up different amounts of your doctor’s schedule."", ""When you call the scheduler, ask: How much time will the doctor have to see me? Should I not eat or drink before I come? Am I due for lab work? “If you call and tell the receptionist you have a sore throat, usually you're going to be in a 10-15-minute time slot,” says John Meigs Jr., MD, board chair of the American Academy of Family Physicians. “But if you come in with 14 other complaints, you’ll leave feeling like you didn’t get everything out of me that you came for, and we’ll both leave frustrated.”"", 'Know Your Role You’re the expert on you. But your doctor is also an expert -- one who trained for many years in medicine. Be an advocate for yourself, but also listen. “People sometimes want to give you their diagnosis instead of their symptoms,” Meigs says. It’s OK to clarify and raise concerns you have, but demanding certain tests or medicines may hold up treatments that could really help you.', ""“It’s give and take,” says Russ Blackwelder, MD, assistant professor at the Medical University of South Carolina. “Don't dominate your visits, and don't let your physician dominate your visits.” He says if you don’t feel like you’re an active part of your visits, that may be a sign you need a different doctor. “If your provider is doing all the talking, then just prescribing medicine without taking time to listen, that’s a red flag.” Don't be afraid to make a change and see someone who’s a better fit for you."", 'Get Familiar With Your Family Tree Does diabetes run in your family? How about high blood pressure? Rheumatoid arthritis? Other chronic conditions? If you don’t know, it’s time to ask around. It’s most important to know the health histories of your direct family members, but grandparents and others may also come into play, Martinez-Bianchi says. Ask your doctor for a list of conditions to research in your family’s past, then write down the answers and bring them with you to your visit.', 'If your family tends to be private about its health, you may have to have a few awkward conversations. If they’re more open, start paying attention. “Some families get together for Thanksgiving dinner and everybody talks about their medical problems over turkey,” Meigs says. If that’s the case, take notes -- it’s for your health!', ""Have Meds on Hand Your doctor needs to know which medications you’re taking, including any over-the-counter meds and supplements. It'll help uncover possible interactions or side effects, and a snapshot of the types of treatments you’ve already got going in your system. And your best guess won’t cut it. “Don't just tell me you take the little blue pill and the little white pill,” Meigs says. His tip: Bring your medications with you to your appointment. Don’t want to tote a bag full of pills in public? Take a picture of your prescription bottles with your smartphone. That way, your doctor will have all the info they need in a quick glance, including dosage and whether you’re due for a refill."", ""Let Your Guard Down Honesty is the best policy, and there’s nowhere that’s truer than with your doctor. “When the exam room door closes, we want to know people as they really are,” Blackwelder says. In order for that to happen, you have to let go of any awkwardness you feel and tell your doctor your whole health story. “Trust me, whatever you tell me, I've heard worse,” Meigs says. “People are people. I'm just here to help.” Opening up about symptoms and conditions can be hard for some cultures or after certain experiences, Martinez-Bianchi says. But it’s an important -- sometimes life-saving -- barrier to push past. “I’ve had [folks] who knew they had HIV but didn't tell me, and so years of treatment were lost. HIV is a controllable condition, not a death sentence -- but only if you get the appropriate treatment.” Bottom line: A good doctor will never think less of you because of the conditions you have. Being up front will help you get the care you need and deserve. “We became physicians because we want to help,” Blackwelder says. “Don't be afraid to let us try.”""]"
38,Heart Disease and High Blood Pressure,"['High blood pressure, also called hypertension , is a major risk factor for heart disease, kidney disease , stroke, and heart failure.', 'What Blood Pressure Is Considered Too High? A blood pressure of 130/80 or higher is considered high. This is called hypertension A blood pressure between 120 and 129 and\xa0less than 80\xa0is considered elevated. This means that you do not have hypertension , but you may develop it in the future unless you adopt lifestyle changes to keep your blood pressure under control.', 'How Can I Prevent High Blood Pressure? You can prevent high blood pressure by: Maintaining a healthy weight; lose weight if you are overweight. Exercising more Eating foods low in salt Eating healthy foods like fruits and vegetables Drinking alcoholic beverages in moderation, if you drink at all These changes are also recommended for treating high blood pressure , although medicine is often added as part of the treatment.', 'How Is Blood Pressure Related to Weight? As your body weight increases, your blood pressure can rise. In fact, being overweight can make you more likely to develop high blood pressure than if you are at your desirable weight. About 70% of adults in the United States are overweight. You can reduce your risk of high blood pressure by losing weight. Even small amounts of weight loss can make a big difference in helping to prevent and treat high blood pressure.', ""How Can I Lose Weight? To lose weight, you need to eat fewer calories than you burn. But don't go on a crash diet to see how quickly you can lose those pounds. The healthiest and longest-lasting weight loss happens when you do it slowly, losing 1/2 to 1 pound a week. By cutting back by 500 calories/day, by eating less and being more physically active , you can lose about one pound in a week. Here are some tips to help you lose weight and get on the road to healthy eating : Choose foods high in fiber. Foods high in fiber include fruits, vegetables, dry peas, and beans, as well as whole-grain (as opposed to highly processed) cereals, pasta, rice, and breads. They are low-calorie and are good sources of vitamins and minerals. Choose whole-wheat vs. processed starches . Not all starches are equal. In general, you should choose whole-grain instead of processed starches. One guideline is to avoid starchy foods that are predominantly white in color - for example, white bread, potatoes, pasta, or rice. Whole-grain foods have higher nutritional value and generally leave you feeling fuller, which will also help prevent you from overeating. Limit serving size. To lose weight, it's not just the type of foods you eat that's important, but also the amount. To take in fewer calories, you need to limit your portion sizes . Try especially to take smaller helpings of high-calorie foods like higher-fat meats and cheeses. And try not to go back for seconds. Keep a food diary. Write down what you eat, when you eat and why. Note whether you snack on high-fat foods in front of the television, or if you skip breakfast and then eat a large lunch. Once you see your habits, you can set goals for yourself. Exercise . Another important ingredient to losing weight is increasing physical activity. Cutting down on calories and getting regular physical activity can help you lose more weight and keep it off longer than only eating less or only exercising. Exercise can also lower blood pressure. People who are physically active have a lower risk of getting high blood pressure than people who are not active. You don't have to be a marathon runner to benefit from physical activity. Even light activities, if done daily, can help lower your risk of heart disease . Take the stairs instead of the elevator, or park farther away from the entrance so that you have to walk farther."", 'How Can I Reduce My Intake of Salt? Americans eat more salt and other forms of sodium than they need. Often, when people with high blood pressure cut back on salt, their blood pressure falls. Cutting back on salt also prevents blood pressure from rising. Some people, like African-Americans and the elderly, may be more affected by sodium than others. Since there\'s really no practical way to predict exactly who will be affected by sodium, it makes sense for everyone to limit intake of salt to help prevent high blood pressure. All Americans, especially people with high blood pressure, should eat less than 2,300 milligrams of sodium daily. That\'s about 1 teaspoon of table salt. But remember to keep track of ALL salt eaten -- including that in processed foods and salt added during cooking or at the table. You can teach your taste buds to enjoy less salty foods. Here are a few tips: Check food labels for the amount of salt in foods. Choose those lower in sodium most of the time. Look for products that say ""sodium free,"" ""very low sodium ,"" "" low sodium ,"" ""light in sodium,"" ""reduced or less sodium"" or ""unsalted,"" especially on cans, boxes, bottles, and bags. Buy foods that are fresh, plain frozen, or canned with ""no salt added. "" Use fresh poultry, fish and lean meat, rather than canned or processed types. Use herbs, spices, and salt-free seasoning blends in cooking instead of salt. Cook rice, pasta and hot cereals without salt. Cut back on instant or flavored rice, pasta, and cereal mixes, because they usually have added salt. Rinse canned foods like tuna to remove some sodium. A research study called the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) showed that you can reduce your blood pressure by eating foods rich in grains, fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products.', 'How Much Alcohol Can I Drink if I Have High Blood Pressure? Drinking too much alcohol can raise your blood pressure. It may also lead to the development of high blood pressure. So to help prevent high blood pressure, if you drink alcohol, limit how much you drink to no more than two drinks a day if you are male. The ""Dietary Guidelines for Americans"" recommend that for overall health, women and lighter weight persons should limit their alcohol to no more than one drink a day.', 'This is what counts as a drink: 1 1/2 ounces of 80-proof or 1 ounce of 100-proof whiskey 5 ounces of wine 12 ounces of beer (regular or light) You may have heard that some alcohol is good for your heart . Some studies suggest that people who consume a drink or two a day have lower blood pressure and live longer than those who consume excessive amounts of alcohol or no alcohol at all. Others note that wine raises the ""good"" (HDL) blood cholesterol that prevents the build-up of fats in the arteries . While these studies may be correct, they don\'t tell the whole story. Too much alcohol contributes to a host of other health problems, such as motor vehicle accidents, diseases of the liver and pancreas , damage to the brain and heart , an increased risk of many cancers, and fetal alcohol syndrome . Alcohol is also high in calories. So you should limit how much you drink.', 'Can Caffeine Affect my Blood Pressure? The caffeine in drinks like coffee, tea, and sodas may cause blood pressure to go up, but only temporarily. In a short time your blood pressure will go back down. Unless you are sensitive to caffeine and your blood pressure does not go down, you do not have to limit caffeine to avoid developing high blood pressure.', 'Can Stress Affect Blood Pressure? Yes. Stress can make blood pressure go up for a while and over time may contribute to the cause of high blood pressure. There are many steps you can take to reduce your stress. The article on easing stress will get you started.', 'What About High Blood Pressure Drugs? If you have high blood pressure, the lifestyle changes mentioned above may not be enough to lower your pressure. Your doctor may recommend adding medication .

39,What Is Domestic Abuse?,"['Domestic abuse is more than just hitting, shoving, and other physical attacks. It’s a pattern of controlling behaviors. The goal always is to get and keep power over an intimate partner. You may not realize you’re in an abusive relationship. Not even if you’re the abuser. Abuse can happen to anyone, anywhere. It happens to married, unmarried, and same-sex couples. Abusers and their partners can be rich or poor, and come from any race and ethnicity. Men can abuse women. Women can abuse men. You may think the troubles in your relationship are no big deal. Your partner slaps you only during huge fights. Or insults you only after a bad day at work. It all counts as domestic abuse. And chances are it will only get worse as time passes.', 'Types Domestic abuse is any behavior that scares, intimidates, humiliates, isolates, and controls another person. This can happen in any type of relationship. It can affect married, engaged, dating, straight, LGBTQ+, young, or old people. People in all religions, socioeconomic backgrounds, and education levels can be in an abusive relationship.', 'Physical violence . The abuser may: Hit Grab hair Shove Bite Force drugs or alcohol Deny medical care Sexual abuse. It’s a type of physical abuse. Anytime you feel forced into any sexual act you don’t want, because you’re not in the mood or for any other reason, that’s sexual abuse. Emotional or psychological abuse. This can be verbal or nonverbal. The aim is to lower your sense of self-worth and chip away your independence. Your partner may: Call you names or yell at you Shame you Blame you Constantly criticize Damage your relationship with others and isolate you Threaten to hurt you, themselves, or others Hurt your pets, children, or destroy property Economic abuse. This isn’t about one person managing the household finances. It’s when the abuser keeps their partner financially dependent by controlling the money. They also may not allow you to have a job or attend school.', 'Abuse in Certain Groups Many abusers act alike. But sometimes, the abuse can take specific forms.', 'LGBTQ people: Abusers may go after their partners’ sexual identity. They may threaten to “out” their partners or accuse them of not really being gay, bi, or trans -- which can not only demean the abused person but also isolate them from the community. Immigrants: People who are here legally or illegally can have a hard time getting help. Their abusers may: Keep them from learning English Block them from staying in touch with family and friends in their native countries Use the threat of deportation as a tool of control Disabled people: They are especially vulnerable to domestic violence , including sexual assault. Their abusers may: Steal their Social Security disability payments Damage wheelchairs or other assistive equipment Harm or threaten to harm a service dog or other animal Refuse to help them use the bathroom or do other needed tasks Pregnant women: The abuse can start or get worse as the woman shifts some of their focus away from their partner to their unborn baby . Physical violence also can raise the woman’s chances of miscarriage or complications during labor .', 'Is Mutual Abuse a Real Thing? Mutual abuse doesn’t exist. While there may be harmful behaviors from both sides of the relationship, abuse happens when one person holds more control over the other. You may find that you and your partner get in fights a lot, purposely hurt each other’s feelings, or you may hurt your partner back out of self-defense. Your partner may use these moments to try to convince you that you’re abusive, too. But a relationship can’t be mutually abusive. This is because it’s impossible for both partners to have the same amount of control over each other at the same time. An abusive partner may try to shift blame and say things like: “You hit me, too.” “What you said made me act that way toward you.” “You started this.” If your partner “blame shifts,” it means that they claim you’re equally or more responsible for an abusive situation. Their goal is to manipulate you to believe that you did something to deserve abusive treatment. If you think you’re at fault, it’s easier for your abuser to have control over you.', 'It’s important to remember that self-defense and violent resistance are different from abuse. If you’ve yelled at, argued with, or used physical force against your partner to protect yourself, this is not abuse. Over time, abuse can lead to: Low self-esteem Low self-worth Emotional stress Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) You may feel the need to get violent or yell back at your partner when you feel your safety is at risk. While this isn’t healthy, it may be a self-defense tactic to attempt to maintain your independence. Although an abusive partner may say otherwise, self-defense isn’t abuse.', 'If You’re Abused The abused person is never at fault. Fights and arguments happen in every relationship. But a pattern of abusive words and behavior is not normal and it’s not OK. If you think you’re being abused, consider reaching out to an advocate who can help support you.

Stay near a door so that you can escape quickly. Pack a suitcase of essential clothing, medications, important documents, money, keys, emergency phone numbers, or other things. Keep this hidden from your partner but accessible to you if you need to leave suddenly. Keep a list of important contacts (such as local shelters, safe friends/family, other resources). Tell trusted neighbors about the abuse and ask them to stop by, call your home, or call a third party (like a friend/family member or the police if you’d prefer) if they hear noise from your home.

40,What Is Epidermolysis Bullosa?,"['Epidermolysis bullosa is a rare genetic condition that makes skin so fragile that it can tear or blister at the slightest touch. Children born with it are often called “Butterfly Children” because their skin seems as fragile as a butterfly wing. Mild forms may get better with time. But severe cases can be painful, trigger other serious health issues, and can be life-threatening. If you have this condition, you need special treatment to keep your delicate skin as healthy as possible.', 'Types There are five major types of epidermolysis bullosa. The kind you have depends on where your blisters tend to form. Epidermolysis Bullosa Simplex: The most common type, it first shows up in newborns. It mainly affects the palms of the hands and soles of the feet . Junctional epidermolysis bullosa : While it also first appears in babies, this is a more severe form that causes blistering in deep layers of the skin. Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa: If you have this type, your skin doesn’t have collagen to hold it together, or the collagen you do have doesn’t work well. This means the layers of your skin don’t seal together like they should. Sometimes this type doesn’t show up until early childhood.', 'Kindler syndrome: This is a mixed condition since blisters appear across different skin layers. It can also cause patchy changes in your skin coloring when it’s exposed to the sun. Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita: This form causes blisters on your hands and feet as well as in mucous membranes like the mouth .', 'Causes Almost all types of epidermolysis bullosa run in families. If you inherited certain gene glitches from your parents, you will have it. There’s one exception. Epidermolysis bullosa aquisita is the only type that’s not inherited. It happens because of a problem in your immune system .', 'Symptoms Usually, signs of epidermolysis bullosa first appear in babies or toddlers . Painful skin blisters are the main symptom. They can form anywhere on the skin. Sometimes they also form on the eyes , or in parts of the throat, stomach , or bladder . If these blisters become infected or scar the skin, they cause more problems.', 'Diagnosis To confirm the condition, your doctor may take a small sample of skin and send it to a lab where experts will use a microscope to look at it.', 'Treatment There’s no cure for epidermolysis bullosa. But there are treatments for it. If you have a severe case, you’ll care for your skin much like someone who has a burn does. You’ll need to learn how to perform daily wound treatment and how to bandage and protect affected areas. Your doctor can also prescribe a medicine to help with pain relief. In some cases, you might need surgery. If you have blisters that have fused your fingers and toes together, your doctor can separate them. Or if your esophagus , the tube connecting your mouth to your stomach , becomes too scarred, you can get surgery to widen it to help you eat. Some people with epidermolysis bullosa still find eating too painful. In that case, your doctor may suggest a feeding tube so food goes right into your stomach.', 'Tips for At-Home Care To help prevent blisters, you have to take special care of your skin. Reduce friction. Use lotion to keep your skin moist and reduce friction. If you cover wounds, use only dressings that aren’t sticky, then loosely wrap again with rolled gauze. Wear loose-fitting clothes without tags, tight sleeves, or seams.', 'Drain blisters. If left untreated, these can fill with fluid and become infected. Your doctor can show you the best way to drain them. Keep cool. Keep your bath water no warmer than room temperature. Stay in air conditioning as much as you can and avoid heat and humidity. Know the signs of infection. Your skin may get red or feel hot to the touch if it is becoming infected. You could also notice pus or a yellow discharge crusting at the site, a red streak under the skin, or have fever or chills. If you see any of these signs, call your doctor right away. You may need antibiotics . Check your diet . Many people with epidermolysis bullosa have low levels of iron, selenium , or vitamin D . Your doctor may suggest that you see a nutritionist about eating more foods that are rich in these vitamins and minerals.', 'Get support. Talk to your doctor or someone you trust.

People with Down syndrome (DS) are born with an extra chromosome. Chromosomes are bundles of genes, and your body relies on having just the right number of them. With Down syndrome, this extra chromosome leads to a range of issues that affect you both mentally and physically. Down syndrome is named after John Langdon Down, an English doctor who was the first person to publish an accurate description of the condition in the 1860s. Children with Down syndrome can go on to lead full and happy lives. (Photo Credit: iStock/Getty Images) Down syndrome is a lifelong condition. Although it can’t be cured, doctors know more about it now than ever. If your child has it, getting the right care early on can make a big difference in helping them live a full and meaningful life. How many people have Down syndrome? No one knows for sure. It could be as high as 6 million people worldwide, according to the Global Down Syndrome Foundation. The CDC estimated there were around 250,700 children, teens, and adults living with Down syndrome in the U.S. in 2008. It also said 1 in every 700 babies in the U.S. are born with Down syndrome. This makes it the most common chromosomal condition in America.', ""Down syndrome vs. autism There are some similarities and differences between the two conditions. First, we'll look at the differences. Down syndrome : Genetic disorder, usually with physical traits. People with this condition are often social and friendly. Their language development is similar to that of more typical children. Autism: Neurological disorder (dysfunction in the brain and nervous system) with no physical characteristics. People with this condition often prefer to be alone and not socialize. Their language skills might be delayed or not develop. Similarities: Both groups may: Prefer routine Have developmental delays Avoid eye contact Enjoy repetitive play Show challenging behaviors (trouble managing feelings when frustrated, lack of impulse control, etc.) About 18% of children with Down syndrome also have autism, but sometimes children with DS might show these behaviors without having autism."", ""Types of Down Syndrome There are three types of Down syndrome : trisomy 21, translocation Down syndrome, and mosaic Down syndrome. Trisomy 21 This is the most common type of Down syndrome, with 95% of people with DS having trisomy 21. Here, all your body's cells have three copies of chromosome 21 instead of two."", ""Translocation Down syndrome About 3% of people with Down syndrome have this type, where there's an extra part or whole chromosome 21, but it's attached to another chromosome instead of being a separate chromosome 21. Mosaic Down syndrome This type of Down syndrome, which affects about 2% of people with the condition, happens when only some cells in your body have an extra chromosome 21. You can’t tell what type of Down syndrome someone has by how they look. The effects of all three types are very similar, but someone with mosaic Down syndrome may not have as many symptoms because fewer cells have the extra chromosome. So it's possible to have undiagnosed mosaic Down syndrome."", 'Down Syndrome Symptoms Down syndrome can have many effects, and it’s different for each person. Some will grow up to live almost entirely on their own, while others will need more help taking care of themselves. Mental abilities vary, but most people with Down syndrome have mild to moderate issues with thinking, reasoning, and understanding. They’ll learn and pick up new skills their whole lives, but they may take longer to reach important goals like walking, talking, and developing social skills.', 'People with Down syndrome may also have trouble with behavior – they may not pay attention well, or can be obsessive about some things. That’s because it’s harder for them to control their impulses , relate to others, and manage their feelings when they get frustrated. As adults, people with Down syndrome may learn to decide many things on their own but will likely need help with more complex issues, like birth control or managing money. Some may go to a college that can provide accommodations and modifications tailored to developmental and intellectual delays and may go on to live independently, while others will need more day-to-day care.', 'Down syndrome features People with Down syndrome tend to have certain physical features in common. These may include: Eyes that slant up at the outer corner Small ears A flat nose Tongue that sticks out Tiny white spots in the colored part of the eyes Short neck and overall height Small hands and feet Short stature Loose joints Weak muscle tone and joints Small pinky fingers that curve in One crease across the palm of the hand Many people with Down syndrome don’t have any other health issues, but others do. They may have eye diseases , vision problems, hearing loss and ear infections, sleep apnea, and heart problems.', ""What Causes Down Syndrome? For most people, each cell in the body has 23 pairs of chromosomes. One chromosome in each pair comes from your mother and the other comes from your father. But with Down syndrome, you get an extra copy of chromosome 21. That means you have three copies instead of two, which leads to the symptoms of Down syndrome. Doctors aren’t sure why this happens. There’s no link to anything in the environment or anything the parents did or didn’t do. Is Down syndrome genetic? It’s not common, but it's possible to pass Down syndrome from parent to child. Sometimes, a parent has what experts call “translocated” genes. That means some of their genes aren’t in their normal place, perhaps on a different chromosome from where they’d usually be found. The parent doesn’t have Down syndrome because they have the right number of genes, but their child may have translocation Down syndrome, where they have an extra chromosome 21. Not everyone with translocation Down syndrome gets it from their parents – it may also happen by chance."", 'Down Syndrome Risk Factors While doctors don’t know what causes it, they do know that women (or people with female anatomy) ages 35 and older have a higher chance of having a baby with Down syndrome. If you’ve already had a child with Down syndrome, you’re more likely to have another one who also has it. But most babies who have Down syndrome are born to mothers under 35 because most children are born to younger women. Men (or people with male anatomy) over 40 at the time of conception also have an increased risk of having a child with Down, particularly if the mother is also over 35.', 'Down Syndrome Tests Routine tests done during pregnancy can check to see if it’s likely your baby has Down syndrome. If those results are positive, or if you’re at high risk, you may choose to have some more invasive tests to be sure. Prenatal genetic testing Screening tests are usually done first and are considered to pose no risk to you and your growing baby. These normally include a combination of blood tests and ultrasounds, which show images of your baby.', ""In the first trimester , you may have: Blood tests. Your doctor measures the levels of a protein called PAPP-A and a hormone called hCG in your blood. Anything out of the normal range could mean a problem with the baby. Cell-free DNA test . This blood test checks the baby's DNA circulating in your blood via the placenta. It can tell if your unborn baby is at a higher risk of a chromosomal abnormality like Down syndrome or another condition. Ultrasound (nuchal translucency test). Your doctor looks at a picture of your baby and measures the folds of tissue at the back of their neck. The extra tissue is called the nuchal fold. Babies with Down syndrome tend to have extra fluid there. Since this fluid buildup can be due to a number of genetic conditions, this test is usually combined with a blood test. In the second trimester, you may have: Blood tests. Either a triple or quad-screen test measures other substances in your blood, including the protein AFP and the hormone estriol. Those levels, combined with the results from the first-trimester tests, give your doctor a good estimate of the chances your baby has Down syndrome. Ultrasound. When your baby is more developed, an ultrasound can show some of the physical features of Down syndrome. Screening tests don't tell you for certain that your baby has Down syndrome. They only tell you if your baby is at high or low risk for DS. For confirmation, you have to do a diagnostic test. These d iagnostic tests usually happen after screening test results are positive, as they carry a small risk that you could miscarry after having them. They include : Chorionic villus sampling (CVS). This can be done during the first trimester, using cells taken from the placenta. Amniocentesis. Fluid is taken from the amniotic sac surrounding the baby, usually during the second trimester. Percutaneous umbilical blood sampling (PUBS). This is also done in the second trimester using blood removed from the umbilical cord."", 'Down Syndrome Diagnosis After a baby is born, a doctor may suspect Down syndrome in a newborn based on the baby’s appearance. But some babies without DS may have similar physical features to a baby with Down syndrome. A diagnosis can be confirmed by a blood test called a karyotype test that lines up the chromosomes and will show if there’s an extra chromosome 21.', ""Down Syndrome Complications Babies with Down syndrome may be born with other physical problems, and they’re at a higher risk of certain health issues later in life. Possible complications of Down syndrome include: Heart problems. About half of babies with Down syndrome are born with a heart defect that may need surgery. Hearing and vision problems, including crossed eyes and cataracts Gastrointestinal disorders like blockages, reflux, and celiac disease Weight issues Breathing issues, including sleep apnea, asthma, and pulmonary hypertension Underactive thyroid Seizures Childhood leukemia Early-onset dementia They’re also more likely to have: Blood conditions like anemia, where you have low iron. It’s not as common, but they also have a higher chance of getting leukemia, a type of blood cancer. Infections. People with Down syndrome may get sick more often because they tend to have weaker immune systems. As they age, adults with Down syndrome are at a higher risk of depression and Alzheimer's dementia, which are conditions that will also affect their behavior."", 'Treatments for Down Syndrome There’s no specific treatment for Down syndrome. But there is a wide range of physical and developmental therapies designed to help people with Down syndrome reach their full potential. The earlier you start treatment, the better. Children with Down syndrome can usually hit the same milestones as other children but at later stages. So, therapy is key to help children with the disorder meet those milestones. Each child will have different needs. Yours may benefit from: Physical, occupational, and speech therapy. Physical and speech therapists can help your child with sitting and walking properly, developing speech, and learning to communicate. Occupational therapists teach everyday skills like how to get dressed, eat, or use a computer. Behavioral counseling . Children with Down syndrome may also have conditions like ADHD, autism, or compulsive behaviors that need to be addressed. Specialized education services . By law in the U.S., children with Down syndrome can get free educational services and devices to help with learning. This assistance lasts until age 21 or when they finish high school, whichever comes first. Social and recreation activities Programs that offer job training and teach self-care skills', ""You’ll also work closely with your child’s doctor to watch for and manage any health problems that come with the condition. Individualized education program (IEP) This is a legal written document required for each child who needs special educational services in the U.S. The IEP is written by school personnel (teachers, school psychologist, etc.) after meeting with you and setting developmental goals for your child for the year. This also helps you decide whether to place your child in a school for kids with special needs or in one where most of the kids don't have special needs. A new IEP is written each year."", 'Raising a Child With Down Syndrome When your child has Down syndrome, one of the most useful things you can do is learn as much about it as you can. You might search online for programs and resources to help your child. Along the way, talk with other parents whose children have Down syndrome so you can learn tips and find out what to expect. And as your child grows, you can work with doctors, therapists, teachers, and other specialists.', 'Beyond these big-picture tasks, it can help to know what you can do day to day, not only to support your child, but also to take care of yourself. Down syndrome support Every family has their joys, stresses, and challenges, but when you have a child with Down syndrome, things look a little different. Besides juggling school, music lessons, sports, and jobs, you typically have a lot of extra visits with doctors and therapists. Your needs and the needs of your child make it even more important to accept help when it’s offered. Here are a few ideas: Build a support system. Invite your friends and family to take part in caregiving . They can let you have a little time to yourself to walk, read a book, or just zone out for a while. A break, even a small one, can help you be a better parent and partner. Talk about your challenges. People want to help but don’t always know how. A simple, “It’s hard to get a healthy dinner on the table with all these appointments” opens a door and gives them ideas of what they can do. Keep a list of things you need. And don’t be afraid to use it. Next time someone says, “Just let me know how I can help,” you’ll be ready. Find time for friends. Even if it’s just a small moment after the kids go to bed, friends can help you laugh and recharge. Consider therapy. You might think about seeing a therapist. They can help you work through your feelings and give you tools to handle everyday stresses. Take care of your health. Exercise and eat well, even when you feel burned out. Try to make a plan and stick to it as best you can.', 'Everyday tips Like most children, kids with Down syndrome tend to do well with routine. They also respond better to positive support than discipline. Keep both of those things in mind as you try the following daily tips: Give your child chores around the house, but break them up into small steps and be patient. Have your child play with other kids who do and don’t have Down syndrome. Keep your expectations high as your child tries and learns new things. Make time to play, read, have fun, and go out together. Support your child in doing day-to-day tasks on their own. For everyday tasks, you can try to: Create a daily schedule and stick to it as best you can. For example, the morning might be getting up, eating breakfast, brushing teeth , and getting dressed. Help your child change from one activity to the next with very clear signals. For younger kids, seeing a picture or singing a song can help. Use pictures to make a daily plan your child can see. Use simple terms when talking to your child, with fewer steps. Encourage your child to repeat directions back to you. This helps to make sure they understand. Name and talk about things your child seems excited about.', ""To help your child with school, you might: Avoid saying “That’s wrong” to correct mistakes. Instead, say, “Try it again.” Offer help if it’s needed. As you work with doctors, therapists, and teachers, focus on your child’s needs rather than on the condition. Look at what your child is learning at school and see if you can work those lessons into your home life. It's also important for all kids to feel like they have some control over their lives. It’s even more important for kids with Down syndrome, and it’s one way to help them live a fulfilling life. To do this, you can: Let your child make choices when it makes sense to. This can be as simple as letting them choose what clothes to wear. Allow them to take reasonable risks. This is a challenge every parent faces. You need to protect your children, but you should also let them see what they can handle. Support them in solving problems, like how to deal with an issue with friends or approach a problem at school. You don’t have to fix it for them, but you can help them do it themselves."", 'Takeaways People with Down syndrome are born with an extra chromosome . This can lead to a range of issues that affect them mentally and physically. Nowadays, there are a lot of interventions to help people with DS lead fulfilling and productive lives.', ""Down Syndrome FAQs What is the life expectancy of someone with Down syndrome ? The lifespan for people with Down syndrome has increased over the years. In the 1980s, the lifespan was about 25 years. Now, it's around 60 years. Can Down syndrome be diagnosed later in life? Yes. Most people with DS are either diagnosed before birth through genetic testing or at birth based on physical appearance. But people with the rare mosaic Down syndrome may grow to adulthood without being aware they have it. This is probably because they may not have the typical physical features of someone with Down syndrome. Only some of their body cells have three copies of chromosome 21, while with the more common trisomy 21, every cell has three copies of chromosome 21."", ""Can people with Down syndrome have children? About half the women with Down syndrome are fertile, but most of the men with this condition are infertile. The few children born to men who had DS didn't inherit the condition. But for women with DS, about a third gave birth to children who also had it.""]"
42,What Is Duane Syndrome?,"[""Duane syndrome (DS) is a rare eye disorder some people are born with. The muscles and nerves around your eye don't work well together, and that keeps it from moving as it should. The disorder is also known as Duane's syndrome, Duane retraction syndrome, or Stilling-Turk syndrome. It happens when the nerves that control the eye muscles don't grow normally during pregnancy or are missing. As a result, some muscles stretch when they should tighten or stay loose when they need to squeeze. DS doesn't cause blindness and doesn't usually lead to other health issues. In very rare cases, it has been linked to problems with bones, eyes, ears , kidneys , and the nervous system. Most of the time, only one eye is affected -- usually the left one. But 20% of people have trouble with both eyes. Women are slightly more likely to have DS than men."", ""Types There are three types of DS: Type 1: People with this form aren't able to move their affected eye out toward their ear. This is the most common kind of DS. Type 2: The affected eye can't move inward toward the nose. Type 3: The eye can't move outward or inward."", 'Symptoms Signs of DS can include: Eyes that look different ways: This is called strabismus. It might happen all the time or just sometimes. Eyelid narrowing: One eye may look smaller than the other. Reduced vision in the affected eye: One out of every 10 people who have DS have ""lazy"" eye, a condition called amblyopia . Upshoot or downshoot: The affected eye sometimes looks up or down. Head position: People who have DS may tilt or turn their heads to try to keep their eyes straight. Some people with DS also have double vision and headaches. You might also have neck pain as a result of tilting our head.', ""Cause DS can be passed down in families, but this is rare. Ninety percent of the people who have it are the only ones in their family with it. Experts believe something happens to cause DS between the third and eighth week of pregnancy. This is when a baby's eye nerves and muscles start to develop. There's probably more than one factor involved, like problems with certain genes or the mother being exposed to something in the environment. But it isn't clear what actually causes DS."", 'Diagnosis Because DS has clear symptoms, most people are diagnosed before age 10. The exam usually includes a close look at your eye along with a vision test and measurements of how far your eye can move. The doctor also may want to do a hearing test and examine your spine , the roof of your mouth, and your hands. A gene called CHN1 is linked to some cases of DS. A genetic test can look for changes, or mutations, in the gene that might be passed on to other family members. This is done with a blood test.', ""Treatment There's no cure for DS. But your doctor can do things to help your eyes line up when you're looking straight ahead and to protect your vision. Prescription glasses or contact lenses can also help. Your doctor might recommend that you wear a patch over the eye you see best with to help avoid lazy eye , or amblyopia. This forces your weaker eye to get stronger. Your doctor may also prescribe special lenses for glasses that shift your vision so you can hold your head in a more natural way."", ""It's important to have regular eye exams -- young children may need to see their doctor every 3 to 6 months so a lazy eye can be treated right away. In severe cases, your doctor may recommend surgery to help other muscles in your eye make up for the ones that are affected. This won't give you normal eye motion, but it usually reduces the\xa0head turning.""]"
43,What Is Ptosis?,"['When you look in the mirror, do you see sleepy-looking eyes ? Maybe your upper eyelids sag a little or cover your pupil. It could be ptosis , which is a fancy way to say ""drooping.""', 'What Are the Symptoms? The main sign: One or both eyelids droop. It isn’t painful, but it can block your sight. You may have to tip your head back and lift your chin to see better. Or you might have to arch your eyebrows to lift your lids. Over time, these moves may affect your head and neck. If your child has it, they could also develop amblyopia , or ""lazy eye."" That\'s poor sight in an eye that didn\'t develop normally during childhood. This might happen if the lid droops so much it blocks vision or makes things look blurry. Treat it early in childhood so it doesn\'t cause long-term vision loss .', 'What Causes It? You can get it several ways. Sometimes, babies are born with it. You could get ptosis as an adult when the nerves that control your eyelid muscles are damaged. It might follow an injury or disease that weakens the muscles and ligaments that raise your eyelids. Sometimes, it comes with age. The skin and muscles around your eyes get weaker. Surgery -- like LASIK or cataract surgery -- can stretch your eyelid. An eye tumor can cause ptosis, too.', ""How Is It Treated? If it doesn’t affect your vision, your doctor may decide not to treat it. Often, doctors won’t treat children with ptosis. They\xa0will check their eyes regularly. And they'll probably treat amblyopia with drops, patches, or glasses. The doctor will also watch the eye to see if your child needs surgery as they get older. For adults, treatment usually does mean surgery. Your doctor may remove extra skin and tuck the muscle that lifts the lid. Or the doctor may reattach and strengthen that muscle. You may also be able to wear glasses with a special crutch built in. It lifts your eyelids so you can see better. That helps you avoid surgery."", 'How Do I Manage It? Ptosis can cause problems when you drive, read, or even walk up and down stairs. If that happens, go to your doctor. Treat any other eye issues that could cause more problems. Think about surgery if your doctor suggests it for vision loss or constriction of your vision field caused by ptosis. For teens , surgery can improve not just vision, but self-esteem. Children with ptosis should see an eye doctor regularly.']"
44,Drowning Treatment,"[""Signs of Drowning What does a drowning person look like? They're likely to be: Silent: There’s no spare breath to call for help. Bobbing up and down: Their mouth could dip below the water’s surface, pop up just enough to breathe, and sink back down. Stiff-armed: Instead of waving for help, someone who's drowning may have their arms out to the side. Their hands may be pressed down on the water to keep afloat. They most likely can't reach out to grab a life preserver. Still: Their body could be straight up and down, almost like they're standing in the water. You won't see kicking or flailing. A drowning person can only stay like this for 20-60 seconds. If you don’t get to them soon enough, they'll start to sink. You may miss the chance to help if you don’t know what’s going on. Knowing how to swim is important. But even good swimmers can drown, and it can happen fast. Never take your eye off a child in the water. You have to watch them all the time. And not just in large bodies of water. Young children can drown in hot tubs, bathtubs, decorative ponds, buckets, and even toilets."", 'Call 911 If: Someone is drowning. A child is having problems breathing or has stopped breathing as a result of being underwater. (Remember, children can drown in as little as 1 inch of water.) A child has had a near-drowning episode.', ""Drowning First Aid If an adult is in trouble, follow these steps. Keep in mind that these guidelines aren't meant to replace CPR training. Classes are always offered through the American Red Cross, local hospitals, and other groups. 1. Get help. Notify a lifeguard, if one is close. If not, ask someone to call 911. If you're alone, follow the steps below. 2. Move the person. Quickly and safely take the person out of the water. 3. Check to see if they're conscious. Shout to get a response. Tap their shoulder. Shout again. 4. If they don't respond, place them on their back on a firm surface."", '5. Start CPR. CPR guidelines have changed in recent years. The letters C-A-B (compressions, airway, breathing) can help you remember what to do.', 'Begin chest compressions: Kneel next to the person\'s neck and shoulders. Place the heel of one hand on the center of their chest at the nipple line. Place your other hand on top of it. Keep your arms straight. Press down hard, at least 2 inches. Use your entire body weight. Do chest compressions at the rate of 100-120 per minute. (Try to match the beat of the Bee Gees song ""Staying Alive."") Let their chest spring back fully between each push. Keep going until the person begins to move or help arrives. Or, if you\'re trained in CPR, you can open their airway and begin rescue (mouth-to-mouth or mouth-to-nose) breathing after 30 compressions. Open their airway: Put one palm on the person\'s forehead and tilt their head back. Use your other hand to gently lift their chin. Breathe for them: Pinch their nose closed. Cover their mouth with your own. Make a tight seal. Breathe into their mouth for 1 second. Watch to see if their chest rises. If their chest rises, give a second breath. If it doesn\'t, tilt their head back and lift their chin again. Then, repeat your breath. Take care not to breathe with too much force. Give 30 more chest compressions, followed by 2 more rescue breaths. Follow this pattern until the person begins to move or help arrives.', 'Drowning First Aid for Children and Babies For a child or baby: Carefully place them on their back on a firm surface. Begin chest compressions: For a small child, you may only need to use one hand on the center of their chest at the nipple line. For a baby, place both thumbs, side by side, in the center of their chest. Encircle your other fingers toward their back for support. Keep your arms straight. Press down hard and fast – at least 2 inches for a child, and only 1 and 1/2 inches for a baby. Keep a fairly quick rhythm, at the rate of 100-120 per minute (the same as for adults). Start rescue breathing after 30 chest compressions.', ""Open their airway: Tilt their head back and gently lift their chin. For a baby, be careful not to tilt the head back too far. With an older child, pinch their nose closed and put your mouth over their mouth, forming a tight seal. With a baby, place your mouth over both their nose and mouth. Blow for 1 second. Take care not to breathe with too much force. With a baby, you should deliver gentle puffs of air, not deep breaths. If their chest rises, give a second breath. If their chest doesn't rise, tilt their head back and lift their chin again. Then, repeat the second rescue breath. As with an adult, give 2 rescue breaths for every 30 chest compressions. Keep going until help arrives or the child or baby begins to move."", ""If two people are able to do CPR, give one to two rescue breaths after 15 chest compressions. Then trade off. If you don't feel comfortable giving rescue breaths, give chest compressions until help arrives on the scene. If you aren't trained in CPR, you may worry that you'll do it wrong. But any type of help is better than no help.""]"
45,Drug Allergies,"['You need your medicine to manage your health. They can make a huge difference in your life. But sometimes, people have an allergic reaction to a medicine. When you have an allergy, your immune system mistakenly sees something that’s harmless as an invader. Your body responds with certain chemicals, such as large amounts of histamine , to try to get rid of it. If you think you have a drug allergy , tell your doctor. There may be another treatment you could try instead.', ""Symptoms Even in people who aren't allergic, many drugs can cause issues like an upset stomach . But during an allergic reaction , the release of histamine can cause symptoms like: Hives Rash Itchy skin Itchy eyes Congestion Swelling in the mouth and throat A more severe reaction, called anaphylaxis , may include: Trouble breathing Blueness of the skin Dizziness Fainting Anxiety Confusion Rapid pulse Nausea Diarrhea Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening emergency and can lead to shock and loss of consciousness. Symptoms of a drug allergy may start right after you take it. But some take hours, days, or weeks to appear. Some people have a reaction the first time they take a drug, and others might take the drug several times before a reaction happens. And you can develop an allergy to something at any time -- even a drug you’ve taken safely for years. Most of the time, a bad reaction to a drug doesn’t mean you have an allergy. Side effects are common, especially as your body gets used to a new medication. If it’s a side effect, rather than an allergy, you’re more likely to have: Nausea Lack of energy Muscle aches Hard to sleep Coughing Headache Stuffy nose Stomach cramps Diarrhea Constipation Ringing in the ears Easy bruising"", 'What Are the Most Common Drug Allergies? Anybody can be allergic to any drug. That includes prescription medications and ones you can get over the counter. Penicillin and other similar antibiotics are the drugs most people are allergic to. Other meds commonly found to cause allergic reactions include: Sulfa drugs Barbiturates, including mephobarbital and phenobarbital Anti- seizure drugs, including carbamazepine, chlorpromazine, ethosuximide, lamotrigine, phenytoin, and zonisamide Pain medications like aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, and codeine ACE Inhibitors including captopril, enalapril, fosinopril, and lisinopril Contrast dyes used in X-rays and MRIs Echinacea and other alternative and herbal medicines', 'Diagnosis Your doctor will talk to you about your medical history and symptoms. They’ll want to know what you took, whether you’ve ever had a drug reaction or other allergies, and whether you have other medical conditions. Take note of how quickly your symptoms appeared, whether they’ve changed, and whether anything has helped. If they think you might be allergic to an antibiotic, such as penicillin , they may give you a skin test to confirm it. If you’ve had a serious skin reaction, your doctor may run blood tests to check how your organs are working and to see if there are any other signs of an allergic reaction . But skin testing doesn’t work for all drugs, and in some cases it could be dangerous. If you\'ve had a severe, life-threatening reaction to a particular drug, your doctor will simply rule out that medicine as a treatment option for you. Getting an allergy test to find out if the severe reaction was a ""true"" allergic response isn\'t needed if there are other drug options.', ""Treatment The first goal is to ease your symptoms. For instance, medicines such as antihistamines , and in some cases, corticosteroids, can often control rash , hives , and itching . For coughing and lung congestion, your doctor may prescribe drugs called bronchodilators to widen your airways. For anaphylaxis symptoms, you may need a shot of epinephrine , and you definitely need emergency medical care, even if those symptoms stop after you take epinephrine . Sometimes, doctors use a process called desensitization to treat an allergy to penicillin or other drugs. Over time, you’ll get shots of tiny amounts of penicillin, with increasingly larger amounts until your immune system can handle the drug. You'll probably only get this procedure if there aren't any other medicines that can treat your condition. If you're severely allergic to certain antibiotics , there should be alternatives that your doctor can prescribe."", 'How Can I Be Prepared? If you know you have a drug allergy, memorize the name of that drug, both brand names and generic name. Tell all your health care providers before you get any type of treatment, including dental care .', 'It’s also a good idea to carry a card or wear a special bracelet or pendant that identifies your allergy , in case of emergency. Know what to do if you have an allergic reaction . If your doctor prescribes medication for emergencies, like an EpiPen , make sure you always carry two and you know how to use it.']"

Finding the cause of the itching and treating any underlying skin disease is the first step in solving pruritus. If a drug reaction is suspected, switching to a different medication may be helpful to reduce the itching. However, most drug reactions have a rash along with itching. The best way to prevent pruritus is to take care of your skin. To protect skin: Use skin creams and lotions that moisturize your skin and prevent dryness. Use sunscreens regularly to prevent sunburns and skin damage. Use mild bath soap that won't irritate your skin. Take a bath or shower in warm -- not hot -- water. Avoid certain fabrics, such as wool and synthetics, that can make skin itch. Switch to cotton clothing and bed sheets. Since warm, dry air can make skin dry, keep the thermostat in your house down and use a humidifier . To relieve itching, place a cool washcloth or some ice over the area that itches, rather than scratching."", 'Your doctor may also prescribe medication to treat pruritus, including antihistamines and topical steroids. Rarely, steroid pills and antibiotics may also be needed.']"
47,Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy,"[""What Is Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy? Muscular dystrophies are a group of diseases that make muscles weaker and less flexible over time. Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the most common type. It’s caused by flaws in the gene that controls how the body keeps muscles healthy. The disease almost always affects boys, and symptoms usually begin early in childhood. Children with DMD have a hard time standing up, walking, and climbing stairs. Many eventually need wheelchairs to get around. They can also have heart and lung problems. Although there isn't a cure, the outlook for people with DMD is better than it has ever been. Years ago, children with the disease usually didn’t live beyond their teens. Today, they live well into their 30s, and sometimes into their 40s and 50s. There are therapies that can ease symptoms, and researchers are looking for new ones, as well."", 'Causes DMD is caused by a problem in one of your genes. Genes contain the information your body needs to make proteins, which carry out many different body functions.', ""If you have DMD, the gene that makes a protein called dystrophin is broken. This protein normally keeps muscles strong and protects them from injury. The condition is more common in boys because of the way parents pass DMD genes to their children. It’s what scientists call a sex-linked disease because it’s connected to the groups of genes, called chromosomes, that determine if a baby is a boy or a girl. It’s rare, but sometimes people who don't have a family history of DMD get the disease when their genes get defects on their own."", 'Symptoms If your child has DMD, you’ll probably notice the first signs before they\xa0turn\xa06 years old. Muscles in the legs are usually some of the first affected, so they’ll probably start to walk much later than other children their\xa0age. Once they can walk, they may fall down often and have trouble climbing stairs or getting up from the floor. After a few years, they might also begin to waddle or walk on their\xa0toes.', 'DMD also can damage the heart, lungs, and other parts of the body. As they\xa0get\xa0older, your child might have other symptoms, including: A curved spine, also called scoliosis Shortened, tight muscles in their\xa0legs, called contractures Headaches Problems with learning and memory Shortness of breath Sleepiness Trouble concentrating The muscle problems can cause cramps at times, but in general, DMD isn’t painful. Your child will still have control of their bladder and bowels. Although some children with the disorder have learning and behavior problems, DMD doesn’t affect your child’s intelligence.', 'Getting a Diagnosis You should let your child’s doctor know about the symptoms you’ve been noticing. They’ll want to know your child’s medical history, then ask questions about their\xa0symptoms, like: How old was your child when they\xa0started walking? How well do they\xa0do things like run, climb stairs, or get up from the floor? How long have you noticed these problems? Does anyone else in your family have muscular dystrophy ? If so, what kind? Do\xa0they have any trouble breathing ? How well do\xa0they pay attention or remember things?', 'The doctor will give your child a physical exam , and they may do some tests to rule out other conditions that can cause muscle weakness. If the doctor suspects DMD, they’ll do some other tests, including: Blood tests. The doctor will take a sample of your child’s blood and test it for creatine kinase, an enzyme that your muscles release when they are damaged. A high CK level is a sign that your child could have DMD. Gene tests. Doctors can also test the blood sample to look for a change in the dystrophin gene that causes DMD. Girls in the family can get the test to see if they carry this gene. Muscle biopsy . Using a needle, the doctor removes a tiny piece of your child’s muscle. They’ll look at it under a microscope to check for low levels of dystrophin, the protein that is missing in people with DMD.', 'Questions for Your Doctor If your child has DMD, you’ll want to get as much information about their\xa0condition as you can. Think about asking: What does this mean for my child? Do they\xa0need to see any other doctors? What kind of treatments are there? How will they make them feel? How can I help them be active? What kind of diet should they eat?', 'Treatment There’s no cure for DMD, but there are medicines and other therapies that can ease your child’s symptoms, protect their\xa0muscles, and keep their\xa0heart and lungs healthy. Eteplirsen ( Exondys 51 )\xa0\xa0has been approved to treat individuals with a specific mutation of the gene that leads to DMD. It is an injection medication. Its\xa0most common side effects are balance problems and vomiting. Although the drug increases dystrophin production, which would predict improvement in muscle function, this has not yet been shown. The oral corticosteroid deflazacort ( Emflaza ) was approved in 2017 to treat DMD, becoming the first FDA approval of any corticosteroid to treat the condition. Deflazacort has been found to help patients retain muscle strength as well as helping them maintain their ability to walk. Common side effects include puffiness, increased appetite and weight gain. Steroids such as prednisone slow muscle damage. Children who take this medicine are able to walk for 2 to 5 years longer than they would without it. The drugs also can help your child’s heart and lungs work better.', ""Because DMD can cause heart problems, it's important for your child to see a heart doctor, called a cardiologist, for checkups once every 2 years until age 10, and once a year after that. Girls and women who carry the gene have a higher risk of heart problems, too. They should see a cardiologist in their late teens or early adult years to check for any problems. For the small number of DMD patients\xa0with the gene mutation\xa0exon 45 skipping, the injectable\xa0casimersen (Amondys 45) has been appropved. It is the first targeted treatment for this type of mutation and has been shown to help increase the production of dystophin."", 'A small number of children with DMD may also have a gene mutation that is amenable to exon 53 Skipping. The drug golodirsen ( Vyondys 53 ) has been approved to help increase the amount of dystophin in the muscle fibers. Some blood pressure medicines may help protect against muscle damage in the heart.', ""Kids with DMD might need surgery to fix shortened muscles, straighten the spine, or treat a heart or lung problem. Scientists continue to look for new ways to treat DMD in clinical trials . These trials test new drugs to see if they are safe and if they work. They often are a way for people to try new medicine that isn't available to everyone. Your doctor can tell you if one of these trials might be a good fit for your child."", ""Taking Care of Your Child It’s overwhelming to learn that your child has DMD. Remember that the disease doesn’t mean they can’t go to school, play sports, and have fun with friends. If you stick with their\xa0treatment plan and know what works for your child, you can help them live an active life. Stand and walk as much as possible. Being upright will keep your child’s bones strong and their\xa0spine straight. Braces or standing walkers can make it easier for them to stand and get around. Eat right. There's no special diet for children with DMD, but healthy foods can prevent weight problems or help with constipation . Work with a dietitian to make sure your child eats the right balance of nutrients and calories each day. You may need to see a specialist if your child has trouble swallowing. Stay active. Exercise and stretches can keep your child’s muscles and joints limber and help them feel better. A physical therapist can teach them how to exercise safely without overworking. Find support. Other families living with DMD can be great resources for advice and understanding about life with the disease. Find a local support group or explore online discussion boards. It may also help you to talk about your feelings with a psychologist or counselor."", 'What to Expect As your child gets older, their\xa0muscles will become weaker and they most likely won’t be able to walk. Many boys with DMD will need a wheelchair by the time they are 12 years old to help them get around. Although some kids live only into their teens, the outlook for this condition is much better than it used to be. Today, young adults with DMD can go to college, have careers, marry, and start families. Scientists are also testing new ways to treat the genes that cause DMD. These treatments might soon improve the outlook for even more for people with DMD. In 2019, the FDA approved\xa0golodirsen\xa0injection (Vyondys 53,) as the first treatment for DMD\xa0in patients with a confirmed mutation amenable to exon 53 skipping and in 2014, officials in Europe approved ataluren (Translarna) as the first drug to treat the genetic cause of DMD. A few other gene therapies may soon be ready for sale in the U.S.', 'Getting Support To learn more about Duchenne muscular dystrophy or find a support group in your area, visit: Cure Duchenne , the Muscular Dystrophy Association , or the Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy .']"
48,What Is a Peptic Ulcer?,"['You have a peptic ulcer if you get open sores in the lining of your stomach or the upper part of the small intestine. That happens when your stomach acids etch away your digestive tract’s protective layer of mucus . You may have no symptoms, or you may feel discomfort or burning pain. Peptic ulcers can lead to internal bleeding, which sometimes can mean you’ll need blood transfusions in the hospital. You can have two types of peptic ulcer disease: Gastric ulcer . You get this on your stomach lining. Duodenal ulcer. This appears at the top end of the small intestine, an organ that digests and absorbs much of the food you eat. You can have ulcers at any age, but your chances go up as you get older.', 'What Causes Peptic Ulcers? Ulcers form when digestive juices damage the walls of the stomach or small intestine. If the mucus layer gets too thin or your stomach makes too much acid, your gut will feel it. The two major causes are: Bacteria. It’s called Helicobacter pylori ( H. pylori ), and as many as half of us carry it. Most people infected with H. pylori do not get ulcers. But in others, it can raise the amount of acid, break down the protective mucus layer, and irritate the digestive tract. Experts aren’t sure how H. pylori infection spreads. They think it may pass from person to person through close contact, like kissing . You may also get it from unclean food and water. Certain pain relievers. If you’ve been taking aspirin often and for a long time, you’re more likely to get a peptic ulcer . The same is true for other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ). They include ibuprofen and naproxen . NSAIDs block your body from making a chemical that helps protect the inner walls of your stomach and small intestine from stomach acid. Other types of pain meds, such as acetaminophen , won’t lead to peptic ulcers. Smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol also can make you more likely to get ulcers.\xa0 S tress and eating a lot of spicy food don’t cause ulcers, as experts once thought. But they can make ulcers worse and harder to treat.', 'What Are the Symptoms of a Peptic Ulcer? You’ll most likely feel a burning pain or discomfort between your belly button and breastbone. You might especially notice it on an empty stomach -- such as between meals or at night. The pain may stop for a little while if you eat or take an antacid, but then return. The pain can last for a few minutes or a few hours, and may come and go for many days or weeks. Other symptoms may include: Bloated feeling Burping Lack of appetite or weight loss Nausea Bloody or dark poop Vomiting Small ulcers may not cause any symptoms. But if you notice any of these signs, talk to your doctor.', 'How Is a Peptic Ulcer Diagnosed? Your doctor will ask about your symptoms, whether you take NSAIDs and other drugs, and medical history. They’ll also check you for bloating in the belly and pain. That may be enough to make a diagnosis. The only way your doctor can tell for sure if you have an ulcer is to look. They\xa0may use a series of X-rays or a test called an endoscopy . This test allows them\xa0to pass a thin, bendy tube down your throat and into your stomach and small intestine. The tube has a camera at the end so they\xa0can check the lining for ulcers. They\xa0may also take a small piece of the lining to test for H. pylori . Blood , breath, and stool sample tests also can screen for the bacteria.', 'How Is a Peptic Ulcer Treated? Some peptic ulcers heal on their own. But if you don’t treat them, the ulcers tend to come back. They can erode the blood vessel wall in your stomach or small intestine. The ulcers also can eat a hole through the lining and get infected. Or they can cause swelling, which may block food from moving from your stomach into your small intestine. If H. pylori is the culprit, your doctor may prescribe a mix of antibiotics to kill it. If aspirin and other NSAIDs are behind the ulcer, you may need to cut down on them, stop taking them altogether, or switch to another pain reliever. Your doctor may also give you antacids to fight stomach acid, or prescribe medicine to lessen the acid your body makes. Prescription drugs called cytoprotective agents can help protect the lining of the stomach or small intestine so the ulcer can heal.', 'Can You Prevent a Peptic Ulcer? While stress and spicy foods can make symptoms of a peptic ulcer worse, they don’t seem to make you more likely to have one. But a few other things can raise your chances.', ""Be careful when you take pain relievers. Some people who have arthritis or other conditions that cause chronic pain take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) for weeks or months at a time to ease pain and swelling. These medicines can affect the mucus that protects your stomach against acid and make you more likely to have peptic ulcers. These pain relievers include: Aspirin Ibuprofen Naproxen sodium You're more likely to get an ulcer while taking one of these if you: Are over age 65 Are infected with H. pylori bacteria Take more than one NSAID at a time Have had a peptic ulcer in the past Also take a steroid drug or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) To lower your chances for peptic ulcers while you take NSAIDs: Use the lowest possible dose to control your symptoms, and stop taking them as soon as you no longer need them. Take your medicine with food. Don't drink alcohol while you’re taking these medicines."", ""While you're on NSAIDs, you can take medicine to lower the amount of acid your stomach makes. Drugs that can do that include: Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) like esomeprazole ( Nexium ), omeprazole ( Prilosec OTC), and pantoprazole ( Protonix ) H2 blockers such as cimetidine ( Tagamet ), famotidine ( Pepcid ), and nizatidine You can also take the drug misoprostol ( Cytotec ) to boost the amount of protective mucus your stomach makes. But that can cause side effects like diarrhea and stomach cramps. Don’t smoke, and limit alcohol. These two habits make you more likely to get peptic ulcers. Both thin the mucus lining that protects your stomach from acid, leading to more acid. Ask your doctor to recommend a program to help you quit smoking . And talk with them about how much alcohol is safe for you to drink. Manage stress. Stress can make the symptoms of a peptic ulcer worse. Figure out what’s causing issues for you and see how you can deal with it better. For example, getting enough sleep can help with that. It also can boost your immune system ."", ""Consider probiotics. Millions of bacteria normally live in your gut. Some, like H. pylori , cause disease. Others are good for you because they help crowd out harmful bacteria. These helpful bacteria are called probiotics . They’re still being studied, but researchers think they may help with peptic ulcers . You can find them in foods like these: Dairy products that have live cultures, like yogurt, kefir, and aged cheeses Sauerkraut Kimchi Miso Tempeh Prevent H. pylori infection. About two-thirds of people around the world have this type of infection, but most don’t get ulcers because of it. Doctors don’t know how you can avoid H. pylori , but they think it spreads from person to person or through food or water . You can do some things to make an infection less likely: Wash your hands often during the day with warm water and soap so you don't catch or spread H. pylori bacteria. Clean your hands before you eat and after you go to the bathroom. If you don't have soap and water close by, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Cook meat and other foods all the way through. Only drink water that you know is clean.""]"
49,Dupuytren's Disease,"['', ""What Is Dupuytren’s Disease? Dupuytren's disease, also called Dupuytren’s contracture, \xa0is an abnormal thickening and tightening of the normally loose and flexible tissue beneath the skin of the palm and fingers, called fascia. The pinkie and ring fingers are most often affected. Both hands are usually involved, although one may have worse symptoms than the other. The fascia contains strands of fibers, like cords, that run from the palm upward into the fingers. In Dupuytren's disease, these cords tighten, or contract, causing the fingers to curl forward. In severe cases, it can lead to crippling hand deformities."", 'Dupuytren\'s Disease Symptoms The signs of Dupuytren’s disease show up in phases: Nodules : These lumps under the skin in the palm of the hand are the first symptoms for many people. The lump may feel tender and sore at first, but this discomfort eventually goes away. Cords : The nodules cause these tough bands of tissue to form under the skin in the palm. These inflexible bands cause the fingers to bend, or ""curl,"" forward toward the wrist. Contracture : As the curling gets worse, it becomes difficult, if not impossible, to straighten the fingers. People with Dupuytren\'s disease often have a hard time picking up large objects, or placing their hands into their pockets, something you might do every day\xa0to retrieve coins, cash, or your ID card. If you have this condition, you may also find it difficult to place your hand flat on the table, wear gloves, or shake hands, among other things.', ""Dupuytren's Disease Causes and Risk Factors The cause of Dupuytren's disease is unknown, but certain biochemical factors that affect the palm's connective tissue may be involved. Injuries and overuse of the hand don’t cause it. Tendons aren’t affected. However, certain things may make you more likely to develop Dupuytren's contracture. They include: Drinking a lot of alcohol, although most people with the disease do not have alcoholism Diabetes Seizures , such as those seen in people with epilepsy Smoking Having a relative with the condition Being of Northern European (English, Irish, Scottish, French, Dutch) or Scandinavian (Swedish, Norwegian, Finnish) descent Being a man over 40"", ""Dupuytren's Disease Diagnosis Your health care provider will ask you questions about your symptoms as well as your overall health, your health history, and your family’s medical history. Then they’ll examine your hands, wrists, and fingers. Diagnosis of Dupuytren's disease typically involves feeling the palm areas to check for nodules and recording how many nodules are found. Your doctor will likely ask you to try to place your hands flat on a table. You may have tests to: See how well you can grasp items with your hands. See how well you can pinch items with your fingers. Measure the feeling in your thumbs and fingers. Check your range of motion in your fingers, to see if you can straighten them all the way. Medical staff may also take pictures of your hand to document how it looks. These exams and tests will be repeated over time to determine if the condition is getting worse."", ""Dupuytren's Disease Treatment There is no cure for Dupuytren's disease. However, the condition isn’t life-threatening, and it may not cause discomfort for many years, if ever. Some people with the condition never need treatment, just monitoring."", ""If it’s painful or interferes with a person's daily activities, there are treatment options, including medication and surgery. Finger splints don’t help people with Dupuytren's disease and may even cause harm. Stretching the finger forcefully can actually speed up the inward curling of the finger. Non-surgical treatment Steroid injection : If a nodule is extremely tender, your doctor may recommend a corticosteroid injection, also called a steroid shot. A corticosteroid is a powerful anti-inflammatory medicine, which reduces swelling and inflammation . It may help ease your pain and in some cases may prevent finger contractures from getting worse, but won't straighten your finger if you already have a contracture. You might need a series of shots to see long-term results. Enzyme injection : If your fingers are already bent, your doctor may give you a shot of collagenase (Xiaflex), a mixture of enzymes that help dissolve the thick and tight tissue. This weakens the tight bands and may allow your doctor to then stretch the tightened area. The most common side effects seen with Xiaflex are swelling, bleeding, bruising, or pain at the injection site. Rarely, tendon or ligament damage may occur that requires surgery to fix. Your doctor can help you decide if enzyme injections or surgery is right for you."", 'Surgical treatment If the condition continues to get worse despite medications and your hand function is severely limited, your doctor may recommend surgery. The two most common types are: Fasciotomy : This procedure divides the thick cord of ligament tissue so the affected finger can move more freely. Your doctor numbs the area and makes a small cut in your palm near the affected finger. You’ll need to wear a splint while the area heals. Subtotal palmar fasciectomy : With this procedure, your doctor removes as much of the cord and tissue as they can so your finger can straighten out. They’ll probably make a “zig-zag” cut in your hand to reach the affected area. This is a more complicated type of surgery than a fasciotomy, so there’s more involved in recovery, including careful care of the area and possibly physical therapy and a skin graft (when healthy skin is taken from another part of your body to seal the wound).', ""You’ll have some hand swelling and discomfort after the procedure. Raising your hand above your heart level and flexing your fingers can help relieve swelling, stiffness, and pain and speed up your recovery. Recovery can take several months. Most people can move their fingers better after traditional Dupuytren's contracture surgery. However, the condition returns in about one in five people who have had this surgery."", ""Surgical Risks All surgery comes with risks. Complications of surgery are rare but may include: Infection Injury to the nerves and blood vessels in the hand Permanent stiffness of the fingers A procedure called aponeurotomy is an alternative to traditional surgery for Dupuytren's contracture. Instead of an open cut, it uses the sharp end of a needle to cut the thick bands under the skin, which may help you recover faster. However, it doesn’t work as well for people with more serious cases. Overall, there is less risk of complications, but there is a risk of nerve, blood vessel, or tendon damage. Needle aponeurotomy is even more effective when used in combination with corticosteroid injections. A specialized hand surgeon must perform this procedure. Ask your doctor what type of surgery is best for you. Your doctor may recommend physical therapy after surgery."", ""When to See a Doctor Dupuytren's contracture isn’t a dangerous condition, but it can be disabling if it becomes severe. Call your doctor for an appointment if: You have one or more lumps in your palm, whether or not it is painful. You have difficulty straightening your fingers. You have difficulty grasping objects. You cannot place your hand flat on a table or place your hand in your pocket."", 'Dupytren’s Disease Complications Because Dupuytren’s disease doesn’t usually affect your thumb or index finger, it may not bother you much early on. But it’s still important to see your doctor if you think you may have symptoms. It can get worse over time and eventually keep you from being able to open your hand, hold large objects, or fit your hand into small spaces.']"
50,How to Recognize and Manage Dysania,"['Do you struggle when the alarm goes off every morning? If you have a really hard time, you could have something called dysania. This means you simply can’t get out of bed for about 1 to 2 hours after you wake up. Doctors don’t recognize it as a medical condition, as it is not an official diagnosis. But if you experience it, you know it can be a serious problem.', 'Dysania vs. Tiredness When you can’t get going in the morning every day, it can impact every aspect of your life. Your family, boss, co-workers, and friends might not understand why you can’t function. If you have dysania, it doesn’t mean you’re lazy. You could have underlying issues that are to blame for your extreme fatigue .', 'A Sign of Another Problem? Dysania can be a symptom of many medical conditions. Some common ones are: Depression : Depression is a mood disorder that can cause sadness, loss of energy, and fatigue . Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS): People with CFS feel extreme episodes of tiredness that last for a long time and don’t get better with rest. They may not even leave their beds. Fibromyalgia : This causes widespread pain , memory problems, and mood changes. It can also make you feel exhausted. Sleep apnea : This happens when something interrupts your breathing while you sleep . It can lead to low energy and daytime sleepiness. Anemia : When you don’t have enough healthy red blood cells , your energy levels might fall. Thyroid disorders : If your thyroid gland doesn’t work like it should, you may feel sluggish. Diabetes : High blood sugar levels can zap your energy. Restless legs syndrome : This disorder causes you to move your legs while you’re at rest. Heart disease : Heart problems can make you more tired than usual. Sleep disorders : Certain sleep conditions, like insomnia or narcolepsy , can make it hard to wake up in the morning.', 'Sometimes, the medicines used to treat these problems can cause the fatigue that leads to dysania. This includes antidepressants . In one study, more than 90% of people with major depressive disorder were very tired. This was true even though more than 80% of them were already taking antidepressant meds.', 'Risk Factors Without proper treatment, your condition could get worse. If you have depression, this can be dangerous because an untreated mental health disorder could make you more likely to harm yourself. Low activity and too much sleep can also be bad for your health. The recommended amount of sleep for most adults is 6 to 8 hours per night. A 2014 study showed that people who slept longer than 10 hours a day were more likely to have psychiatric illnesses and a higher body mass index (BMI). In a 2018 paper published in the European Heart Journal , researchers found a link between sleeping more than the recommended amount and a higher risk of heart disease, stroke , and death. Specifically, those who slept more than 10 hours a day had a 41% greater risk.', ""How to Get Help Dysania isn’t a disease. It’s a serious symptom of an underlying condition. To treat it, you need to find and address the root cause or causes. If you have serious, long-term problems with getting out of bed, see your doctor.

Whatever the cause, it will help to practice good sleep habits: Follow a schedule : Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day to help control your body clock. Avoid caffeine , alcohol , and nicotine : These can disrupt your sleep. Limit naps : Long naps in the daytime may make it hard to fall asleep at night. If you do need a catnap, don’t rest for longer than 30 minutes, and don’t snooze late in the day. Exercise : Daily physical activity can boost energy and might also help you sleep better. But don’t overdo it too close to bedtime. Make your room sleep-friendly : Too much light or noise might make it hard to fall asleep. Use shades, earplugs, or a white noise machine to create a comfy place to sleep. Also, make sure your bedroom is cool. Between 60 and 67 degrees is ideal. Stay away from screens : Using tablets, phones, TVs, laptops, and other gadgets before bed can throw off your body’s clock. This can make it harder to go to sleep. Try to ditch the devices at least 30 minutes before bed.', 'Certain medicines or other therapies can also help you get a better night’s rest.

51,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,"['What Is Abnormal Uterine Bleeding? Abnormal uterine bleeding is when you bleed outside of your normal monthly period. You might hear it called anovulatory bleeding. Your flow could also be heavier or last longer than what’s typical. When it comes to menstrual cycles, there’s a wide range of “normal.” But your period shouldn’t be a problem for you month after month. If it’s so heavy or unpredictable that it keeps you from doing some activities or makes you miss work or school, you may have a medical condition that should be treated.', 'Abnormal Uterine Bleeding Symptoms The signs of abnormal uterine bleeding include: Heavy period Bleeding between your periods, after sex, or during menopause Long periods (more than 7 days) Irregular periods Doctors check these things when diagnosing abnormal uterine bleeding : How often you get your period. It should be fairly regular. The length of each cycle shouldn’t change by more than a week. If it’s shorter than 3 weeks or longer than 5, that could be a sign of a problem. How long it lasts. A typical period lasts 4 or 5 days. If yours is often less than 2 days or longer than a week, that could mean something’s wrong. How heavy it is. Most women only lose about 2 tablespoons of blood each period. More than 5 tablespoons is thought to be unusually heavy, but that’s hard to judge. Let your doctor know if you need more than one tampon or pad in an hour. Abnormally heavy menstrual bleeding is called menorrhagia . Whether you have spotting between periods. Whether you have bleeding after sex.', 'If you could be pregnant or you’re past menopause and have any kind of bleeding, call your doctor. Some spotting is common early in pregnancy, but bleeding can be a sign of a serious condition called an ectopic pregnancy . That’s when a fertilized egg implants somewhere outside your uterus, most commonly in a fallopian tube. It could also mean you’re having a miscarriage . After menopause, women who take hormone replacement therapy may still have periods. But any bleeding should be checked out.', 'Abnormal Uterine Bleeding Causes There are a few possible causes of abnormal uterine bleeding: Hormone changes. Problems with your hormones are the most common reason for abnormal uterine bleeding. When one of your ovaries releases an egg (called ovulation ), certain hormones tell your body to build up and then shed the lining of your uterus (called the endometrium ). With teenagers and women getting close to menopause, the endometrium can build up too much. That can lead to an irregular or heavy period or spotting between periods.', 'These things can throw off your hormones, too: Birth control pills and other medicines like warfarin and hormone therapy Fast weight loss or gain Emotional or physical stress An intrauterine device (IUD) Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) Problems with your uterus. Another possible reason for abnormal bleeding is a physical problem with your uterus. Millions of women have fibroids -- noncancerous tumors that grow in the muscles of the wall of the uterus. A polyp is another kind of growth that can form in the lining of your uterus. A condition called adenomyosis is where the cells similar to the ones that grow in the lining of the uterus start to grow in the muscle part of the uterus. Endometriosis can also cause abnormal bleeding. This is when tissue like the kind that lines the inside of your uterus grows outside of your uterus. Other health conditions. These are much less common, but abnormal uterine bleeding also can result from: Cancer of the cervix , endometrium, or uterus Illnesses that affect your kidneys , liver , thyroid , or adrenal glands Infection of your cervix or endometrium Sexually transmitted diseases', 'Abnormal Uterine Bleeding Diagnosis It can help to take detailed notes over a few cycles so you can give the doctor specific information about your symptoms. They’ll also ask about your overall health and give you a physical exam . You’ll probably get a pregnancy test , and you may also have: Blood work. Heavy bleeding can leave your body short of iron. A blood test can see if that’s a problem for you. It can also show if your hormones are out of balance or if you have a blood disorder or chronic disease. Ultrasound . This uses sound waves to make images of the inside of your uterus so your doctor can look for fibroids or polyps. Hysteroscopy. The doctor will look inside your uterus with a tiny lighted scope that they put in through your cervix. Biopsy . The doctor may take out a small piece of tissue and check it under a microscope for abnormal cells. Magnetic resonance imaging . This test uses radio waves and powerful magnets to make detailed pictures of your uterus. It isn’t used that often, but it can help spot adenomyosis.', 'Abnormal Uterine Bleeding Treatment Your treatment\xa0will depend on the cause of the abnormal uterine bleeding. If a chronic illness or a blood disorder is at the root of your symptoms, treating that can help. Treatment also can depend on whether you plan to have children. It might not be safe to get pregnant after some treatments, while others can make it impossible. If you’re close to menopause, the doctor may want to take a wait-and-see approach because your symptoms may get better on their own. Drugs are usually the first thing your doctor will try. They include: Hormones. Birth control pills and other hormone treatments may be able to give you regular menstrual cycles and lighter periods.

52,What Is Dyslexia?,"[""People with dyslexia have trouble reading because they can't match letters and words with the sounds they make. (Photo credit: iStock/Getty Images) Dyslexia is a learning disorder that makes it hard for you to read, spell, and write. People who have it are often smart, but their brains have trouble connecting letters they see to the sounds those letters make. About 5%-15% of Americans have some symptoms of dyslexia, like slow reading, trouble spelling, or mixing up words. Adults can have this learning disorder, but most people are diagnosed early in life.

Praise your child's strength and skills. Don't let learning struggles be the main focus.""]"
53,What Is Leukodystrophy?,"['Leukodystrophy isn’t just one disease; it’s actually a group of diseases that affect the central nervous system. Doctors are discovering new forms of leukodystrophy all the time, but experts currently know of about 52 different kinds. Most of the leukodystrophies are genetic, meaning they’re passed down from parent to child. Sometimes symptoms will show up early in childhood. But because the diseases are progressive, meaning they get worse over time, some children born with a form of leukodystrophy may seem fine.', 'Symptoms The one thing all leukodystrophies have in common is they cause abnormal development or destruction of the brain’s myelin sheath. That’s the white fatty matter that protects the brain’s nerves. Without it, your nervous system can’t function properly. But each leukodystrophy affects myelin differently. That means children can have many problems, including: Balance and mobility problems Behavioral and learning disabilities Bladder issues Breathing difficulties Developmental delays Hearing, speech, and vision problems Muscle control disorders Seizures', 'For example, one type of leukodystrophy, Canavan disease, causes decreased muscle tone, especially in the neck, and abnormally straight legs and flexed arms. It can also include symptoms like blindness and seizures. Sometimes symptoms show up soon after a child is born, and sometimes as late as adulthood. Signs of Refsum Disease, for example, usually occur around age 20, but can be as late as age 50. Some of the common symptoms include degeneration of the retina in the eye, deafness, and loss of sense of smell. While every leukodystrophy is different, the most common problem is a child’s health gradually worsening in some way, even though they seemed fine to start with. This can be a worsening of their vision, hearing, speech, ability to eat, behavior, or thought. Since symptoms can vary so much, leukodystrophy can be hard to diagnose.', 'Causes Most of the leukodystrophies are inherited, which means they’re passed down through family genes. Some may not be inherited, but are still caused by a genetic mutation. One child in your family could have leukodystrophy, and others might not.', 'For example, Alexander disease doesn’t seem to be genetically inherited, so your child can have a defective gene even if neither you nor your partner have it. If you have a child with leukodystrophy and you’re planning to have more children, you may want to consider genetic counseling. It can help you understand your chances of having another child with leukodystrophy.', 'Diagnosis Diagnosing leukodystrophy can be difficult. Oftentimes, doctors have to use several types of testing, including: Blood and urine analysis CT scans Genetic testing MRI scans Psychological and cognitive tests', 'Treatment There is no cure for most kinds of leukodystrophy. Treating it depends on the type, and doctors address the symptoms of the disease with medications and special kinds of physical, occupational, and speech therapy. Some people may need additional help with learning or nutrition. In some cases, a bone marrow transplant can help by slowing or stopping the progression of the disease. Scientists are also researching whether gene therapy or replacing certain enzymes can help treat some kinds of leukodystrophy.']"
