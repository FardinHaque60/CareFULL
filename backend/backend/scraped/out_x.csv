0,What Are Motor Neuron Diseases?,"When you take a walk, talk to a friend, or chew a piece of food, motor neurons are behind these movements. Just like other parts of your body, they can become damaged. You may have heard of ALS, commonly known as Lou Gehrig’s disease. It’s one kind of motor neuron disease, and there are several other lesser-known types. What Are Motor Neurons? They are a type of nerve cell, and their job is to send messages around your body so you can move. You have two main kinds: Upper motor neurons are in your brain. They send messages from there to your spinal cord. Lower motor neurons are in your spinal cord. They transmit the messages sent from your brain to your muscles. As nerve cells die when you have a motor neuron disease, electrical messages can't get from your brain to your muscles. Over time, your muscles waste away. You may hear a doctor or nurse call this “atrophy.” When this happens, you lose control over movements. It gets harder to walk, talk, swallow, and breathe. Each kind of motor neuron disease affects different types of nerve cells or has a different cause. ALS is the most common of these diseases in adults. Here's a look at some of the types of motor neuron diseases. Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) ALS affects both your upper and lower motor neurons. With ALS, you gradually lose control over the muscles that help you walk, talk, chew, swallow, and breathe. Over time, they weaken and waste away. You may also have stiffness and twitches in your muscles. Most of the time, ALS is what doctors call “sporadic.” This means anyone can get it. Only about 5% to 10% of cases in the United States run in families. ALS usually starts between the ages of 40 and 60.  Most people with the disease live for 3 to 5 years after their symptoms start, yet some people can live for 10 years or longer. Primary Lateral Sclerosis (PLS) PLS is similar to ALS, but it affects only upper motor neurons. It causes weakness and stiffness in the arms and legs, a slowed walk, and poor coordination and balance. Speech also becomes slow and slurred. Like ALS, it usually starts in people 40 to 60 years old. The muscles get stiffer and weaker over time. But unlike ALS, people don't die from it. Progressive Bulbar Palsy (PBP) This is a form of ALS. Many people with this condition will eventually develop ALS. PBP damages motor neurons in the brain stem, which is at the base of your brain. The stem has motor neurons that help you chew, swallow, and speak. With PBP, you might slur your words and have trouble chewing and swallowing. It also makes it hard to control emotions. You may laugh or cry without meaning to. Pseudobulbar Palsy This is similar to progressive bulbar palsy. It affects motor neurons that control the ability to talk, chew, and swallow. Pseudobulbar palsy causes people to laugh or cry with no control. Progressive Muscular Atrophy This form is much less common than ALS or PBP. It can be inherited or sporadic. Progressive muscular atrophy mainly affects your lower motor neurons. Weakness usually starts in your hands and then spreads to other parts of the body. Your muscles get weak and may cramp. This disease can turn into ALS. Spinal Muscular Atrophy This is an inherited condition that affects lower motor neurons. A defect in a gene called SMN1 causes spinal muscular atrophy. This gene makes a protein that protects your motor neurons. Without it, they die. This causes weakness in the upper legs and arms, and in the trunk. SMA comes in different types that are based on when symptoms first appear: Type 1 (also called Werdnig-Hoffmann disease). It starts around age 6 months. Children with this type can't sit on their own or hold up their head. They have weak muscle tone, poor reflexes, and trouble swallowing and breathing. Type 2. It starts between 6 and 12 months. Kids with this form can sit, but they can't stand or walk alone. They may also have trouble breathing. Type 3 (also called Kugelberg-Welander disease). It starts between ages 2 and 17. It affects how a child can walk, run, stand up, and climb stairs. Kids with this type may also have a curved spine or shortened muscles or tendons around their joints. Type 4. It usually starts after age 30 . People with this type may have muscle weakness, shaking, twitching, or breathing problems. It mainly affects muscles in the upper arms and legs. Kennedy's Disease It’s also inherited, and it affects only males. Females can be carriers but don’t get ill from it. A woman with the Kennedy’s disease gene has a 50% chance of passing it on to a son. Males with Kennedy's disease have shaking hands, muscle cramps and twitches, and weakness in their face, arms, and legs. They may have trouble swallowing and speaking. Men can have enlarged breasts and a low sperm count. Living With a Motor Neuron Disease The outlook is different for each type of motor neuron disease. Some are milder and progress more slowly than others. Although there is no cure for motor neuron diseases, medicines and therapy can ease symptoms and improve your quality of life."
1,What Is Fragile X Syndrome?,"Fragile X syndrome is a condition that affects a child's learning, behavior, appearance, and health. Symptoms can be mild or more severe. Doctors also call it Martin-Bell syndrome. Boys often have a more serious form of it than girls. Children who are born with this genetic condition can get special education and therapy to help them learn and develop like other kids. Medicines and other treatments can improve their behavior and physical symptoms. What Are the Symptoms of Fragile X Syndrome? There are several, including: Trouble learning skills like sitting, crawling, or walking Problems with language and speech Hand-flapping and not making eye contact Temper tantrums Poor impulse control Anxiety Depression Obsessive-compulsive behaviors Extreme sensitivity to light or sound Hyperactivity and trouble paying attention Aggressive and self-destructive behavior in boys Trouble picking up on social cues Seizures Attention deficit disorder (ADD) Autism symptoms that affect communication and how they deal with other people Fragile X Syndrome and Autism More people with fragile X have autism compared to those without the condition. Fragile X can sometimes cause autism. And if your child has autism, they have a 2%-6% chance of also having fragile X syndrome. If your child has both fragile X and autism, they’re more likely to have seizures, sleep issues, more behavioral issues, and need more medications. Almost 80% of children with fragile X also have attention deficit disorder (ADD) or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Some children with fragile X also have changes to their face and body that can include: A large head A long, narrow face Soft skin Crossed or lazy eyes Low muscle tone A high-arched roof of their mouth Large ears A large forehead and chin Loose joints Flat feet Enlarged testicles (after puberty) Signs of fragile X usually start with delayed speech and language trouble by the age of 2. Boys are usually diagnosed around 35-37 months old. Girls are diagnosed around 42 months old. Symptoms are usually milder in girls. While most boys with fragile X have trouble with learning and development, girls usually don't have these issues. Girls with fragile X sometimes have trouble getting pregnant when they grow up. They might also go into menopause earlier than usual. This condition can also cause problems like: Hearing problems Vision problems Heart problems Sleep problems Obesity What Causes Fragile X Syndrome? The FMR1 gene, which is on the X chromosome, makes a protein called FMR that helps nerve cells talk to one another. A child needs this protein for their brain to develop normally. Children with fragile X make too little or none of it. People with this condition also have more copies than usual of a DNA segment known as CGG. In most people, this segment repeats five to 40 times. In people with fragile X, it repeats more than 200 times. The more times this DNA segment repeats, the more serious the symptoms are. A mother with the FMR1 gene change has a 50% chance of passing it to any of their children. A father can only pass it to daughters. Boys are more likely to have fragile X than girls, and they have more severe symptoms. This is because girls have two copies of the X chromosome. Even if one X chromosome has the gene change, the other copy can be fine. Boys have one X and one Y chromosome. If the X chromosome has the gene change, they will have symptoms of fragile X syndrome. Some people inherit the fragile X gene without having symptoms. They are called carriers. Carriers can pass the gene change to their children. What Are the Risk Factors for Fragile X Syndrome? The number isn’t clear, but about 1 in 8,000 to 11,000 females have fragile X syndrome, while 1 in 4,000 to 7,000 males have the condition. There aren’t any risk factors for fragile X that you can control. If you have the FMR1 gene, your child could have it, too. There’s no way to prevent fragile X syndrome. How Do Doctors Diagnose Fragile X Syndrome? These tests can be done during pregnancy to see if an unborn baby has fragile X: Amniocentesis -- doctors check a sample of amniotic fluid for the FMR1 gene change Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) -- doctors test a sample of cells from the placenta to check for the FMR1 gene After the child is born, a blood test can diagnose fragile X syndrome. This test looks for the FMR1 gene change. Babies born with fragile X syndrome don't always show signs of it. The doctor might notice that the baby's head is larger than usual. As the child gets older, learning and behavior problems can start. What’s the Treatment for Fragile X Syndrome? No medicine can cure fragile X. Treatments can help your child learn more easily and manage problem behaviors. Options include: Special education to help with learning (IEP and 504 are education plans that guide the school in providing support) Speech and language therapy Occupational therapy to help with daily tasks Behavior therapy Medicines to prevent seizures, manage ADD symptoms like hyperactivity, and treat other behavioral problems The earlier you start treatment, the better. Work with your child's doctor, teachers, and therapists to make a treatment program. Your child might also qualify for free special education services. What’s the Outlook for People With Fragile X Syndrome? The symptoms of fragile X aren’t life-threatening. Your life expectancy with the conditions is the same for anyone without it. A lot of people with the condition are able to live successful lives on their own. About 8 out of 20 women and 1 in 20 men with fragile X don’t need help with daily activities. People with the condition can go to school, have conversations, read books, learn new ideas, and finish other tasks by themselves. How Can You Find Support With Fragile X Syndrome? To learn more about fragile X, join a support group. Or reach out to an organization like the National Fragile X Foundation for advice and resources. There, you can learn about local events and groups for people with fragile X. There are also resources for parents. If you recently found out that your child has fragile X, this site offers many tips, videos, and firsthand experiences to help you understand how to care for them."
2,Turner Syndrome,"What Is Turner Syndrome? Turner syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that’s found only in girls. It can cause problems ranging from short height to heart defects. Sometimes, the symptoms are so mild that it doesn’t get diagnosed until a female is a teen or young adult. The condition can cause symptoms throughout your life, but treatments and continued research help people manage their condition. Turner Syndrome Causes Turner syndrome happens when a female is missing certain genes that are normally on the X chromosome. (Females have two X chromosomes. Males have an X and a Y). Some girls with Turner are actually missing a whole copy of the X chromosome. For others, just part of one containing the particular set of genes is missing. The different ways genes can be affected include: Monosomy . A problem with the mom’s egg or dad’s sperm causes an absence of the X chromosome in every cell of the body. Mosaicism . When cell division during early stages of fetal development doesn’t happen correctly, some cells in the body get two complete copies of the X chromosome. Other cells have only one copy. X chromosome abnormalities . Cells have one complete copy and one abnormal or missing copy of the X chromosome. Y chromosome material . In a few cases, some cells get one copy of the X chromosome and other cells get one copy of the X chromosome and some Y chromosome material. Biologically, you develop as a female. The Y chromosome material increases your risk of a type of cancer called gonadoblastoma. About 70,000 U.S. women and girls live with it. Research has found that almost 99% of babies missing the chromosome are miscarried. But about 1% of the time, these babies are born, and they have the syndrome. Symptoms of Turner Syndrome Signs of Turner syndrome can start even before birth, and they give parents some idea that their baby might be born with the condition. An ultrasound of a baby with it may show heart and kidney problems or a buildup of fluid. A DNA test using a blood sample from the mother can also screen for Turner syndrome before birth. At birth or during infancy, girls might have a number of physical features that point to the condition. Swollen hands and feet or smaller than average height at birth are among them. Others include: A wide or weblike neck with extra folds of skin Receding or small lower jaw and a high, narrow roof of the mouth (palate) Low-set ears and a low hairline Broad chest with widely spaced nipples Arms that turn outward at the elbows Short fingers and toes and narrow fingernails and toenails Delayed growth Heart defects Down-turning eyelids Short roots of teeth Kidney abnormalities Greater than usual number of moles on the skin In older females, throughout the lifespan, symptoms can continue. They can include: No growth spurts at expected times in childhood A shorter height than might be expected based on parents’ height Learning disabilities Inability to go through puberty normally (because of ovarian failure) Loss of menstrual cycles Infertility Turner Syndrome Complications Beginning at birth and continuing throughout a person’s life, Turner syndrome can be linked with other health conditions. They might include: Heart problems because of its physical structure Increased chance of diabetes and high blood pressure Hearing loss Kidney problems that can raise the chance of high blood pressure and urinary tract infections Immune disorders such as diabetes , inflammatory bowel disease , and hypothyroidism (when your thyroid gland can’t make enough hormone to keep your body running as it should) Bleeding in the digestive tract Dental and vision problems Scoliosis , which is a curving of the spine , and osteoporosis , which causes brittle bones Learning disabilities High blood pressure Mental health issues Obesity Women with Turner have trouble conceiving. If you’re able to become pregnant , high blood pressure and gestational diabetes might be issues. Turner Syndrome Diagnosis If an ultrasound shows something abnormal while you’re pregnant, your doctor may want to examine your baby’s chromosomes with a karyotype. This test compares chromosomes by lining them up. To get samples from you, your doctor may recommend: Amniocentesis. This is when protective fluid that surrounds a baby is taken from your uterus. Blood sample. This can help find out whether the baby is missing all or part of an X chromosome. Chorionic villus sampling (CVS). Your doctor removes tissue samples from a portion of the placenta for testing. This test is typically done around 10-12 weeks of pregnancy. Cheek scraping or skin sample. Your doctor may be able to test you using cells scraped from the inside of your cheek (buccal smear), or a sample of skin cells. If a diagnosis isn’t made before or at birth, other lab tests that check hormones, thyroid function and blood sugar can help diagnose it. Because of the problems linked to Turner syndrome, doctors will also often suggest tests for the kidneys, heart, and hearing. Turner Syndrome Treatments Medical care often calls for a team of specialists that’s built around the specific needs of each person, because the cases vary so widely. There’s no cure, but most girls will take the same main therapies during childhood and the teen years. These are: Growth hormone , given as an injection a few times a week, to increase height as much as possible. Estrogen therapy, beginning around the time of puberty until a woman reaches the average age of menopause . This hormone treatment can help a woman grow and reach adult sexual development. Almost all women with the condition need fertility treatments to become pregnant. And carrying a child can come with health risks. If you have Turner syndrome, you should discuss those issues with your doctor."
3,Klinefelter Syndrome (XXY Syndrome),"What Is Klinefelter Syndrome? Klinefelter syndrome is a genetic condition in which a boy is born with an extra X chromosome. Instead of the typical XY chromosomes in men, they have XXY, so this condition is sometimes called XXY syndrome. Men with Klinefelter usually don’t know they have it until they run into problems trying to have a child. There’s no cure, but it can be treated. What Causes Klinefelter Syndrome? You get the extra X chromosome by chance. Either the egg or the sperm that came together to create you had an extra X chromosome. Older women have a slightly higher chance of having a boy with XXY syndrome, but the chance is small. Men with Klinefelter may have: An extra X chromosome in every cell, which is the most common An extra X chromosome in only some cells, called mosaic Klinefelter, in which you don’t have as many symptoms More than one extra X chromosome, which is very rare and more severe Symptoms of Klinefelter Syndrome Some men show symptoms of Klinefelter as children, but others don’t know they have it until puberty or adulthood. Many men never realize that they have it because symptoms aren’t always present. Symptoms of Klinefelter vary with age and include: Babies: Hernia More quiet than usual Slower to learn to sit up, crawl, and talk Testicles that haven’t dropped into the scrotum Weaker muscles Children: A hard time making friends and talking about feelings Low energy levels Problems learning to read, write, and do math Shyness and low confidence Teenagers: Larger breasts than normal Less facial and body hair , and it comes in later Less muscle tone and muscles grow slower than usual Longer arms and legs, wider hips, and a shorter torso than other boys their age Puberty never comes, comes later, or doesn’t quite finish Small penis and small, firm testicles Taller than usual for the family Adults: Infertility (can’t have children because they can’t make enough sperm) Low sex drive Low testosterone levels Problems getting or keeping an erection Klinefelter Syndrome Diagnosis To diagnose Klinefelter syndrome, your doctor will start with a physical exam and questions about your symptoms and general health. They’ll probably examine your chest, penis , and testicles and do a few simple tests, such as checking your reflexes. Your doctor may then run two main tests: Chromosome analysis. Also called karyotype analysis, this blood test looks at your chromosomes. Hormone tests. These check hormone levels in your blood or urine . Treatment of Klinefelter Syndrome It’s never too late to treat Klinefelter, but the earlier you start, the better. One common treatment is testosterone replacement therapy . It can start at puberty and can spur typical body changes, such as facial hair and a deeper voice. It can also help with penis size and stronger muscles and bones, but it won’t affect testicle size or fertility. Testosterone replacement therapy throughout your life can help prevent some of the long-term problems that come with Klinefelter. Other treatments include: Counseling and support for mental health issues Fertility treatment (in some cases, using your own sperm to father a child) Occupational therapy and physical therapy to help with coordination and build muscles Plastic surgery to reduce breast size Speech therapy for children Support in school to help with social skills and learning delays If your child has Klinefelter, things that might help include: Playing sports and other physical activities to build muscles Taking part in group activities to learn social skills Complications of Klinefelter Syndrome Many problems caused by Klinefelter are because of lower testosterone levels. You may have a slightly higher chance of: Autoimmune problems, such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis , in which your immune system attacks healthy parts of your body Breast cancer and cancers that affect your blood , bone marrow, and lymph nodes Conditions with your hormone glands, such as diabetes Heart disease and problems with blood vessels Lung disease Mental health problems, such as anxiety and depression Weak bones, called osteoporosis Prognosis for Klinefelter Syndrome Treatment can help boys and men with Klinefelter live happy, healthy lives. Advances in fertility treatments have made it possible for some to father children. In general, life expectancy is normal. Some research has found that life expectancy for men with the condition may be a year or two less than those without it  because of other health problems linked to Klinefelter."
