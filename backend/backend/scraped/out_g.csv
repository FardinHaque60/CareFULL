0,What Are Lysosomal Storage Disorders?,"['Lysosomal storage disorders are a group of more than 50 rare diseases. They affect the lysosome -- a structure in your cells that breaks down substances such as proteins, carbohydrates, and old cell parts so the body can recycle them. People with these disorders are missing important enzymes (proteins that speed up reactions in the body). Without those enzymes, the lysosome isn’t able to break down these substances. When that happens, they build up in cells and become toxic. They can damage cells and organs in the body. This article covers some of the most common lysosomal storage disorders.', 'Types of Lysosomal Storage Disorders Each disorder affects a different enzyme and has its own set of symptoms. They include: Fabry disease : It affects your ability to make alpha-galactosidase A . This enzyme breaks down a fatty substance called globotriaosylceramide. Without the enzyme, this fat builds up in cells and damages them. Symptoms might include: Pain, numbness, tingling, or burning in the hands and feet Body aches Fever Tiredness Red or purple skin sores Trouble sweating Swelling in the lower legs, ankles , and feet Clouding of the cornea (the clear cover on the front of the eye ) Diarrhea , constipation , or both Trouble breathing Ringing in the ears and hearing loss Dizziness Abnormal heart rhythms, heart attack , and stroke', 'Gaucher disease : A lack of glucocerebrosidase (GBA) causes this condition. This enzyme breaks down a fat called glucocerebroside. Without GBA, the fat builds up in the spleen , liver , and bone marrow. Gaucher disease comes in three types, each with different symptoms. In general, symptoms include: Anemia (low red blood cell count) Enlarged spleen and liver Easy bleeding and bruising Tiredness Bone pain and fractures Joint pain Eye problems Seizures Krabbe disease: This affects the nervous system . A lack of the enzyme galactosylceramidase causes this condition. This enzyme helps make and maintain myelin , the protective coating around nerve cells that helps nerves talk to each other. Symptoms start in the first few months of life and include: Muscle weakness Stiff limbs Trouble walking Vision and hearing loss Muscle spasms Seizures Metachromatic leukodystrophy ( MLD ): You can get MLD if you don’t have the enzyme arylsulfatase A . It normally breaks down a group of fats called sulfatides. Without the enzyme, these fats build up in white matter -- the part of the brain that contains nerve fibers. They destroy the myelin coating that surrounds and protects nerve cells.', ""MLD comes in different forms. Symptoms can include: Loss of feeling in the hands and feet Seizures Trouble walking and talking Vision and hearing loss Mucopolysaccharidosis ( MPS ): This is a group of diseases that affects enzymes that break down certain carbohydrates. The unbroken carbohydrates build up in many different organs. Symptoms of MPS affect many parts of the body and can include: Short height Stiff joints Trouble speaking and hearing Ongoing runny nose Learning problems Heart issues Joint problems Trouble breathing Depression Niemann-Pick disease: This is a group of disorders. The most common forms are types A, B, and C. In types A and B, people lack an enzyme called acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) . It breaks down a fatty substance called sphingomyelin, which is found in every cell. In type C, the body can't break down cholesterol and fats in cells. Cholesterol builds up in the liver and spleen. Other fats build up in the brain . Symptoms of Niemann-Pick include: An enlarged liver and spleen Trouble moving your eyes up and down Jaundice (yellow skin and eyes ) Slow development Breathing problems Heart disease"", 'Pompe disease : It affects the enzyme alpha-glucosidase (GAA) . This enzyme breaks down the sugar glycogen into glucose. Without GAA, glycogen builds up in muscle cells and other cells. Symptoms include: Severe muscle weakness Poor muscle tone Lack of growth and weight gain in infants An enlarged heart , liver, or tongue Tay-Sachs disease: This is caused by a lack of the enzyme hexosaminidases A (Hex-A) . This enzyme breaks down a fatty substance called GM2 ganglioside in brain cells. Without it, the fat builds up in nerve cells and damages them. Babies with Tay-Sachs grow normally for the first few months of life. Then their development slows. They lose control over their muscles. It becomes harder for them to sit, crawl, and walk. Other symptoms include: A red spot in the back of the eye Vision and hearing loss Seizures', ""How Do These Disorders Happen? Most lysosomal storage disorders are passed down from parents to their children. Usually, a child has to inherit the faulty gene from both parents. If a child gets the gene from only one parent, they will be a carrier and won't show symptoms."", 'The faulty genes affect how your body makes enzymes that break down material in the cells. Lysosomal storage diseases are rare, but some forms are more common in certain groups of people. For example, Gaucher and Tay-Sachs happen more often in people of European Jewish descent.', 'Symptoms The symptoms depend on which enzyme is missing. Each of these conditions has different symptoms based on the cells and organs it affects.', ""Diagnosis Your doctor can test for these disorders in your baby during pregnancy . If you have a child with symptoms, blood tests can look for the enzyme that's missing. The doctor might also do these tests: MRI uses powerful magnets and radio waves to make pictures of the brain . Biopsy removes a small piece of tissue, which is checked under a microscope for signs of disease. Finding these diseases early is key. Treatments can slow lysosomal storage disorders and improve your child's outlook."", ""Treatments Though there isn't a cure for lysosomal storage disorders, a few treatments can help. Enzyme replacement therapy delivers the missing enzyme through a vein (IV). Substrate reduction therapy reduces the substance that is building up in the cells. For example, the drug miglustat (Zavesca) treats one form of Gaucher disease. Stem cell transplant uses donated cells to help the body make the enzyme it's missing. Treatments to manage symptoms of the disease include: Medicine Surgery Physical therapy Dialysis (a treatment that removes toxic substances from the body)""]"
1,What Is a Prolactinoma?,"[""The pituitary gland is a pea-sized gland at the base of your brain . It makes several different hormones, including one called prolactin. Prolactin affects the mammary glands and helps women make breast milk. Sometimes, a tumor grows on the pituitary gland and makes too much prolactin. This kind of tumor is called a prolactinoma. It's the most common type of pituitary tumor and is most often benign, which means it’s not cancer. A new mom's prolactin levels go up every time their\xa0baby nurses. But for men or women who aren't nursing, high prolactin in the blood can be a sign of a prolactinoma. Doctors don't know what causes it, but it's fairly common. It happens more often in women than men, and it's rare in kids."", 'Symptoms The signs of a prolactinoma are different in men and women. For women, typical symptoms of a small tumor include: Irregular menstrual periods Lack of menstrual periods Low sex drive Painful intercourse (caused by vaginal dryness ) Problems with fertility Unusual production of breast milk', ""Because changes in a woman's period are obvious, prolactinomas are more likely to be found early in premenopausal women. Postmenopausal women, who no longer get their periods, may not notice symptoms when the tumor is small. When a prolactinoma becomes large, it may press up against other nearby tissues. Symptoms then can include vision loss , vision changes , and headaches. When a man is diagnosed with a prolactinoma, it tends to be large. Men often aren't diagnosed when they have early signs, which include: Problems getting or maintaining an erection Decreased interest in sex Breast milk production in rare cases Headaches or vision problems are usually the symptoms that bring men to the doctor."", 'Diagnosis You can expect a physical exam , a medical history questionnaire, and a blood test. If the test shows a high prolactin level, your blood also may be tested to find out how well your thyroid is working. If your doctor thinks you might have a pituitary tumor, they may order an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). This uses powerful magnets and radio waves to get a clear picture of your pituitary gland. If a prolactinoma is found, you may need more blood tests to see if your pituitary gland is making other hormones like it should. You may also need more MRIs to see if the tumor grows and if it responds to treatment.', ""Treatment Certain drugs can shrink it, especially when it's small. This works well for about 80% of people who have the tumor. The two approved medications for prolactinoma are bromocriptine ( Parlodel ) and cabergoline ( Dostinex ). They are dopamine agonists. These drugs act like the brain chemical dopamine, which normally keeps the pituitary gland from making too much prolactin. When medical treatment works, most premenopausal women get their periods again and regain their fertility. If medication doesn't shrink the tumor, or you can't take it because of side effects (like nausea or dizziness ), your doctor may recommend surgery to take the tumor out through your nasal cavity. This returns prolactin levels to normal for about 80% of people with small tumors. But it's successful for only 30% to 40% of people with larger tumors. In rare cases, radiation therapy is used if medicine and surgery don't bring down prolactin levels. This works for about 1 in 3 people.""]"
2,What Is Galactosemia?,"['Breast milk is full of good things that babies need -- key nutrients, hormones, and antibodies that protect them from disease and keep them healthy. But some babies are born with galactosemia . It’s a rare metabolic condition that prevents them from processing galactose (one of the sugars in breast milk and formula ) and turning it into energy. The disorder can cause many problems for newborns and can be life-threatening if left untreated. It’s easy to test for galactosemia. It’s also simple to treat once it’s diagnosed. And children who have it can live normal lives.', 'What Causes It? Galactosemia is hereditary. Both parents must pass it down for their child to get it. If your baby has this condition, it means the genes that produce the enzymes to break down galactose into glucose (a sugar ) are missing key parts. Without these parts, the genes can’t tell the enzymes to do their job. This causes galactose to build up in the blood , creating problems, especially for newborns.', 'There are three main types of galactosemia: Classic (type I) Galactokinase deficiency (type II) Galactose epimerase deficiency (type III) Type I occurs in about 1 in every 30,000 to 60,000 people. Type II and type III are less common. As a parent or potential parent, you and your partner can be genetically screened for galactosemia. If you’re a carrier , it doesn’t mean you have to avoid galactose. But it means you can pass galactosemia along to your children if your partner is also a carrier.', 'Symptoms If your newborn has classic galactosemia, they’ll appear normal at birth. Symptoms start to show up within a few days after they begin to drink breast milk or formula with lactose -- the milk sugar that contains galactose. Your baby first loses their\xa0appetite and starts vomiting . Then they get jaundice , a yellowing of the skin and the whites of their eyes . Diarrhea is common, too. The disease leads to severe weight loss and your baby struggles to grow and thrive. Without treatment, over time your child may develop cataracts and can be susceptible to infections. They may have liver damage and kidney problems. Their brain may not mature well. That can cause developmental disabilities . Some children have issues with their motor skills and muscles. For girls, it can cause their ovaries to stop working. Most with this condition can’t have children.', 'Testing and Treatment Every baby born at a U.S. hospital is given what’s called a newborn screening . A blood sample is taken from a heel stick (a tiny cut in the baby’s foot ) and it is tested for several conditions. Galactosemia is one of them. If your baby shows signs of the illness, your doctor will suggest a follow-up test to confirm. This test will include both a blood and urine sample. If your child has galactosemia, your doctor will work with you to plan a diet. Lactose and galactose are taken out of their\xa0diet. Instead, they’re given soy-based formula and must avoid milk or milk byproducts. Your doctor will likely refer your child to a specialist. Though a person with galactosemia will never be able to process this type of sugar, they can live normal lives if the disease is caught early enough. Along with eliminating dairy, your doctor may recommend cutting out some fruits, vegetables, and candies that contain galactose. In addition, your child may need to take vitamin and mineral supplements such as calcium , vitamin C , vitamin D , and vitamin K .', 'Some babies have a form of the condition called Duarte galactosemia (DG), which is milder than the classic form (type I). Babies with DG may have some issues processing galactose but a recent showed that changing the diet change may not be necessary and most babies do fine continuing breastfeeding or continuing formula with galactose.. Babies with type II or type III also will have fewer issues than babies with classic galactosemia. However, they still can develop cataracts , kidney and liver issues, and have delayed growth. Girls with galactosemia may require hormone treatment when they reach puberty . It’s important that parents of a child with galactosemia work with a health care team to find ways to help them live with the condition and its effects on their\xa0daily life.']"
3,Cholecystitis,"['What Is Cholecystitis? Cholecystitis is a swelling and irritation of your gallbladder , a small organ in the right side of your belly near your liver . The gallbladder’s job is to hold a digestive juice called bile. It releases bile into your small intestine when your body needs it to break down fats. But if the path to your small intestine is blocked, bile gets trapped. That backup can irritate your gallbladder. That’s how cholecystitis happens. Nausea and vomiting are common symptoms. They often show up after you’ve eaten a big or especially fatty meal. It’s easy to mistake cholecystitis for other health problems, but another telltale sign is intense pain -- in your belly, in your back, or under your right shoulder blade. If you don’t see a doctor and get treatment, it can lead to dangerous infections or become a long-term condition. The most common solution is surgery to remove your gallbladder.', 'Cholecystitis Symptoms Cholecystitis can mimic other health problems, so you’ll need to see a doctor for a diagnosis.', 'You might feel a sharp, sudden pain in the upper right side of your belly. You may also feel pain in your back or below your right shoulder blade. Deep breaths may make it worse. Some other symptoms to watch out for include: Nausea Vomiting Fever Bloating Yellow skin or eyes ( jaundice ) Bowel movements that are loose and light-colored Symptoms may get worse after a high- fat meal. If you can’t get comfortable or sit still because your pain is so strong, head to an emergency room.', 'Cholecystitis Causes The usual reason bile backs up is that gallstones -- lumps of bile turned solid -- block the way to the small intestine. Gallstones are common. About 10% to 20% of Americans have them. About half of people with gallstones will get cholecystitis. But gallstones aren’t the only problem that can cause this condition. Others include: Gallbladder sludge, a thick liquid, builds up in the organ. This can happen if you’re pregnant or if you’ve lost a lot of weight quickly. Tumors block bile’s path. A growth in your pancreas or liver can stop it from draining. Your gallbladder doesn’t have a good blood supply. People with diabetes can have this problem. An infection affects your gallbladder. Bacteria can damage the system that drains bile, causing it to back up. Cholecystitis can come on suddenly. You may hear a doctor or nurse call it an “acute” case. Or it can be a long-term problem. Those cases are called “chronic.”', ""Cholecystitis Risk Factors You have a higher chance of getting cholecystitis if you: Are a woman older than 50 Are a man older than 60 Are overweight Have diabetes Are pregnant Or if you have: Crohn's disease End-stage kidney disease H eart disease Hyperlipidemia (when your blood has too many lipids in it) Sickle cell disease Quick weight loss You also run a bigger chance of getting it if your diet is high in fat and cholesterol or your ancestry is Native American, Hispanic, or Scandinavian."", 'Cholecystitis Diagnosis The doctor will examine you, ask a few questions about your symptoms, and probably order some tests. You should be ready to: Detail when your symptoms started. Have you felt this way before? Describe how severe your pain is. Talk about whether anything makes your pain better or worse. Your doctor can tell from blood tests whether you have an infection and whether your liver is working the way it should. They may also want you to have some imaging tests . These may include: X-ray of your belly, which will show your internal organs, bones, and tissues Ultrasound , which will show your gallbladder and liver and let doctors check blood flow CT scan , which gives doctors a more detailed look at organs, muscles, and bones than an X-ray can HIDA scan, which checks how your gallbladder squeezes and\xa0if bile is blocked. You get a shot of a chemical, and then a scanner traces it as it moves through your body. PTC, which uses a dye injected into your liver to show how bile is moving through your body ERCP, which uses a long, flexible tube threaded down your throat, through your stomach , and into your small intestine. It has a light and camera at the end. This test also uses a dye to check how bile is flowing through your system.', 'Cholecystitis Treatment If you have cholecystitis, especially an acute case, you may have to spend some time in the hospital. You will have to keep your stomach empty so your gallbladder can rest. You’ll probably get fluids through a tube put into a vein. You may get pain medicine and, if doctors are concerned about infection, an antibiotic. Once treatment begins, you should start to feel better. If gallstones caused your problem, doctors may try medications to dissolve them and give you a prescription drug to keep them from forming again. A very low-fat diet may also keep them from coming back.', 'What if I Need Surgery? By far the most common treatment is to take out the gallbladder. Your doctor may decide to do the surgery right away, unless you’re too sick. If you need to wait, doctors can ease symptoms by putting a tube through your skin straight into the gallbladder and draining some bile. Surgery to remove your gallbladder, called a cholecystectomy, usually takes about an hour and is considered low-risk.', 'You’ll get general anesthesia , so you won’t be awake or feel any pain during the procedure. The doctor will make a small cut in your bellybutton to take a look inside with a special instrument. They’ll then take out the gallbladder through another small cut. You can live a healthy life without your gallbladder.', 'Cholecystitis Prevention You can take steps to lower your chances of getting gallstone and cholecystitis. They include: Lower your cholesterol. Exercise regularly. Eat a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and healthy fats . Eggs , soybeans, and peanuts are great choices. Obesity is a major risk factor for getting gallstones. Losing weight can reduce your chances, but be sure you do it in a healthy way. If you’re planning a rapid weight loss program , such as weight loss surgery , your doctor or nurse should monitor you. They may recommend bile acid pills to prevent gallstones as you lose weight.', 'Cholecystitis Complications If you don’t get treatment, your gallbladder can become infected, and some of the tissue may die. Infection can also spread to other parts of your body, including your pancreas ( pancreatitis ) and the lining of your belly ( peritonitis ). If the tubes that carry bile are damaged too much, cholecystitis can harm your liver, too. You could have repeated bouts of painful symptoms. Eventually, your gallbladder will shrink and not work as well. The condition would become a long-term, or chronic, problem.']"
4,Gallstones (Cholelithiasis): What Are They?,"['What Are Gallstones? Gallstones are pieces of solid material that form in your gallbladder, a small organ under your liver. If you have gallstones, you might hear your doctor say you have cholelithiasis. Your gallbladder stores and releases bile, a fluid made in your liver, to help in digestion. Bile also carries cholesterol and wastes such as bilirubin (which your body makes when it breaks down red blood cells) out of the liver. These things can form gallstones when they’re out of balance. Gallstones can range in size from a grain of sand to a golf ball. You can have one large stone or hundreds of little ones. Some people get a mix of big and small stones. You might not know that you have them until one or more block a bile duct , causing pain. Gallstones can be grain-sized to golf ball-sized. (Photo credit: Kateryna Kon/Dreamstime) Are gallstones dangerous? Most gallstones don’t hurt or cause health problems. These “silent gallstones” typically don’t need treatment. But you should get medical help right away if you have sudden and severe pain that lasts for hours. This can be a sign that gallstones are stuck in your bile duct, which can be life-threatening.', ""Gallstone Types The two main kinds of gallstones are: Cholesterol stones. These are usually yellow-green because they’re mostly made of undissolved cholesterol. But they can have other stuff in them, such as bilirubin or bile salts. They're the most common, making up about 80% of gallstones. Pigment stones. These are brown or black stones made mostly of bilirubin. People who get them usually have liver disease or a blood disorder such as sickle cell anemia or leukemia . Some people have a mix of cholesterol and pigment stones."", 'Gallstone Symptoms You can have gallstones and not know it. Symptoms typically happen only when one or more gallstones get stuck and block the flow of bile from your gallbladder to your small intestine (where your food goes right after it leaves your stomach). This is called a gallbladder attack or biliary colic. Some symptoms of gallstones include: Pain in the upper right side of your belly just under your ribs Pain in your lower chest, right shoulder, or back An upset stomach Nausea or vomiting Other digestive problems , including indigestion, heartburn, and gas', 'Gallstones may pass on their own. But in some cases, you might need immediate medical care. See your doctor or go to the hospital if: Your belly pain lasts more than 2 hours or is severe. You have a fever along with chills. Your skin or eyes look yellow. Not getting treatment quickly could lead to complications such as infection and inflammation. It’s important to talk to your doctor because a gallbladder attack can be similar to other health conditions that also need treatment, such as appendicitis, ulcers, pancreatitis , or more serious medical issues. Gallstone pain Your gallbladder can spasm when gallstones clog your bile ducts. You may feel a sharp cutting or stabbing pain when this happens. Your belly may hurt so bad that you have trouble catching your breath. Some people think they’re having a heart attack. Gallstone pain may also: Start shortly after you eat Wake you from sleep Last 15 minutes to several hours Come and go over weeks, months, or even years', 'Once a gallbladder attack starts, there’s nothing you can do to stop it. But gallstone pain usually goes away if the gallstone moves through the bile duct on its own. Can gallstones make you tired and dizzy? If gallstones get stuck in your bile duct and cause gallbladder spasms, your heart rate may speed up and your blood pressure may drop quickly, causing dizziness. You may feel tired if they get stuck for hours (or longer), causing inflammation or an infection that makes you sick.', 'What Causes Gallstones? Doctors aren’t sure exactly what causes gallstones, but they might happen when: There’s too much cholesterol in your bile. Your body needs bile for digestion. It usually dissolves cholesterol. But when it can’t do that, the extra cholesterol might build up and form stones. There’s too much bilirubin in your bile.\xa0Conditions such as liver disease, infections, and blood disorders can cause your liver to make too much bilirubin. Your gallbladder doesn’t empty all the way.\xa0This can make your bile very concentrated.', 'Gallstones without gallbladder You’re less likely to get gallstones if you have your gallbladder removed. But even after you have surgery to remove your gallbladder, gallstones can form in your pancreatic ducts or directly in the common bile duct (the tube that goes from your liver to your small intestine).', ""Gallstone Risk Factors You're more likely to get gallstones if you: Have a family history of them Are a woman or assigned female at birth Are over age 40 Are of Native American or Mexican descent Have obesity Have a diet high in fat and cholesterol but low in fiber Don’t get much exercise Use estrogen-based birth control or hormone replacement therapy Add estrogen to your body with feminizing hormone therapy Have diabetes Have an intestinal disease such as Crohn’s Have hemolytic anemia or cirrhosis of the liver Take medicine to lower your cholesterol Lose a lot of weight in a short time (like from weight loss surgery) Fast on a regular basis"", 'Gallstones in pregnancy During pregnancy, your body makes extra hormones called estrogen and progesterone. Extra estrogen can raise your cholesterol levels, and progesterone can slow gallbladder emptying. It’s not very common to have symptoms of gallstones during pregnancy, and it rarely causes serious problems.', 'Gallstone Diagnosis Your doctor will do a physical exam and might order tests including: Blood tests . These check for signs of infection or blockage and rule out other conditions. Abdominal ultrasound. This makes images of the inside of your body. The pictures can show gallstones outside of the bile duct or signs of gallbladder inflammation. CT scan. Specialized X-rays let your doctor see inside your body, including your gallbladder. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP). This test uses a magnetic field and pulses of radio waves to make pictures of the inside of your body, including your liver and gallbladder. Cholescintigraphy (HIDA scan). This test can check if your gallbladder is working well. Your doctor injects a harmless radioactive material that makes its way to the gallbladder. A technician can then watch its movement. This test can help distinguish between cholecystitis (inflammation of the gallbladder) and gallstones. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Your doctor runs a tube called an endoscope through your mouth down to your small intestine. They inject a dye so they can see your bile ducts on a camera in the endoscope. Endoscopic ultrasound. This test combines ultrasound and endoscopy to look for gallstones that may be in places that are hard to see with other imaging tests, such as in the common bile duct as it passes through your pancreas.', 'What do gallstones look like in the toilet? They usually look like yellowish or brownish crystals in your poop. They can be of different shapes or sizes. If they’re small enough to pass through your gallbladder and gut, you may not be able to see them in your stool.', ""Can You Pass Gallstones? Small gallstones usually pass into your small intestines and out with your stool on their own. You may not ever need to do anything about these stones if they don’t cause any symptoms, even if they keep coming back. But you’ll need medical treatment if your gallstones cause pain and block your bile ducts. If you have sickle cell or another blood disorder, your doctor may consider removing your gallbladder as a precaution, even if you don't have symptoms."", 'Gallstone Treatment You usually don’t need treatment if you don’t have symptoms, as some small gallstones can pass through your body on their own. But there are ways to reduce the chances of gallbladder complications or to treat a gallbladder attack.', 'Gallstone removal Most people who get gallstones that block their bile ducts and cause symptoms have their gallbladders taken out. Your body can function fine without a gallbladder as your liver can make bile . Your doctor will use one of two procedures to remove your gallbladder: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy . This is the most common surgery for gallstones. The surgeon works through tiny cuts (incisions). They pass a narrow tube called a laparoscope into your belly through a small cut. The tube contains a tiny light and a camera. The doctor will take out your gallbladder through another small cut using special devices. You’ll usually go home the same day. Open cholecystectomy. Your doctor makes bigger cuts in your belly to remove your gallbladder. You’ll stay in the hospital for a few days afterward. You’ll need open surgery if you have a bleeding disorder. You may also need it if you have severe gallbladder disease, have a bigger body size, or are in your last trimester of pregnancy.', 'For both types of surgery, you’ll get general anesthesia. This means you won’t be awake during the procedure. If gallstones are in your bile ducts, your doctor may use ERCP to find and remove them before or during surgery. Gallstone treatment without surgery You may not be able to have your gallbladder removed if you have any medical condition that makes surgery unsafe. In those special cases, you may need regular or lifelong treatment to remove or break up gallstones. Nonsurgical treatment options for gallstones include: Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ECRP) : Your doctor may use this procedure to remove gallstones stuck in your bile ducts. Medication .\xa0Chenodiol (Chenix) and ursodiol (Actigal) contain chemicals that dissolve small cholesterol gallstones. You may need to take these pills for years to break up the stones, and your gallstones may come back after you stop treatment. This drug treatment may cause mild diarrhea. Shock wave lithotripsy :\xa0Rarely, your doctor may use shock waves to break up your stones. They may suggest doing this alongside drug treatment with something such as ursodiol.', 'Gallstone Complications Gallstones can cause serious problems, including: Gallbladder\xa0inflammation (acute cholecystitis). This happens when a stone blocks your gallbladder so it can’t empty. It causes constant pain and fever. Your gallbladder might burst if you don’t get treatment right away. Blocked bile ducts. This can cause fever,\xa0chills, and the yellowing of your skin and\xa0eyes (jaundice). If a stone blocks the duct leading to your\xa0pancreas, that organ may become inflamed ( pancreatitis ). Blocked pancreatic ducts. If gallstones block your pancreatic duct, it can cause pancreatitis, which is swelling and inflammation of your pancreas. Infected bile ducts (acute cholangitis). A blocked duct is more likely to get infected. If the bacteria spread to your bloodstream, they can cause a dangerous condition called\xa0sepsis. Gallbladder cancer. It’s rare, but gallstones raise your risk of this kind of\xa0cancer. Gallstone surgery side effects You can live and digest food without a gallbladder, and most people feel fine when they have it removed. But there’s a chance you could notice some side effects afterward. Most are mild and get better over time.', 'Side effects of gallbladder surgery include: Loose or more frequent stools Gas Bloating Change in bowel habits You’re unlikely to have serious problems after gallbladder surgery, but all medical procedures come with risks. The most common one with this treatment is bile duct injury , which can lead to an infection. You may need another surgery to fix your bile duct if this happens to you.', 'How to Prevent Gallstones Genes play a role in who gets gallstones, and you might not be able to prevent them. But some lifestyle changes might help lower your risk, such as: Eat a nutritious diet with plenty of fiber from vegetables and whole grains, along with unsaturated fats from nuts, olive oil, and fish. Limit or avoid highly processed foods, sugary foods and drinks, and saturated and trans fats. Get regular exercise . Aim for at least 30 minutes per day, 5 days a week. If you’re overweight or have obesity, talk to your doctor about how to get to a healthy weight. Although obesity is a risk factor, avoid diets that make you lose a lot of weight in a short time. Talk to your doctor about your risk of gallstones if you get weight loss surgery. If you’re a woman or someone assigned female at birth who’s at a high risk of gallstones (for example, because of your family history, obesity, or another health condition), talk to your doctor about whether you should be cautious about using hormonal birth control or hormone replacement therapy.', 'Gallstones diet There isn’t one food that’ll prevent gallstones, but you may be less likely to get them if you: Eat frequently. Your gallbladder stores bile from your liver, but it empties when you eat. Doing this regularly may prevent the formation of gallstones in people who are prone to developing them. Fill up on plant foods . Fiber can help flush excess cholesterol out of your body. High-fiber foods include fruits, vegetables, beans, and whole grains such as brown rice, oatmeal, and whole-wheat bread. Choose unsaturated and omega-3 fats. People who eat more monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats (olive oil, canola oil, nuts) and omega-3 fatty acids (flaxseed, fish, and fish oil) are less likely to get gallstones. Limit fast food and red meat. Both are high in saturated fat. This kind of fat can raise your low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, which may raise your risk of gallstones. Cut back on refined carbs. Foods such as white rice, white bread, and white tortillas are usually low in fiber and other nutrients. Limit sugar. People who eat a lot of sweet foods and drinks are more likely to get gallstones. This might happen because sugar raises your blood sugar and causes your liver to release more bile into your gallbladder.']"
5,Multifocal Motor Neuropathy,"[""What Is Multifocal Motor Neuropathy? Multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) is a disease that affects your body's motor nerves. Those are the nerves that control your muscles. The condition makes it hard for them to send the electrical signals that move your body, which makes your hands and arms feel weak. They’ll also twitch and cramp . MMN is not life-threatening, and, in most cases, treatments can make the muscles stronger. The disease can get worse slowly, and after a while, you may have a hard time doing daily tasks, like typing or getting dressed. But for many people, symptoms may be so mild that they don't need treatment at all. You may be able to work and stay active for many years after your diagnosis. Most people are diagnosed with MMN in their 40s and 50s, although adults from ages 20 to 80 can find out they have the disease."", 'Causes No one knows what causes MMN. Scientists do know it’s an autoimmune disease , meaning your immune system mistakenly attacks your nerve cells as if they were invaders. Researchers are studying the disease to try to find out why it happens.', 'Symptoms If you have MMN, you’ll most likely notice the first symptoms in your hands and lower arms. Your muscles may feel weak and cramp up or twitch in a way you can’t control. It may start in specific parts of the arm or hand, like the wrist or finger. Usually the symptoms are more severe on one side of your body. The disease may eventually affect your legs. MMN isn’t painful, and you’ll still be able to feel with your hands and arms because your sensory nerves are not affected. But your symptoms will slowly get worse as you get older.', ""Getting a Diagnosis Doctors often mistake MMN for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. They have similar symptoms, like twitching. Unlike ALS, though, MMN is treatable. Your doctor may tell you to see a neurologist, a specialist who treats problems with the nervous system. They will give you a physical exam and\xa0also ask questions about your symptoms, like: Which muscles are giving you trouble? Is it worse on one side of your body? How long have you been feeling this way? Do you have any numbness or tingling? Does anything make your symptoms better? What makes them worse? The doctor will do some nerve and blood tests to rule out other conditions that might cause your symptoms. They may do: A nerve conduction study (NCS). This test measures how fast electrical signals travel through your nerves. Usually, your doctor will put two sensors on the skin over one of your nerves: one to transmit a small electric shock and the other to record the activity. The doctor will repeat the test on other nerves if they think that more than one is involved. A needle electromyography (EMG). Your doctor will put electrodes on your arms. The electrodes have small needles, which go into your muscle, and they’re attached by wires to a machine that can measure the electrical activity in your muscles. Your doctor will ask you to slowly flex and relax your arms so the machine can record the activity. The doctor can do this test at the same time as the NCS. A blood test to look for GM1 antibodies, part of your body’s immune system. Some people with MMN have higher levels of them. If you do have a lot of these antibodies, chances are you have the disease. You might have MNN even if you don't have a lot of the antibodies, though."", ""Questions for Your Doctor How will MMN affect me? Do I need treatment? What kinds are available? How will they make me feel? Will I be able to work? What happens if the treatment doesn't help? Are there any clinical trials I can join? Are there any activities I won't be able to do?"", ""Treatment If your symptoms are very mild, you may not need any treatment. If you do need treatment, your doctor will probably prescribe a medication called intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIg ). You’ll get the drug directly into one of your veins through an IV. You’ll usually get it in a doctor's office, although you can learn to do it at home. If IVIg works, you should feel your muscle strength improve within 3 to 6 weeks. The effects will wear off over time, though, so you’ll need to keep having the treatment. People usually have it once a month, but it may be more or less often depending on your condition."", ""IVIg doesn't have many side effects, but it is expensive. Doctors are testing ways to give it directly through the skin like a regular shot, but this method isn’t available for everyone. If IVIg doesn't work, your doctor may try a drug called cyclophosphamide ( Cytoxan ), which is also used to treat certain types of cancer . This drug controls symptoms by turning down your immune system. Unlike immunoglobulin, cyclophosphamide can have bad side effects, so doctors try not to use it."", 'Taking Care of Yourself If you get treatment for MMN early, you’re more likely to have few symptoms or long-term problems. Stick to your treatment plan, and talk to your doctor about any changes in how you’re feeling. If you have trouble with certain activities, you may want to see an occupational or physical therapist. They can help you keep your muscles strong and show you how to do daily tasks more easily if your muscles are bothering you.', 'What to Expect Many people with MMN can continue most or at least some of their normal activities. The disease can get worse for some people and keep them from doing daily tasks. The kind of problems you have depend on which of your muscles are affected. If your hand muscles are weak, you may have trouble eating, typing, writing, or buttoning clothes. If your leg muscles are affected, you could have trouble walking. Some people with severe MMN have trouble in all these areas.', 'Getting Support To learn more about multifocal motor neuropathy, visit the web sites of the Neuropathy Action Foundation , the Neuropathy Association , or the GBS-CIDP (Guillain-Barre Syndrome-Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy] Foundation International .']"
6,What Is a Ganglion Cyst?,"['What Is a Ganglion Cyst? A ganglion cyst is a small sac of fluid that forms over a joint or tendon (tissue that connects muscle to bone). Inside the cyst is a thick, sticky, clear, colorless, jellylike material. Depending on the size, cysts may feel firm or spongy. Ganglion cysts, also known as Bible cysts, most commonly show up on the back of the hand at the wrist joint but can also develop on the palm side of the wrist. They can also show up in other areas, but those are less common.', ""Ganglion Cyst Symptoms Most ganglion cysts show up as a soft bump or mass that changes size but doesn’t move. They're often painless. Swelling may appear over time or suddenly. Other symptoms of a ganglion cyst include: A bump that goes away and comes back One large cyst or many smaller cysts Some degree of pain , especially after an injury or trauma from repeated movement Long-lasting pain that gets worse when you move the affected joint Pressure on nerves that causes tingling or numbness Weakness in the affected finger if the cyst is connected to a tendon"", ""Types of Ganglion Cysts Ganglion cyst on the wrist Ganglion cysts on the back of the wrist are more common in young adults and usually disappear without treatment. Ganglion cysts on the front of the wrist usually show up in younger people or older people with arthritis. Ganglion cyst on a finger These cysts are usually found on the fingertip, just below the cuticle, where they're called mucous cysts. These are more common in people who are middle-aged or older. Ganglion cyst on the thumb These cysts are rarer than those on the fingers. They can cause thumb triggering -- locking or catching when you move your thumb -- as well as pain and stiffness in the joint. Ganglion cyst on an elbow Ganglion cysts on the elbows are rare but can happen. They can restrict joint movement and cause pain that comes and goes. Ganglion cyst on a foot Ganglion cysts can grow on the top of your foot or on your ankle. These usually result from bone spurs (bony outgrowths) or from damage to joints or tendons caused by arthritis."", ""V olar ganglion cyst A volar ganglion cyst shows up as a pea-sized bump on the palm of your hand or at the base of your finger. These cysts can cause pain when you grip objects. Volar ganglion cysts tend to appear suddenly and don't get bigger or smaller. About half of the time, they disappear without treatment."", ""Ganglion Cyst Causes Doctors don't know exactly what causes ganglion cysts. Injury or damage may cause the tissue of the joint to break down, forming small cysts that later create a larger mass. A flaw in the joint capsule or tendon sheath (layers of connective tissue that allow tendons to move smoothly over bones) also may cause the joint tissue to bulge."", ""Ganglion Cyst Risk Factors Ganglion cysts are more common: In people aged 15-40 In women (or those assigned female at birth) If you've had an injury to your wrist or finger If you do repetitive work with your wrists or hands If you have arthritis If you have inflammation of your tendons or joints"", ""Ganglion Cyst Diagnosis See your doctor, even if you have a bump without other symptoms. A physical exam is often all that is needed to diagnose a ganglion cyst, but your doctor may suggest other tests. Your doctor may use a needle to draw out and analyze fluid in the cyst (known as a needle aspiration). You may also have an ultrasound , a test that uses sound waves that bounce off tissues to form a picture. It can determine whether the bump is fluid-filled (cystic) or if it's solid, which may mean it's a tumor. An ultrasound can also detect whether an artery or blood vessel is causing the lump. Your doctor may send you to a hand surgeon if the bump is large, solid, or involves a blood vessel (artery). An MRI , magnetic resonance imaging, uses sound waves and a magnetic field to make an image of the inside your body where the cyst is located. An MRI can help your doctor see if the bump is a cyst or a tumor and if there's ligament damage. An X-ray doesn't show cysts, but it may be used to rule out other issues such as a tumor or arthritis."", 'Ganglion Cyst Treatment A ganglion cyst doesn’t need emergency treatment unless caused by a serious injury or damage. A routine check by either your doctor or a specialist in bones and joints (an orthopedist) is often enough.', ""Self-care at home If your cyst isn’t bothering you, your doctor may tell you to keep an eye on it for any major changes. Many cysts disappear without treatment and never cause major problems. In the past, some people used a heavy book (such as a Bible) to physically smash these cysts. Doctors don't recommend this because it hasn't been shown to keep the ganglion cysts from returning and could cause further injury. Medical treatment Your doctor may recommend one of these treatments if your cyst bothers you: Aspiration. In this procedure, your doctor uses a needle to draw the liquid material out of the cyst. Then, they inject a steroid compound (anti-inflammatory) into the area, which is put in a splint to keep it from moving. Aspiration doesn't remove the link between the cyst and its tendon sheath or joint, so it will likely return. Surgery. With this procedure, known as a ganglionectomy, the doctor uses a camera and small tools (arthroscopic surgery) to remove the cyst and the area around it -- called the stalk -- that attaches it to the joint. If the doctor can't get to the cyst through minimally invasive surgery, they'll need to make a larger cut and do open surgery. Both are outpatient procedures, so you should go home the same day. Recovery takes 2-6 weeks. Your doctor may recommend surgery if aspiration doesn't help and the cyst causes pain, interferes with function (especially when your dominant hand is involved), or causes numbness or tingling in your hand or fingers. The surgery is usually successful, and you'll have less than a 15% chance that the cyst will return."", ""Next Steps After you've been diagnosed with a ganglion cyst and have chosen to have treatment, the follow-up will vary based on what you've decided to do. After aspiration, your doctor may ask you to start moving the joint soon after the procedure. After surgery, your joint is usually splinted for 7-10 days. A splint is a hard wrap that keeps you from moving your joint. Studies show that splinting for a long time doesn't really help, so your doctor may encourage you to use the joint soon afterward. Your doctor may ask you to return for a checkup after your surgery and will decide if you need physical or occupational therapy . Follow-up care will be based on your personal needs."", ""Ganglion Cyst Prevention Because we don't know what causes ganglion cysts, we don't know how to prevent them. Doctors recommend that you get them diagnosed and treated promptly."", ""Ganglion Cyst Outlook Ganglion cysts rarely cause major complications. Because they can go away on their own, or after a simple needle aspiration or minor surgery, there is a good chance that you'll have a full recovery. However, because ganglion cysts may come back after any of these treatments, a single treatment may not be enough.""]"
7,Tay-Sachs Disease,"['What Is Tay-Sachs Disease? Tay-Sachs disease is a rare, fatal disorder most commonly diagnosed in babies around 6 months of age. There’s no cure for the disease, but scientists have a good idea of what causes it, how it worsens, and how to use genetic testing to screen for it early in pregnancy . Researchers are working to make advances in gene\xa0therapy or bone marrow transplants that they hope will allow treatment of Tay-Sachs in the future', 'Tay-Sachs Disease Symptoms A baby born with Tay-Sachs grows like they should until 3 to 6 months of age. Around this time, parents might notice that their baby ’s development starts to slow and their muscles weaken. Over time, the disease causes more symptoms in babies, including: A loss of motor skills such as turning over, sitting, and crawling A very strong reaction to loud noises Trouble focusing on objects or following them with their eyes Cherry-red spots, which can be identified with an eye exam, in the eyes', 'By age 2, most children with Tay-Sachs have started getting more serious problems. They can include: Swallowing and breathing issues that keep getting worse Seizures Loss of mental function, hearing, and sight Paralysis Past age 3, there are few visible changes in children with Tay-Sachs, but their nervous system continues to get worse, often leading to death by age 5.', 'Tay-Sachs Disease Causes and Risk Factors Defects in a gene called HEXA cause Tay-Sachs. (You can think of genes as “coding” that your parents pass along to you. Genes are in your cells, and they set your body’s traits -- everything from your eye color and blood type to your sex.) Most people have two healthy versions of this HEXA gene, which gives instructions to your body to make an enzyme (a type of protein ) known as Hex-A. This enzyme prevents the buildup of a fatty substance called GM2 ganglioside in your brain and spinal cord. Some people have just one healthy copy of the gene, and they still make enough Hex-A protein\xa0to keep the brain and spinal cord healthy. But babies born with Tay-Sachs disease got a changed copy of the gene from both parents, so they don’t make any Hex-A\xa0protein. This is what makes them so sick.', 'Over time, GM2 ganglioside builds up\xa0in their nervous system and starts to cause damage. The disease is very rare. It affects only about 1 in every 112,000 live births. Anyone can be a carrier of a HEXA mutation, meaning they have just one defective copy of the HEXA gene. But the chance of inheriting the disease is higher in certain groups because of a higher rate of carriers. About 1 in every 27 Jewish people in the United States is a carrier. Non-Jewish French Canadians living near the St. Lawrence River in Canada and in the Cajun community of Louisiana also have a higher incidence of Tay-Sachs. If both parents are carriers of Tay-Sachs disease, there is a 25% chance that any child they have will get the disease.', 'Tay-Sachs Disease Diagnosis Pregnant women can have a test to find out whether their unborn babies have the problem that causes Tay-Sachs. If the tests don’t find any Hex-A protein, the baby has Tay-Sachs. If the tests find Hex-A, the baby doesn’t have the disease.', 'These tests include: Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) . Your doctor takes a\xa0 small sample of the placenta with a needle or small tube and analyzes it. They can do this between the 10th and 12th weeks of pregnancy. Amniocentesis . The doctor uses a needle to take a sample of the amniotic fluid that surrounds the baby and tests it. To diagnose Tay-Sachs in a baby after it’s born: Your doctor will ask you about your baby’s symptoms and your family history. They’ll do a blood test to check Hex-A levels. The doctor will check the baby’s eyes. A cherry-red spot in the back of the eyes is a sign of Tay-Sachs. If it’s there, you may need to take your baby to specialists, such as a pediatric neurologist and an opthalmologist, for more tests.', 'Tay-Sachs Disease Treatment Some of the specialists, treatments, and programs you might consider include: Speech-language pathologists . They can provide ways to help your baby keep the suck-swallow reflex going as well as help you figure out when it is time to consider a feeding tube for your little one. Neurologists . These specialists can help you manage your baby ’s seizures with medication . Respiratory health . Specialists such as pediatricians and pulmonologists (doctors who treat lung and breathing problems ) can recommend ways for parents to lower their child’s chance of lung infections. Chest physiotherapy (CPT) . Therapy to tap on the chest wall can help break up mucus in the lungs so your child can cough it up. Feeding tubes . Your child may have trouble swallowing or may have breathing problems that include inhaling food or liquid into their lungs while eating. You can insert a feeding tube through your child’s nose into their stomach each time. Or a doctor may put in a tube during surgery. Play and stimulation . You can help your child interact with the world through music , scents, and textures. Massages . These can relax your baby. Palliative and hospice care .\xa0These programs help manage quality of life for children with Tay-Sachs and their families.', 'Tay-Sachs Disease Prevention You can have a blood\xa0test that analyzes your genes or the levels of the Hex-A protein in your blood to tell you whether you are a Tay-Sachs carrier. If two people planning to have children find out that they’re both carriers, a genetic counselor can help them review the options for lowering the chances of having a baby with Tay-Sachs.', ""Late-Onset Tay-Sachs Disease An even rarer type of Tay-Sachs is called “late onset” or “adult onset.” It can be hard to diagnose. Like the version of the disease that affects infants, Tay-Sachs that starts later in life is caused by changes in the HEXA gene. Symptoms might start to appear anywhere from the teen years to adulthood. Early symptoms often include clumsiness, trouble balancing, and muscle weakness in the legs. People with it may also have mental health issues. This form of the disease affects each person differently. Late-onset Tay-Sachs doesn't\xa0always mean a shorter life span.""]"
8,Ganser Syndrome,"['Ganser syndrome is a rare and somewhat controversial diagnosis.\xa0 It was first described by Siegbert Ganser in 1898 and is sometimes called ""prison psychosis "" because it was first observed in prisoners.\xa0With this condition,\xa0a person deliberately and consciously acts as if they have\xa0a physical or mental illness when they\xa0are not really sick. People with Ganser syndrome mimic behavior that is typical of a mental illness, such as schizophrenia . People with factitious disorders act this way because of an inner need to be seen as ill or injured -- not to achieve a clear benefit, such as financial gain. They are even willing to undergo painful or risky tests and operations in order to obtain the sympathy and special attention given to people who are truly ill. Factitious disorders are technically considered mental illnesses because they are associated with severe emotional difficulties.', 'What Are the Symptoms of Ganser Syndrome? People with Ganser syndrome have short-term episodes of odd behavior similar to that shown by people with other serious mental illnesses. The person may appear confused, make absurd statements, and report hallucinations such as the experience of sensing things that are not there or hearing voices. A classic symptom of Ganser syndrome is vorbeireden . This is when the person gives nonsense answers to simple questions. In addition, a person with this condition may report physical problems such as an inability to move part of the body, called ""hysterical paralysis."" Loss of memory (amnesia) of the events that occurred during an episode is common.', 'What Causes Ganser Syndrome? Little is known about this unusual disorder, but it is believed to be a reaction to extreme stress. There are also physical problems that may cause the symptoms of Ganser syndrome such as alcoholism , head injury , and stroke. Most people with this condition\xa0also have a personality disorder, usually antisocial personality disorder or histrionic personality disorder . Antisocial personality disorder is characterized by irresponsible and aggressive behavior that often involves a disregard for others and an inability to abide by society\'s rules. People with antisocial personality disorder are sometimes referred to as ""sociopaths"" or ""psychopaths."" For people with histrionic personality disorder, their self-esteem depends on the approval of others and does not arise from a true feeling of self-worth. They have an overwhelming desire to be noticed, and often behave dramatically or inappropriately to get attention.', 'How Common Is Ganser Syndrome? Ganser syndrome is very rare. It is more common in men than in women and most often occurs in the late teens and early adult years.', ""How Is Ganser Syndrome Diagnosed? Diagnosing Ganser syndrome is challenging. Doctors must rule out any possible physical problems, such as stroke or head injury, or other psychological conditions as the cause of the symptoms before considering a diagnosis of Ganser syndrome. If the doctor finds no physical reason for the symptoms, they may refer the person to a psychiatrist or psychologist , mental health professionals who are specially trained to diagnose and treat mental illnesses. Psychiatrists and psychologists use specially designed interviews and assessment tools to evaluate a person for psychiatric conditions. The doctor bases their diagnosis on the use of these tools as well as the exclusion of other physical or mental illnesses and their observation of the patient's attitude and behavior."", ""How Is Ganser Syndrome Treated? It is difficult to predict whether and when symptoms of Ganser syndrome are likely to go away. This is partly because people with Ganser Syndrome often present with fake symptoms not just simply in response to a stressful event, but because the condition often reflects someone's limited ability to cope effectively with stresses when they occur. Supportive psychotherapy (a type of counseling), and monitoring for safety and a return of symptoms are the main treatments for Ganser syndrome. Medication usually is not generally used, unless the person also suffers from depression , anxiety , or psychosis."", 'What Is the Outlook for People With Ganser Syndrome? It is difficult to predict whether and when symptoms of Ganser syndrome are likely to go away.\xa0The likelihood for recovery from Ganser syndrome can vary greatly depending on whether the symptoms arose suddenly in response to a stressful experience or reflect a more long-term pattern.', 'Can Ganser Syndrome Be Prevented? There is no known way to prevent this condition.']"
9,Understanding Colorectal Cancer -- The Basics,"['What Is Colorectal Cancer? Inside your abdominal cavity is the long, tubular digestive tract. The second part of this tube -- the large intestine -- is composed of the colon , which stretches 4 feet to 6 feet, and the rectum, which is only 4 inches to 6 inches long. The inner lining of this ""colorectal tube"" can be a fertile breeding ground for small tumors, called polyps (Figure 1). About a quarter of all adults in the U.S. older than age 50 will have at least one colorectal polyp. Most colorectal cancers develop from polyps in glandular tissue of the intestinal lining. Most polyps are benign, but at least one type is known to be precancerous. These are called adenomatous polyps. The size of the polyp correlates with the development of cancer . Polyps less than 1 centimeter in size have a slightly greater than a 1% chance of becoming cancer , but those 2 centimeters or greater have a 40% chance of transforming into cancer . Overall, the incidence is about 5%. Most colorectal cancers develop from polyps in glandular tissue of the intestinal lining.', 'If colorectal cancer is diagnosed and treated early while the tumor is still localized, the disease is highly curable, with five-year survival rates of about 90%. If the tumor continues to grow, cancer can spread directly through the bowel wall to surrounding lymph nodes, tissues, and organs, as well as into the bloodstream. Once the cancer spreads to lymph nodes or other organs, successful treatment becomes more difficult. Depending on how advanced the disease is, five-year survival rates range from 11% to 87%. Cancers of the colon and rectum are common, with approximately 135,000 cases diagnosed each year. Like many cancers, colorectal cancer is of particular concern for people older than age 50. Although diagnosis is often possible at an early stage, many people delay seeking medical care because they are embarrassed or fearful of symptoms related to their bowels. Risk increases significantly after age 50 and continues to increase with age.', ""What Causes Colorectal Cancer? The exact cause of colorectal cancer is not known. But there are several risk factors for the disease. Other diseases . Colorectal cancer is strongly associated with certain other diseases. Those people considered at high risk include anyone with a personal or family history of colon polyps or colon cancer, inflammatory disease of the colon such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease , and cancers of the pancreas , breast , ovaries, or uterus. Heredity . As with any cancer, susceptibility to colorectal cancer is at least partly determined by genetic makeup . A few people inherit medical conditions, such as familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), MYH-associated polyposis (MAP), Gardner's syndrome, Turcot's syndrome, Peutz-Jagher's syndrome, juvenile polyposis, and Cowden's disease. In all of these disorders, colon polyps develop at an early age, and unless treated, these people are at high risk of developing colorectal cancer. Hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer . The disease extends from generation to generation and causes a person to develop colon cancer. This disease is associated with other cancers including endometrial, ovarian, stomach, small intestine, pancreas, kidney, ureter, brain, and bile duct. Diet . Diet also contributes to the risk of colorectal cancer, although the cause-and-effect relationship is still unclear. People whose diets are high in fruits and vegetables seem to have a reduced risk. Many studies implicate animal fat and protein as promoters of colorectal cancer, although researchers are cautious about drawing any definite conclusions. Some studies show that regularly eating red meat, which is rich in saturated fat and protein, increases risk, while others find no connection. Some scientists note that fat is the main culprit, while others suspect protein. Others contend that it's not the fat and protein themselves, but the way they are cooked. They note that fats and protein cooked at high temperatures -- especially when broiled and barbecued -- can produce a host of potentially carcinogenic substances linked to colorectal cancer. Chemical exposure . Heavy exposure to certain chemicals, including chlorine -- which in small amounts is commonly used to purify drinking water -- may increase the risk of colorectal cancer. Exposure to asbestos is thought to be potentially harmful because it has been implicated in causing formation of polyps in the colon. History of certain types of surgery. Surgeries such as ureterosigmoidostomy, which is performed in the treatment of bladder cancer , and a cholecsytecomy (the removal of the gallbladder ). Some studies show surgery of the bladder may lead to a risk for colon cancer development, but other studies do not. History of colon cancer. A prior case of colon cancer increases the risk of a second colon cancer, especially if the first cancer was diagnosed before the age of 60. Lifestyle. Smoking and alcohol intake of more than 4 drinks per week increases the risk of developing colon cancer. Family history . Those with a first-degree relative with colorectal cancer have an increased risk of the disease. The risk increases if more than one first-degree relative has colon cancer. Radiation . Prior radiation increases the risk of cancer to the radiated tissue only.""]"
10,Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I),"['What Is MPS I? MPS I stands for mucopolysaccharidosis type I. It starts in childhood. You can\'t ""catch"" it -- it comes from your genes. People with MPS I can\'t make a specific protein called alpha-L iduronidase, which is needed to break down sugars. These sugars build up in cells and cause damage throughout the body. People who have this disease can have problems with how their bodies grow and work, as well as trouble with thinking and learning. They might look different, too. Many people with milder MPS I can go to school and eventually work and have families. And even for people with more severe MPS I, there are treatments to help ease their symptoms and slow down the disease. Because it affects people in so many different ways, doctors used to separate MPS I into groups: Hurler, Hurler-Scheie, and Scheie syndromes. Now they talk about a range between two forms: Severe Attenuated, or less severe', 'Causes MPS I is passed down through families. But you get it only when both parents give you a broken gene. If you get one normal gene and one ""bad"" gene, you won\'t have symptoms of MPS I. You could pass the gene to your children, though.', ""Symptoms Many babies with MPS I don't show any signs of the disease at first. For those with less severe MPS I, symptoms show up later in childhood. People with this form, attenuated MPS I, probably can make a tiny bit of the protein, which is why their symptoms are milder and the disease moves very slowly. Children who have the severe form usually start to have symptoms while they're still infants. They're often big when they're born and grow quickly for a year, but then stop by the time they're 3. They might never grow taller than 4 feet. They also tend to look similar: Shorter than average, with stocky build Large head, bulging forehead Thick lips, widely spaced teeth, and large tongue Short, flat nose with wide nostrils Thick, tough skin Short, broad hands with curving fingers Knock-knees and walking on toes Curved spine"", 'MPS I can show up in a lot of different ways: Eye problems , including cloudy eyes and a hard time seeing in bright light or at night Bad breath , dental problems Weak neck Breathing problems and airway infections, including runny nose, sinus infections, and sleep apnea Ear infections and hearing loss Numbness and tingling in fingers or feet Heart disease Stiff joints and trouble moving Hernias, which look like a bulge around the belly button or in the groin Diarrhea Enlarged liver or spleen', ""Your child might not have all of those symptoms. People with the milder form of the disease usually don't have as many physical problems. They typically have a normal intelligence and can do many things other people do. The more severe the disease, the more of these problems your child is likely to have. Severe MPS I can also affect intelligence and learning. Some kids might lose their ability to speak."", 'Getting a Diagnosis Because it\'s a rare disease, doctors rule out other medical conditions first. Your doctor might ask: What symptoms have you noticed? When did you first see them? Do they come and go? Does anything make them better? Or worse? Has anyone in your family had similar symptoms in the past? If the doctors can\'t find another explanation for your child\'s symptoms, they\'ll test for MPS I by checking for: A lot of a specific sugar in their urine How active the ""missing"" protein is in their blood or skin cells', ""After doctors are sure it's MPS I, it's a good idea to let your extended family know about the gene problem, too. If you are pregnant,\xa0know you are a carrier of the gene, and already have a child with MPS I, you can find out whether the baby you're carrrying is affected. Talk to your doctor about testing."", ""Questions for Your Doctor Will my child's symptoms change over time? If so, how? What treatments are best for them now? Do these treatments have side effects? What can I do about them? Is there a clinical trial that could help? How do we check their progress? Are there new symptoms I should watch for? How often do we need to see you? Are there other specialists we should see? If I have more children, how likely are they to have MPS I?"", ""Treatment Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) uses a drug called laronidase (Aldurazyme), a man-made version of the missing protein. It has changed the outlook for many kids with MPS I. It can relieve most symptoms and slow the progress of the disease, although it doesn't help treat symptoms from the brain, like problems with thinking or learning."", ""Another option may be a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), in which doctors put new cells into your child's body that might make the protein their body is missing. These cells often come from bone marrow or umbilical cord blood. When children get a transplant before they're 2 years old, they might be able to learn better. But HSCT can't fix bone or eye problems. Work with a doctor who specializes in lysosomal storage diseases, or LSDs. Depending on what symptoms your child has, you might need to see other specialists, too. Often they'll include a cardiologist, who focuses on the heart , and an eye doctor."", ""Taking Care of Your Child Encourage your child to be independent and make friends. Kids with MPS I are often well-liked and enjoy being with others. Include them in safe family activities. Most important, be positive. Keep an open mind about other people's reactions when you introduce your child to them. They might not know what to say, possibly because they don't want to pry or offend or embarrass you. When people ask about your child, tell them about their condition and what they can and can't do. Also mention your child's interests, their curiosity, and their personality."", ""Talk to the staff at your child's school to come up with an individualized education program (IEP). Your child might need one-on-one attention in the classroom, a special desk, or other adjustments. To protect their necks, kids with MPS I should avoid contact sports, gymnastics, trampolines, and similar activities. Look for ways to change how your home is set up to make it easier for your child to move around and do things on their own. Make time for yourself and your family, too. It's OK to have someone take over caregiving duties for a while. Step back and take a break to rest and recharge."", ""What to Expect Although there is no cure for MPS I, treatments can improve the quality of life -- especially when started early. They slow the disease and help stop damage before it starts. Most kids who have less severe MPS I can go to school with other children. They'll go through puberty and can have kids of their own. Adults are protected by the Americans with Disabilities Act, so they might be able to work and live on their own. When the disease is more severe, it moves faster. Children with the most severe form usually get worse very quickly, and they might not live to be teenagers. Special care focuses on easing pain and offering support, so your child and your family can have the best quality of life."", 'Getting Support To learn more about MPS I, visit the National MPS Society website .

11,The Digestive System and Gas,"[""Gas is a normal result of the foods you eat and swallowing air. As your digestive system does its thing, it makes gas. Usually, you get rid of gas through your mouth (burping) or through your anus (flatulence). People gas about 20 times a day. It’s an ordinary occurrence, but it can be painful and embarrassing. You make gas in two ways: when you swallow air, and when the bacteria in your large intestine help digest your food. Undigested food moves from the small intestine to the large intestine. Once it gets there, the bacteria go to work, making hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and methane, which then leave your body. Not everyone will get gas from the same foods. You also swallow air when you eat and drink. This helps make gas. You usually release swallowed air by burping it. Whatever isn't released by burping goes into the small or large intestine, where it’s released as flatulence."", 'Which Foods Are Most Likely to Cause Gas? You’re most likely to get gas by eating carbs, which are found in foods like: Beans Vegetables (especially broccoli, cabbage, and onions) Fruits Dairy products Whole-grain foods Soft drinks Fruit drinks', 'What Are the Symptoms of Gas? In addition to burping and flatulence, you may feel bloated. You could also have pain in your belly or sides. That pain could be mistaken for something else, like a heart attack or appendicitis.', ""Could Gas Be a Sign of a Medical Problem?

12,Stomach Cancer,"['Stomach cancer begins when cancer cells form in the inner lining of your stomach . These cells can grow into a tumor. Also called gastric cancer, the disease usually grows slowly over many years.\xa0Stomach cancer is most often seen in people in their late 60s through 80s. Almost all stomach cancers (about 95%) start in the glandular tissue that lines the stomach. The tumor may spread along the stomach wall or may grow directly through the wall and shed cells into the bloodstream or lymphatic system. Once beyond the stomach, cancer can spread to other organs. Stomach cancers are classified according to the type of tissue they start in. Adenocarcinomas -- the most common -- start in the glandular stomach lining. Lymphomas develop from lymphocytes, a type of blood cell involved in the immune system. Sarcomas involve the connective tissue (muscle, fat, or blood vessels). Other types include carcinoid, small cell carcinoma , and squamous cell carcinoma . Metastatic cancers from breast cancer , melanoma, and other primary sites of cancer are also seen in the stomach. If you know the symptoms of stomach cancer, you and your doctor may be able to spot it early, when it’s easiest to treat.', 'What Causes Stomach Cancer? Scientists don’t know exactly what makes cancer cells start growing in the stomach. But they do know a few things that can raise your risk for the disease. One of them is infection with a common bacteria, H. pylori , which causes ulcers. Inflammation in your gut called gastritis, a certain type of long-lasting anemia called pernicious anemia, and growths in your stomach called polyps also can make you more likely to get cancer. Other things that seem to play a role in raising the risk include: Smoking Being overweight or obese A diet high in smoked, pickled, or salty foods Drinking alcohol regularly Stomach surgery for an ulcer Type-A blood Epstein-Barr virus infection Certain genes Working in coal, metal, timber, or rubber industries Exposure to asbestos Family history of gastric cancer Hereditary factors such as familial adenomatous polyposis, hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (Lynch syndrome), and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome', 'What Are the Symptoms of Stomach Cancer? Early on, stomach cancer may cause: Indigestion Feeling bloated after you eat a meal Heartburn Slight nausea Loss of appetite', 'Just having indigestion or heartburn after a meal doesn’t mean you have cancer . But if you feel these symptoms a lot, talk to your doctor. They\xa0can see if you have other risk factors and test you to look for any problems. As stomach tumors grow, you may have more serious symptoms, such as: Stomach pain Blood in your stool Vomiting Weight loss for no reason Trouble swallowing Yellowish eyes or skin Swelling in your stomach Constipation or diarrhea Weakness or feeling tired Heartburn', ""How Is Stomach Cancer Diagnosed? Doctors typically don't do routine screening for stomach cancer. That's mainly because it's not that common, so getting extra tests often isn't helpful.\xa0 In fact, the number of stomach cancer cases has declined over the past 60 years. If you're at higher risk for it though, talk to your doctor to see how to keep an eye out for it. You may get some of the same tests that you would get if you had symptoms and were looking for a diagnosis."", ""To find out if you have stomach cancer, your doctor starts with a physical exam . They'll also ask about your medical history to see if you have any risk factors for stomach cancer or any family members who’ve had it. Then, they might give you some tests, including: Blood tests to look for signs of cancer in your body. Upper endoscopy . Your doctor will put a thin, flexible tube with a small camera down your throat to look into your stomach. Upper GI series test . You’ll drink a chalky liquid with a substance called barium. The fluid coats your stomach and makes it show up more clearly on X-rays. CT scan. This is a powerful X-ray that makes detailed pictures of the inside of your body. Biopsy. Your doctor takes a small piece of tissue from your stomach to look at under a microscope for signs of cancer cells. They\xa0might do this during an endoscopy."", ""What Are Stomach Cancer Treatments? Many treatments can fight stomach cancer. The one you and your doctor choose will depend on how long you've had the disease or how much it has spread in your body, called the stage of your cancer: Stage 0. This is when the inside lining of your stomach has a group of unhealthy cells that may turn into cancer. Surgery usually cures it. Your doctor may remove part or all of your stomach, as well as nearby lymph nodes -- small organs that are part of your body's germ-fighting system. Stage I. At this point, you have a tumor in your stomach's lining, and it may have spread into your lymph nodes. As with stage 0, you'll likely have surgery to remove part or all of your stomach and nearby lymph nodes. You might also get chemotherapy or chemoradiation. These treatments can be used before surgery to shrink the tumor and afterward to kill any cancer that's left. Chemotherapy uses drugs to attack cancer cells. Chemoradiation is chemo plus radiation therapy, which destroys cancer cells with beams of high energy."", ""Stage II. Cancer has spread into deeper layers of the stomach and maybe into nearby lymph nodes. Surgery to remove part or all of your stomach, as well as nearby lymph nodes, is still the main treatment. You're very likely to get chemo or chemoradiation beforehand, and you might get one of them after, too. Stage III. The cancer may now be in all layers of the stomach, as well as other organs close by, like the spleen or colon. Or, it may be smaller but reach deep into your lymph nodes. You usually have surgery to remove your entire stomach, along with chemo or chemoradiation. This can sometimes cure it. If not, it can at least help with symptoms. If you're too sick for surgery, you may get chemo, radiation, or both, depending on what your body can handle. Stage IV. In this last stage, cancer has spread far and wide to organs like the liver, lungs, or brain. It's much harder to treat, but your doctor can help manage it and give you some relief from symptoms."", 'If the tumor blocks part of your GI system, you may get: A procedure that destroys part of the tumor with a laser on an endoscope, a thin tube that slides down your throat. A thin metal tube called a stent that can keep things flowing. You can get one of these between your stomach and esophagus or between your stomach and small intestine. Gastric bypass surgery to create a route around the tumor. Surgery to remove part of your stomach. Chemo, radiation, or both may be used at this stage, too. You might also get targeted therapy. These drugs attack cancer cells, but leave healthy ones alone, which may mean fewer side effects.', 'How Can I Prevent Stomach Cancer? Treat stomach infections. If you have ulcers from an H. pylori infection, get treatment. Antibiotics can kill the bacteria, and other drugs will heal the sores in the lining of your stomach to cut your risk of cancer. Eat healthy. Get more fresh fruits and vegetables on your plate every day. They’re high in fiber and in some vitamins that can lower your cancer risk. Avoid very salty, pickled, cured, or smoked foods like hot dogs, processed lunch meats, or smoked cheeses. Keep your weight at a healthy level, too. Being overweight or obese can also raise your risk of the disease.', 'Don’t smoke. Your stomach cancer risk doubles if you use tobacco . Limit your alcohol . Recent research suggests that the risk of stomach cancer increases with how often you drink. Watch aspirin or NSAID use. If you take daily aspirin to prevent heart problems or NSAID drugs for arthritis , talk to your doctor about how these drugs might affect your stomach.']"
13,What Is a Peptic Ulcer?,"['You have a peptic ulcer if you get open sores in the lining of your stomach or the upper part of the small intestine. That happens when your stomach acids etch away your digestive tract’s protective layer of mucus . You may have no symptoms, or you may feel discomfort or burning pain. Peptic ulcers can lead to internal bleeding, which sometimes can mean you’ll need blood transfusions in the hospital. You can have two types of peptic ulcer disease: Gastric ulcer . You get this on your stomach lining. Duodenal ulcer. This appears at the top end of the small intestine, an organ that digests and absorbs much of the food you eat. You can have ulcers at any age, but your chances go up as you get older.', 'What Causes Peptic Ulcers? Ulcers form when digestive juices damage the walls of the stomach or small intestine. If the mucus layer gets too thin or your stomach makes too much acid, your gut will feel it. The two major causes are: Bacteria. It’s called Helicobacter pylori ( H. pylori ), and as many as half of us carry it. Most people infected with H. pylori do not get ulcers. But in others, it can raise the amount of acid, break down the protective mucus layer, and irritate the digestive tract. Experts aren’t sure how H. pylori infection spreads. They think it may pass from person to person through close contact, like kissing . You may also get it from unclean food and water. Certain pain relievers. If you’ve been taking aspirin often and for a long time, you’re more likely to get a peptic ulcer . The same is true for other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ). They include ibuprofen and naproxen . NSAIDs block your body from making a chemical that helps protect the inner walls of your stomach and small intestine from stomach acid. Other types of pain meds, such as acetaminophen , won’t lead to peptic ulcers. Smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol also can make you more likely to get ulcers.\xa0 S tress and eating a lot of spicy food don’t cause ulcers, as experts once thought. But they can make ulcers worse and harder to treat.', 'What Are the Symptoms of a Peptic Ulcer? You’ll most likely feel a burning pain or discomfort between your belly button and breastbone. You might especially notice it on an empty stomach -- such as between meals or at night. The pain may stop for a little while if you eat or take an antacid, but then return. The pain can last for a few minutes or a few hours, and may come and go for many days or weeks. Other symptoms may include: Bloated feeling Burping Lack of appetite or weight loss Nausea Bloody or dark poop Vomiting Small ulcers may not cause any symptoms. But if you notice any of these signs, talk to your doctor.', 'How Is a Peptic Ulcer Diagnosed? Your doctor will ask about your symptoms, whether you take NSAIDs and other drugs, and medical history. They’ll also check you for bloating in the belly and pain. That may be enough to make a diagnosis. The only way your doctor can tell for sure if you have an ulcer is to look. They\xa0may use a series of X-rays or a test called an endoscopy . This test allows them\xa0to pass a thin, bendy tube down your throat and into your stomach and small intestine. The tube has a camera at the end so they\xa0can check the lining for ulcers. They\xa0may also take a small piece of the lining to test for H. pylori . Blood , breath, and stool sample tests also can screen for the bacteria.', 'How Is a Peptic Ulcer Treated? Some peptic ulcers heal on their own. But if you don’t treat them, the ulcers tend to come back. They can erode the blood vessel wall in your stomach or small intestine. The ulcers also can eat a hole through the lining and get infected. Or they can cause swelling, which may block food from moving from your stomach into your small intestine. If H. pylori is the culprit, your doctor may prescribe a mix of antibiotics to kill it. If aspirin and other NSAIDs are behind the ulcer, you may need to cut down on them, stop taking them altogether, or switch to another pain reliever. Your doctor may also give you antacids to fight stomach acid, or prescribe medicine to lessen the acid your body makes. Prescription drugs called cytoprotective agents can help protect the lining of the stomach or small intestine so the ulcer can heal.', 'Can You Prevent a Peptic Ulcer? While stress and spicy foods can make symptoms of a peptic ulcer worse, they don’t seem to make you more likely to have one. But a few other things can raise your chances.', ""Be careful when you take pain relievers. Some people who have arthritis or other conditions that cause chronic pain take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) for weeks or months at a time to ease pain and swelling. These medicines can affect the mucus that protects your stomach against acid and make you more likely to have peptic ulcers. These pain relievers include: Aspirin Ibuprofen Naproxen sodium You're more likely to get an ulcer while taking one of these if you: Are over age 65 Are infected with H. pylori bacteria Take more than one NSAID at a time Have had a peptic ulcer in the past Also take a steroid drug or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) To lower your chances for peptic ulcers while you take NSAIDs: Use the lowest possible dose to control your symptoms, and stop taking them as soon as you no longer need them. Take your medicine with food. Don't drink alcohol while you’re taking these medicines."", ""While you're on NSAIDs, you can take medicine to lower the amount of acid your stomach makes. Drugs that can do that include: Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) like esomeprazole ( Nexium ), omeprazole ( Prilosec OTC), and pantoprazole ( Protonix ) H2 blockers such as cimetidine ( Tagamet ), famotidine ( Pepcid ), and nizatidine You can also take the drug misoprostol ( Cytotec ) to boost the amount of protective mucus your stomach makes. But that can cause side effects like diarrhea and stomach cramps. Don’t smoke, and limit alcohol. These two habits make you more likely to get peptic ulcers. Both thin the mucus lining that protects your stomach from acid, leading to more acid. Ask your doctor to recommend a program to help you quit smoking . And talk with them about how much alcohol is safe for you to drink. Manage stress. Stress can make the symptoms of a peptic ulcer worse. Figure out what’s causing issues for you and see how you can deal with it better. For example, getting enough sleep can help with that. It also can boost your immune system ."", ""Consider probiotics. Millions of bacteria normally live in your gut. Some, like H. pylori , cause disease. Others are good for you because they help crowd out harmful bacteria. These helpful bacteria are called probiotics . They’re still being studied, but researchers think they may help with peptic ulcers . You can find them in foods like these: Dairy products that have live cultures, like yogurt, kefir, and aged cheeses Sauerkraut Kimchi Miso Tempeh Prevent H. pylori infection. About two-thirds of people around the world have this type of infection, but most don’t get ulcers because of it. Doctors don’t know how you can avoid H. pylori , but they think it spreads from person to person or through food or water . You can do some things to make an infection less likely: Wash your hands often during the day with warm water and soap so you don't catch or spread H. pylori bacteria. Clean your hands before you eat and after you go to the bathroom. If you don't have soap and water close by, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Cook meat and other foods all the way through. Only drink water that you know is clean.""]"
14,What Is Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome?,"['Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) is a disease of the gastrointestinal system. People who have ZES develop tumors known as gastrinomas in the pancreas and duodenum (the first section of the small intestine). The gastrinomas caused by ZES secrete the hormone gastrin. Because gastrin creates excessive stomach acid, 90 percent of patients with ZES develop stomach and duodenal ulcers.', 'What Are the Complications of Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome? A person who has Zollinger-Ellison syndrome may have only one gastrinoma or may have several. Approximately 25% to 30% of ZES patients also have a genetic (inherited) disorder known as ""multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1,"" which also causes tumors in the pituitary and parathyroid glands. Another complication of ZES is that more than half of single gastrinomas are malignant (cancerous). These malignant gastrinomas can spread to other parts of the body, including the liver , lymph nodes, spleen , bones, or skin .', ""What Are the Symptoms of Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome? People who have Zollinger-Ellison syndrome don't always have symptoms. When symptoms do occur, they include: Abdominal pain Burning pain in the abdomen Nausea Diarrhea Weight loss Vomiting Bleeding from the stomach Weakness Fatigue"", 'How Is Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome Diagnosed? If your doctor suspects that you have ZES, they will perform a blood test to look for high levels of gastrin (the hormone secreted by gastrinomas). They may also perform tests to measure how much acid your stomach is producing. Your doctor may examine you for gastrinomas by performing an endoscopy. This procedure is done with a flexible, lighted tube (an endoscope) that looks at your esophagus , stomach and duodenum. This is often done with endoscopic ultrasound to see the tumor. Other tests your doctor might perform include a CT scan, a special type of X-ray that provides cross-sectional images of the body, a PET scan to locate tumors, and an octreotide scan to look for neuroendocrine tumor cells. Despite these tests, gastrinomas can be difficult to find.', 'How Is Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome Treated? ZES is treated by reducing the amount of acid your stomach produces. Medications called proton pump inhibitors are usually prescribed. These drugs, which include dexlansoprazole ( Dexilant ), esomeprazole ( Nexium ), lansoprazole ( Prevacid ), omeprazole ( Prilosec , Zegerid ), pantoprazole ( Protonix ), and rabeprazole ( Aciphex ), curb the production of stomach acid and allow the ulcers to heal.', 'Treatment of ZES depends on whether the gastrinoma is sporadic or part of the inherited MEN I syndrome. While the latter is usually treated with acid suppression alone, sporadic gastrinomas are treated with acid suppression and surgical removal of the tumor. Somatostatin analogs such as octreotide, which suppresses hormone production, are also very good at controlling symptoms. If there is metastatic disease, you may be offered a combination of therapies including surgery, chemotherapy, or targeted drug therapy or radiation.', ""What Is the Outlook for People with Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome? Gastrinomas tend to grow slowly and are not always malignant. The five-year survival rate depends on whether tumors are cancerous and if they've spread. If they have not spread to the liver , the 5-year survival rate may be 90%. If surgery removes the gastrinoma, 20%-25% of patients are completely cured."", 'Treatment Follow-up for ZES If you have been treated for ZES, you should see your doctor on a regular basis to determine if the gastrinomas recur.']"

Gastritis can be caused by irritation due to excessive alcohol use, chronic vomiting , stress, or the use of certain medications such as aspirin or other anti-inflammatory drugs. It may also be caused by any of the following: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) : A bacteria that lives in the mucous lining of the stomach ; without treatment, the infection can lead to ulcers, and in some people, stomach cancer. Bile reflux: A backflow of bile into the stomach from the bile tract (that connects to the liver and gallbladder ) Infections caused by bacteria and viruses If gastritis is left untreated, it can lead to a severe loss of blood and may increase the risk of developing stomach cancer .', 'What Are the Symptoms of Gastritis? Symptoms of gastritis vary among individuals, and in many people there are no symptoms. However, the most common symptoms include: Nausea or recurrent upset stomach Abdominal bloating Abdominal pain Vomiting Indigestion Burning or gnawing feeling in the stomach between meals or at night Hiccups Loss of appetite Vomiting blood or coffee ground-like material Black, tarry stools', 'How Is Gastritis Diagnosed? To diagnose gastritis, your doctor will review your personal and family medical history, perform a thorough physical evaluation, and may recommend any of the following tests: Upper endoscopy . An endoscope , a thin tube containing a tiny camera, is inserted through your mouth and down into your stomach to look at the stomach lining. The doctor will check for inflammation and may perform a biopsy , a procedure in which a tiny sample of tissue is removed and then sent to a laboratory for analysis. Blood tests. The doctor may perform various blood tests, such as checking your red blood cell count to determine whether you have anemia , which means that you do not have enough red blood cells. They can also screen for H. pylori infection and pernicious anemia with blood tests. Fecal occult blood test (stool test) . This test checks for the presence of blood in your stool, a possible sign of gastritis.', 'What Is the Treatment for Gastritis? Treatment for gastritis usually involves: Taking antacids and other drugs (such as proton pump inhibitors or H-2 blockers) to reduce stomach acid Avoiding hot and spicy foods For gastritis caused by H. pylori infection, your doctor will prescribe a regimen of several antibiotics plus an acid blocking drug (used for heartburn) If the gastritis is caused by pernicious anemia , B12 vitamin shots will be given. Eliminating irritating foods from your diet such as lactose from dairy or gluten from wheat Once the underlying problem disappears, the gastritis usually does, too.

17,"Heartburn: Causes, Symptoms, and Treatment","[""What Is Heartburn? Heartburn is a burning sensation in your chest that happens when stomach acids back up into your esophagus. (Photo Credit: Catherine McQueen/Getty Images) Heartburn is an irritation of your esophagus, the tube that connects your throat and stomach. This leads to a burning discomfort in your upper belly or chest. It's caused by acid reflux, which is when your lower esophageal sphincter (LES) muscle doesn't close properly, letting stomach acids back up into your esophagus. You've probably had heartburn, and it’s usually not serious. If you have it often, you may have something else called gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD. If you don't get it treated, GERD can sometimes cause problems, like: Inflammation and ulcers in the esophagus Hoarseness Some types of lung disease Barrett's esophagus (when your esophagus is damaged by acid reflux)"", 'Heartburn Symptoms Heartburn feels like a burning sensation in the middle of your chest and throat. You may also have: Burning pain in your chest after you eat or at night Pain that worsens when you bend over or lie down A hot, acidic, bitter, or salty taste in the back of your throat A hard time swallowing A feeling of food ""stuck"" in the middle of your chest or throat', 'Heartburn vs. heart attack Heartburn has nothing to do with a heart attack, except they both cause discomfort in your chest that can sometimes be severe. The biggest difference is a heart attack usually feels like tightening and pressure in your chest, while heartburn feels more like burning. Heartburn vs. acid reflux Acid reflux is the issue with your LES muscle that lets stomach acid back up into your esophagus. Heartburn is a symptom of acid reflux. Heartburn vs. indigestion Heartburn and indigestion are not the same. Indigestion is discomfort in your belly, especially after you eat. It also can be a symptom of other digestive problems. How long does heartburn last? For some people, heartburn might last only a few minutes, but for others it can last for several hours. Your symptoms should stop once the last thing you ate finishes digesting. When your stomach is empty, there are no acids to come back up your esophagus.', ""Heartburn Causes Heartburn symptoms can start when the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) valve at the bottom of your esophagus doesn't close correctly. It should stay closed to keep food and stomach acids in your stomach. When you're eating, your LES opens so food can go into your stomach. Then it closes again. If it doesn't close, even just a little, or if it opens when it shouldn't, stomach acids can go back into your esophagus, causing heartburn pain. We don't know what causes the LES valve to weaken, but it could be caused by eating big meals too often, if you're overweight, or you have a hiatal hernia (a hernia in your upper stomach that pushes through your diaphragm). Heartburn risk factors Certain foods can relax your LES or increase stomach acid, including: Tomatoes Citrus fruits Garlic and onions Chocolate Coffee or caffeinated products Alcohol Peppermint Foods high in fats and oils You're also more likely to get heartburn if you: Eat right before bedtime Smoke, vape, or use tobacco products Wear tight-fitting clothing or belts Lie down or bend over after eating Are stressed out Are pregnant Take certain medications, including some antibiotics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Are constipated"", ""Heartburn Diagnosis If your heartburn doesn't improve, it could be a more serious condition known as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Your doctor may be able to diagnose GERD just from your symptoms, but they also might want to do some tests, like: X-ray: You’ll drink a chalky white solution called barium that coats the lining of your upper GI (gastrointestinal) tract, and you'll get an X-ray. This barium lets doctors see defects that could mean problems in your digestive system . Endoscopy: Your doctor will insert a tiny camera on a flexible tube down your throat to give them a view of your upper GI tract. You may be asleep or awake, but you’ll get medicine to make you comfortable. Ambulatory acid probe test (esophageal pH monitoring): An acid monitor is put into your esophagus and connected to a small computer that you can wear on a belt or shoulder strap. It measures when stomach acid backs up into your esophagus and for how long. A newer technique called Bravo measures up to 48-hour acid; it is done using wireless pH sensors, so you won't need for a tube to be put into your esophagus. Esophageal motility testing (esophageal manometry): This test uses a catheter to measure the pressure and movement of your esophagus when you swallow."", ""Heartburn Treatment Usually, you can treat heartburn with over-the-counter medicines, including: Antacids counteract the acid in your stomach to ease heartburn pain. They can also sometimes help with stomach pains, indigestion, and gas. Chewing them up really well before you swallow them might give you faster relief. If you use them too often, they can cause side effects, including constipation, diarrhea, a change in the color of your bowel movements, and stomach cramps. Acid (H2) blockers like cimetidine (Tagamet) and famotidine (Pepcid) reduce the amount of acid in your stomach. They don't work as fast as antacids, but the effects can last longer. Proton pump inhibitors work to reduce stomach acid, too, and include esomeprazole (Nexium), lansoprazole (Prevacid), and omeprazole (Prilosec OTC). If OTC medicines don’t work for you, your doctor may be able to give you a stronger prescription version. It's rare, but surgery is sometimes needed to fix symptoms of heartburn. You may need an operation if: Other treatments haven’t helped. Your LES muscle doesn’t work properly. Your heartburn is caused by GERD. You have cancer in your esophagus. (Keep in mind that trouble swallowing, and not heartburn or GERD, is the most common symptom of this type of cancer.)"", ""Heartburn Complications Tell your doctor right away if you have confusion, chest tightness, bleeding, a sore throat, fever, irregular heartbeat, weakness, or unusual fatigue. Get medical help right away if you have any chest pain, pressure, or burning that doesn’t go away (even with medications and lifestyle changes). These can also be signs of a heart attack. Also get medical help if you're vomiting blood or what looks like dark coffee grounds. See a doctor right away if your stools are black, bloody, or a maroon color. If your heartburn is severe and over-the-counter medicines don’t help, or if you've taken them for more than 2 weeks, call your doctor. Also see your doctor if you're losing weight without trying or having trouble swallowing. Your doctor can check to see what is causing the problem and what the best solution will be for you. Occasional heartburn isn't dangerous. But GERD can sometimes lead to serious problems, such as: A long-term cough Laryngitis Inflammation or ulcers of the esophagus Problems swallowing because of a narrow esophagus Barrett's esophagus, a condition that can make it more likely to get esophageal cancer"", ""Heartburn Prevention There are things you can do to prevent heartburn, including changing what and when you eat. Other changes you can make that might help prevent heartburn include: Keep a healthy weight, and lose weight if you need to. Avoid foods and beverages that make your symptoms worse. Eat smaller meals throughout the day, and don't eat late at night. Eat slowly. Don't smoke, vape, or use tobacco. Wait 3 hours after you eat before you lie down. Elevate the head of your bed 6 to 8 inches."", ""Takeaways You get heartburn when acids in your stomach back up into your esophagus, the tube that goes between your mouth and stomach. The acid causes a painful, burning sensation in your chest. You usually get heartburn after you eat or when you're lying down, and the symptoms last for several hours. It's not life-threatening and is usually treated with lifestyle changes or over-the-counter medicines."", 'Heartburn FAQs Does yogurt help with heartburn? Low-fat yogurt is similar to milk in how it can soothe heartburn. Plus yogurt has probiotics (good bacteria) that also help with digestion. So eating a serving of low-fat yogurt may help relieve symptoms of heartburn', 'Is heartburn genetic? Heartburn is often a symptom of gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD. Many studies have shown a link between genes and GERD, including several twins studies and a family study. All showed that genetics played a role, but we still need more research to know for sure how genes are involved.']"
18,What Is a Soft Tissue Sarcoma?,"['Soft tissue sarcomas are a group of cancers that grow in parts of your body such as your muscles, bones, deep layers of skin , or in fat. They also can form on blood vessels, nerves, or connective tissues, which support organs and other kinds of tissues. Soft tissue sarcomas are rare. They account for less than 1% of all cases of cancer . But there are dozens of different types, and they can happen in children and adults. About 13,000 people are diagnosed with one of these cancers every year.', 'Causes Doctors aren’t sure why these types of cancers happen, but some things may raise your chances of having one: A family history of certain diseases that you can inherit from your parents. These include neurofibromatosis and Gardner syndrome , which are disorders that make tumors grow in parts of your body. Certain chemicals like arsenic, vinyl chloride, or dioxin. Radiation , including during treatment for other kinds of cancer.', 'Symptoms The most common sign of a soft tissue sarcoma is a painless lump or growth. But some may not be noticeable until they’re big enough to press on nearby muscles or nerves.', 'About 1 in 5 soft tissue sarcomas happen in the belly. You probably wouldn’t learn that you have one until they caused other problems, such as stomach pain , bleeding, or a blocked intestine. A doctor might find a sarcoma in your lungs or chest only after you have chest pain or trouble breathing . About 10% of the time, a sarcoma will start on your head or neck. The most common type of soft tissue sarcoma in children, called rhabdomyosarcoma , happens mostly in those areas. You should see your doctor if: You notice a growing lump somewhere on your body. You have stomach pain that’s getting worse. Your stool appears black or bloody. You’re vomiting blood. Most visible lumps aren’t sarcoma. They’re usually a harmless cluster of fat cells called a lipoma. But if you have one that’s bigger than 2 inches and growing or causing pain , see your doctor.', 'Diagnosis If your doctor thinks you may have a sarcoma, you’ll probably get:', 'A physical examination . Your doctor will look closely at any lumps or bumps. Imaging tests. These might include: X-rays An ultrasound . This uses sound waves to show an image of the inside of your body on a monitor. It’s usually used to look inside your belly. An MRI scan. This uses powerful magnets and radio waves to make detailed images of the inside of your body. It’s typically used for your arms or legs. A biopsy . Your doctor will take a sample of the growth to look at under a microscope. Most of the time, this can done with a needle, but in some cases, you might need minor surgery. If the tests show that you have cancer , your doctor will use the results to find out the stage of the cancer. That’s a number I through IV that’s based on how big it is and whether it’s in other parts of your body.', 'Questions for Your Doctor You may want to ask: How do you know it’s cancer? Could it be something else? What kind of soft tissue sarcoma do I have? How far has it spread? What kind of treatment should I get, and why? How well does that treatment work? What kind of side effects will I have if I get that treatment? Are there other ways to treat this kind of cancer? Who will be in charge of my treatment? How often have they treated this kind of cancer? What do I need to do to prepare for my treatment? If I have another health condition, how will it be affected? What support is available to help me and my family? Where can I learn more about my type of cancer?', 'Treatment This will depend on where the cancer is and how far it’s spread, but surgery is usually the first step. Your doctors will try to take out any tumors without harming the healthy tissue around them.', 'They might take out one or more of your lymph nodes to check if your sarcoma has reached them and spread to other places in your body. If a tumor is in one of your arms or legs, your doctors may try to replace any tissue they have to take out. They might use tissue from another part of your body or artificial implants. In rare cases, your doctors may have to remove a limb. For some people, surgery may be all it takes to get rid of the cancer. But if a sarcoma has spread to other parts of your body, your doctor also may recommend chemotherapy , which uses strong drugs to attack cancer cells as they grow. You might get these medicines through an IV, or you might take them as pills. If the tumor is too hard to take out completely or you’re too ill to have an operation, doctors might skip surgery and go straight to radiation therapy. This uses high-energy particles or X-rays to kill cancer cells. Your doctor will use what’s known as external beam therapy, where a machine aims that radiation at part of your body. You may get it daily for several weeks. Some institutions do intraoperative radiation therapy, which you get during surgery after the tumor is removed but before the surgeon stitches you back up.', 'In other cases, a method called brachytherapy may be an option. Doctors put small radioactive pellets in the part of your body where the tumor is and then take them out a few days later. You may have to stay in the hospital while the pellets are inside. Your doctors also might suggest radiation therapy to shrink a tumor before they try surgery to take it out. Or they might recommend it after the surgery so they can kill any remaining cancer cells. Chemotherapy and radiation can damage normal cells along with the cancerous ones, and that can cause some side effects. Chemotherapy and radiation can cause nausea , vomiting, and fatigue . Chemotherapy also can make your hair fall out and lead to a loss of appetite and sores in your mouth.', 'Radiation also can cause redness, peeling, or blistering on your skin where the beams were aimed. If radiation targets your belly or pelvis, it may cause diarrhea . If it’s aimed at your head or chest, it may hurt to swallow.', 'As with any type of cancer, it could come back. Doctors call that “recurrent” soft tissue sarcoma. Your treatment for a recurrence would depend on whether it comes back in the same place or if it shows up in other parts of your body. Just like with the first time, the options might include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or brachytherapy. You can ask your doctor if there is a clinical trial for your type of sarcoma. These test new ways of treating cancer.', 'What to Expect It takes a team to counter cancer. Before your treatment starts, you’ll meet with doctors, nurses, and technicians who will manage your therapy. They’ll lay out the plan they recommend and tell you about any side effects you might have. After that, you’ll be asked to sign forms saying that your doctors have told you about the procedures and that you’ve agreed to them. Your doctors will tell you if you need to stop certain foods or activities during your treatment. Be sure to tell them about any medications (even those that you can buy “over the counter,” or without a prescription) and supplements (including vitamins and “natural” products) you take regularly. Your therapy may keep you out of work for a while. Talk with your supervisor about your condition and whether you might need to change your schedule or duties while you get treatment. It’s against the law for your employer to treat you unfairly because of your illness.', 'Taking Care of Yourself Finding out that you have soft tissue sarcoma may change some things about your life. Surgery and other types of treatment might change how you feel about yourself and your body. Some also can affect your sex life and your ability to have children. Having cancer can take a toll on you mentally and emotionally, as well as physically. Each person is different, but a lot of people deal with feelings of fear, anger, uncertainty, and stress . These feelings can take a toll on your loved ones as well. If those feelings are hard to handle, talk with your doctors, a counselor, clergy member, or friends. During treatment, try to eat a healthy diet and get as much rest as you can. You may feel weak, so ask your doctors about exercises that may help you keep up your energy.', 'Getting Support Many people know what it’s like to face cancer, and there are a lot of support groups to help you deal with the issues it causes.', 'These groups can help you talk about feelings and concerns you may not want to share with family or friends. They may also be a way to learn more about what to expect and how your life may change. Some groups are led by professionals who guide the discussions, while others are led by people who are going through the same things you are. There also are groups for family members or caregivers. Your doctors, nurses, or a counselor can help you find groups that might help.']"

You might hear your doctor call it delayed gastric emptying.', ""Gastroparesis Symptoms With gastroparesis, you may have: Heartburn or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) Acid reflux Upset stomach Throwing up undigested food Nausea Vomiting A feeling of fullness quickly when you eat Not getting enough nutrition Bloating Lack of appetite and weight loss Trouble controlling blood sugar Belly pain Some people who have gastroparesis don't have any symptoms they can notice. What is gastroparesis pain like? If you have pain with gastroparesis, it's often in the upper belly area, around the stomach or intestines. It can be dull or sharp pain."", ""Gastroparesis Causes For most people, doctors can't figure out what brings on gastroparesis. They do know that it often affects women more than men. Gastroparesis from diabetes Diabetes is the most common known cause of gastroparesis. It can damage nerves—including the vagus nerve, which regulates your digestive system —and certain cells in your stomach."", ""Gastroparesis risk factors Some things can make you more prone to getting gastroparesis, including: Injury to your vagus nerve from surgery A lack of thyroid hormone (hypothyroidism) Viral stomach infections (gastroenteritis) Medications such as narcotics and some antidepressants Parkinson's disease Multiple sclerosis Rare conditions such as amyloidosis (deposits of protein fibers in tissues and organs) and scleroderma (a connective tissue disorder that affects your skin, blood vessels, skeletal muscles, and internal organs)"", ""Gastroparesis Complications Gastroparesis can result in some problems, including: Bacteria growth, if food stays in your stomach for too long and ferments Serious dehydration, if you can't keep fluids down A blockage of your small intestine, when food hardens into a solid lump called a bezoar and stops food from passing from your stomach Malnutrition, if your body can't get the nutrients it needs Rising blood sugar levels , when food finally leaves your stomach and enters your small intestine. Gastroparesis makes it harder to control your blood sugar Gastroparesis can also affect your overall quality of life. The symptoms you have can make everyday life harder, and it can take longer for you to do things."", ""Gastroparesis Diagnosis Your doctor will ask about your symptoms and medical history. They'll also do a physical exam. They may order tests including: Radioisotope gastric-emptying scan (gastric scintigraphy). Your doctor will give you food that contains a very small amount of something radioactive. Then, you lie under a scanning machine. If more than 10% of food is still in your stomach 4 hours after eating, you have gastroparesis. Blood tests. These can spot dehydration , malnutrition, infection, or blood sugar problems. Barium X-ray. You'll drink a liquid (barium), which coats your esophagus, stomach, and small intestine and shows up on an X-ray. This is also known as an upper gastrointestinal series or a barium swallow. Gastric emptying breath tests (13C-GEBTs). This is a nonradioactive test that measures how fast your stomach empties after you eat a meal that has a chemical element called the 13C isotope added to it. Gastric manometry. Your doctor passes a thin tube through your mouth and into your stomach to check electrical and muscular activity and to figure out how fast you're digesting. Electrogastrography. This measures electrical activity in your stomach using electrodes on your skin. The smart pill. You swallow a tiny electronic device that sends information about how fast it's traveling as it moves through your digestive system. Ultrasound . This imaging test uses sound waves to create pictures of your organs. Your doctor may use it to rule out other diseases. Upper endoscopy. Your doctor passes a thin tube called an endoscope down your esophagus to look at the lining of your stomach."", ""Gastroparesis Treatment Depending on the cause, gastroparesis can be chronic, which means it lasts a long time. You can take steps to manage and control it. Changes in diet for gastroparesis Changing your eating habits is one of the best ways to control gastroparesis symptoms. You might try eating six small meals each day rather than three larger ones. This way, you have less food in your stomach and don't feel as full. Have more liquids and low-residue foods, such as applesauce instead of whole apples . Drink plenty of water and fluids like low-fat broths, soups, juices, and sports drinks. Avoid high-fat foods, which can slow digestion, and high-fiber foods, which are harder to digest."", ""Make sure you're getting enough of the right nutrition. Your doctor might send you to a dietitian who can help you find foods you like that are easy to digest. Don't lie down for 2 hours after you eat. Gravity can help your digestion and keep food or acid from traveling into your throat. Gentle exercise like walking can help you feel better."", ""Get some other ideas for eating with gastroparesis. Gastroparesis medication Your doctor might give you medicines including: Drugs to stimulate your stomach muscles. You take metoclopramide (Reglan) before eating. It causes your stomach muscles to contract and move food along. It also helps with upset stomach and vomiting. Side effects include diarrhea, drowsiness, anxiety , and, rarely, a serious neurological disorder. Erythromycin is an antibiotic that also causes stomach contractions and helps move food out. Side effects include diarrhea and the growth of resistant bacteria if you take it for a long time. Antiemetics. These drugs— including diphenhydramine (Benadryl and others) and ondansetron (Zofran)— help control nausea. If the nausea and vomiting won't go away, prochlorperazine (Compro) may work. Other treatments for gastroparesis If you have diabetes, controlling your blood sugar levels will keep you from having serious problems. Your doctor might need to give you a feeding tube or jejunostomy tube. They put it in through your belly and into your small intestine. To feed yourself, you'll put nutrients into the tube, and they'll go directly into your small intestine. This way, they skip your stomach and get into your bloodstream faster."", ""Your doctor can also inject botulinum toxin (such as Botox) into your pylorus, the valve from your stomach to your small intestine . This relaxes the valve, keeping it open for longer so your stomach can empty. Electrical stimulation uses electrodes attached to your stomach wall to trigger stomach contractions. In a procedure called per-oral pyloromyotomy, your doctor uses an endoscope to cut your pylorus valve so it's easier for your stomach to empty. Although surgery can sometimes cause gastroparesis, patients who have obesity and diabetes might have gastric bypass surgery. Your doctor creates a small pouch from the top part of your stomach and attaches it to the lower end of your small intestine. This limits how much food you can eat. If your case is severe, you might also need intravenous nutrition or parenteral nutrition, in which nutrients go straight into your bloodstream through a catheter in a vein in your chest. Doctors tend to use this for only a short time."", ""Takeaways Doctors don't always know what causes gastroparesis, but diabetes is one common cause. If you have symptoms including nausea, throwing up undigested food, heartburn, and belly pain, let your doctor know so they can do tests to see whether you have gastroparesis. This condition is treated with drugs that stimulate your stomach muscles so food can more easily go through to your intestines. Your doctor may also suggest you take a medicine to calm your nausea and stop you from vomiting . Making some changes to the way you eat might help your gastroparesis. Drink plenty of fluids and have several smaller meals instead of two or three bigger ones. Make sure your food is nutritious."", ""Gastroparesis FAQ How common is gastroparesis? It's not a common disorder. Of 100,000 people, about 10 men and 40 women have gastroparesis. But the symptoms are very much like other kinds of gastrointestinal conditions (ones that affect your stomach and intestines). About one out of every four people in the U.S. have symptoms similar to gastroparesis.""]"
20,What Is Gastroschisis?,"['Gastroschisis is a rare condition. It’s when your baby is born with a hole near their belly button, and their intestines , and sometimes other organs like the stomach and liver , end up on the outside of their\xa0body. It starts as your baby grows inside your womb. If the muscles in your baby ’s belly don’t form correctly, it leaves an opening and their\xa0internal organs push through it. Babies with gastroschisis will need an operation soon after they are born and may need to stay in the hospital for some time. While this condition can be especially scary for parents, babies often do fine once the condition is fixed.', 'Who Gets It and Why? Gastroschisis occurs in about one out of every 5,000 births. It’s most common in the babies of young moms in their late teens or early 20s. White teenagers have higher rates than African-American teenagers. And it happens more often in moms who smoke or drink alcohol . There are multiple potential causes. It’s not always one thing, and some cases have no clear cause. Some think it’s due to changes in the baby ’s genes or chromosomes, or a problem with blood flow to the digestive tract. Others say it could be medicines the mom takes, or exposure to things in the environment. Some doctors believe it could be caused by what the mom eats or drinks. But others say that has nothing to do with it.', 'Testing Around the 16 th week of your pregnancy , the doctor can do a test to look for a certain protein in your blood . If the level is high, the doctor will do an ultrasound test. Ultrasound is a painless way to look inside your womb. It can help determine if your baby has gastroschisis. If so, you should see a doctor who is an expert in high-risk pregnancy.', 'How Does It Affect the Mom? If your baby has gastroschisis, you’ll need extra attention while you are pregnant. Ultrasound and other tests will help the doctor know how the baby is growing and developing. That’s important because babies with gastroschisis tend to be smaller than others. As your pregnancy goes on, you will have tests more often.', 'The doctor will probably ask you to keep track of how often the baby moves inside of you. That’s called fetal movement counting. It’s a way to know if your baby is well and moves as it should. The doctor will explain how to count the movements and what to look for. Your doctor will probably induce (bring on) labor at 35 to 37 weeks. That’s a bit earlier than the normal 40 weeks. They’ve learned that it’s safer to have the baby early. Gastroschisis doesn’t necessarily mean you need a C-section (an operation in which the baby is removed through an incision in the lower abdomen). But you should plan to deliver at a hospital with an intensive care nursery. That’s because the baby will need surgery soon after birth.', 'How Does It Affect the Baby? With gastroschisis, the organs that grow outside the baby aren’t protected like they would be if they were inside. They are exposed to amniotic fluid , the liquid that surrounds the baby in the womb. That can cause damage to the organs. Once the baby is born, the intestines may be twisted. Or the bowel may not be in the right position. The baby could have trouble with digestion and feeding. If the organs were not damaged too badly before birth, the baby has a good chance to grow normally once the organs are back inside.', 'Surgery There are two ways to fix the problem. Primary gastroschisis repair is done if the condition isn’t too severe. Right after the baby is born, the surgeon will put the organs back inside the baby’s belly. The surgeon will then repair the opening. Staged gastroschisis repair is for more serious cases. After the baby is born, the organs that stick out are carefully covered to protect them. Over several days, they are slowly pushed back inside. After everything is back in, the surgeon operates to fix the hole in the belly. The baby may need help to breathe after the surgery because of added pressure from the organs that are now back inside their body. The doctors will want to keep the baby’s stomach empty, so they\xa0will be fed intravenously (through an IV), not through the mouth . This is also a way to safely give medicine.', 'The organs that have been put back may be thick and swollen. Your baby will probably have to stay in the hospital for weeks, sometimes longer, until everything heals and begins to work correctly. Everyone hopes for a healthy child. But with good care for you and for your baby, both before and after birth, you can expect a good outcome in spite of this birth defect .']"
21,Gaucher Disease,"[""What Is Gaucher Disease? Gaucher disease is a rare condition passed down through your family.

Some people don't have any at all. There are many treatments for type 1. Type 2 and type 3 are more serious. Both affect the central nervous system. Babies with type 2 usually don't live past age 2. Type 3 also causes damage to the brain and spinal cord, but symptoms show up later in childhood. Your blood might not clot well, or you might get anemia . It can also cause bone mineral loss that leads to pain and easily broken bones."", ""It's passed along in families -- about 1 in 450 people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent (from Eastern and Central Europe) have the condition.

If I have more children, what are the chances they'll have Gaucher\xa0disease?"", 'Gaucher Disease Treatment How your doctor treats Gaucher\xa0disease depends on several things. Some treatments can only be used by adults. Others are designed for a specific type of Gaucher. If your symptoms are mild, you may not need any treatment.', ""Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is one choice for people who have type 1 and some with type 3. It helps ease anemia , build bone strength to ease pain and avoid breaks, and shrinks an enlarged spleen or liver. ERT doesn't work as well if you have type 3 disease that gives you brain or nervous system problems like seizures. That's because the drug can't get from your blood into your brain."", ""Enzyme replacement therapy medications include: Imiglucerase ( Cerezyme ) Taliglucerase alfa ( Elelyso ) Velaglucerase alfa ( VPRIV ) These are IV drugs.

This procedure is complicated and can cause both short-term and long-term problems, so it's rarely used. Pain treatments. Kids and adults with Gaucher may take drugs like acetaminophen or ibuprofen for mild pain or opioids for stronger pain.

Treatment can help you feel better and might help you live longer. You might consider joining a clinical trial . Scientists use them to study new methods to treat Gaucher\xa0disease. These trials test new drugs to see if they're safe and if they work. They often are a way for people to try new medicine that isn't available to everyone. Your doctor can tell you if one of these trials might be a good fit."", ""If your child has Gaucher, they might not grow as quickly as other kids. They might be late in reaching puberty. Depending on your symptoms, they may need to avoid contact sports or limit your movement. Some people have very bad pain and fatigue. It may take extra effort to be active. Little things can make a big difference, though. For example, wheelchairs or crutches can help when you're having trouble walking. Naps are also useful. If you have serious symptoms, you may need help every day and might not be able to live alone. Whether you have the disease or are caring for someone who has it, this is a tough condition to manage.

22,Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome,"['What Is Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome? Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (WKS) is one name for two conditions that often happen together -- Wernicke encephalopathy and Korsakoff syndrome. Many doctors think of them as different stages of the same disease. They can happen if you don’t get enough vitamin B1, also called thiamine. Vitamin B1 helps your brain turn sugar into energy. When your brain and nervous system don’t get the amount they need, they don’t work as well. Wernicke encephalopathy typically comes on suddenly, and you’ll need treatment right away. Symptoms include confusion, loss of muscle coordination, and trouble with your vision . Korsakoff syndrome happens more slowly. It’s a long-term, ongoing problem that damages the part of your brain that handles memory.', 'Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome Symptoms The main signs of Wernicke encephalopathy are: Balance and movement issues. You might have leg tremors, and your walk might become slow and unsteady, with a wide stance and short steps. You may need help standing and getting around, and your arms and legs might feel weak. Confusion. You may feel out of it and lose interest in what’s happening around you. Eye problems . You may have double vision , your eyelids might droop, or your eyes may move around quickly.', 'You also may have problems with your heart and blood vessels that can lead to: Drowsiness Fainting A faster heartbeat than normal Low blood pressure when you stand up A lack of energy If you aren’t treated for Wernicke encephalopathy quickly, it can lead to Korsakoff syndrome. Symptoms of Korsakoff syndrome usually begin as the signs of Wernicke encephalopathy start to go away. The telltale sign is the loss of short-term memory. That also makes it hard for you to learn anything new or make new memories. You might talk to someone and seem like yourself. But a minute or two later, you won’t remember anything about it, not even who you spoke with. You may also have: Some long-term memory loss The urge to make up stories without knowing it to fill in any gaps Hallucinations A hard time putting words into context Trouble understanding or processing information', 'Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome Causes and Risk Factors In many cases, the lack of vitamin B1 is caused by heavy, long-term alcohol use. Over time, alcohol affects how well your body absorbs, stores, and uses it.', ""It also can happen if you don’t get enough nutrients from your diet or if you have certain health problems. These other causes include: Some diseases that affect your whole body, like cancer , AIDS , or serious infections Eating disorders , like anorexia Serious kidney problems Chemotherapy treatment for cancer Some stomach conditions Throwing up often and over a long period of time Weight loss surgery , also known as gastric bypass Men get Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome a little more often than women, and it typically happens in people ages 45-65. It's also more common in: People who are homeless Older adults living alone People with serious mental health conditions These groups are more likely to abuse alcohol or not eat well."", 'Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome Diagnosis Typically, it’s based on a physical exam , your health history, and some tests. Your doctor will also want to rule out other problems that could cause your symptoms. You may get: Blood tests to see how much thiamine is in your system and how well your liver and kidneys are working Imaging scans of your brain to rule out problems like a tumor or stroke An eye exam to check your eye movement A mental health exam Tests to check your brain and nervous system Tests to look at changes in how you walk', 'Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome Treatment The first step is to get plenty of vitamin B1. You’ll probably have it put directly into a vein through a needle in your hand or arm (an IV). You might need to have this every day for several months. From there, it’s important to stay away from alcohol and eat a balanced diet . That’ll help keep symptoms from coming back. If it affects how you walk, you’ll likely need physical therapy .', 'Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome Complications Korsakoff syndrome typically can’t be reversed. In serious cases, it can cause brain damage and lead to problems with memory and your walk that don’t go away.', 'Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome Outlook Your recovery will depend mostly on how early you started treatment. If you catch and treat it early, you can make a full recovery, but it could take up to a year. Confusion and issues related to it are often the last symptoms to go away.']"
23,What Is a Growth Hormone Stimulation Test?,"['Our bodies usually change quietly, almost without notice. Children grow taller. Our hair often thins as we age. It’s all part of maturing, and it’s controlled by hormones. But sometimes things go wrong. The hormone that helps control growth and the chemical reactions in our bodies is called human growth hormone. (You may see it written as HGH, or GH for short.) Your body might make it in great amounts or not at all. Too much or too little HGH can lead to a variety of issues, including: Dwarfism Fatigue Bone weakness Delayed puberty If you or your child has any of these conditions, your doctor may suggest you take a growth hormone stimulation test. The basis of this test is a simple blood sample, which is then looked at in a lab. Though growth hormone issues can cause problems if left untreated, treating them may be as simple as a regular injection of growth hormone. And in children, these issues may get better on their own over time.', 'Your Pituitary Gland Growth hormone is made by the pituitary gland. It’s a pea-sized gland near the center of your head, just below the front of the brain and behind your nose. GH isn’t the only hormone made by the pituitary gland. In fact, the pituitary has been called the “master gland” because its hormones help control other hormones. It’s part of what’s called the endocrine system, which oversees many body functions. But if too much or too little GH is in your body, there may be something wrong with your pituitary gland. In children, you may find this out during a visit with your pediatrician. During a typical visit, your pediatrician will likely check your child for height, weight , and head size and see how they compare with the normal range for children of that age. If the measurements are outside that range, they may order tests. If you’re an adult, you may want to visit your doctor if your symptoms include: Low energy Less strength Depression Decline in muscle mass Increase in body fat', 'There are many different possible causes for these symptoms, but they may also signal issues with GH production. A test can measure the amount of GH in your blood . Your pituitary gland releases GH in pulses that vary by sex, age, and even time of day. That is why doctors use different methods to stimulate or suppress the release of growth hormone before you take the test.', ""How to Prepare Your Child for the Test Several tests may be needed to see if your child has a growth hormone deficiency. Some involve the measurement of different hormones with simple blood tests. The growth hormone stimulation uses one or two different medications to “stimulate” or raise the amount of GH released by their body. Then your doctor can see how much the child's body is making. There are a number of things that may be required and helpful before your child takes the test: Fast: Your child shouldn’t have any food after midnight the day of the test."", ""Avoid medications: They shouldn't take certain medications the night before and the day of the test unless your doctor or nurse has permitted them. One of the medicines that may be used, such as clonidine , doesn’t mix with medications such as amphetamine and dextroamphetamine ( Adderall ) or methylphenidate ( Ritalin ), so your doctor will give you instructions on whether you need to make any changes with them before the test. Be ready to pass the time: Since the test takes a few hours, bring books, videos, or other distractions to keep your child from getting bored. Be sure they wear comfortable clothes."", 'How Adults Can Prepare Your doctor will typically ask you to take more than one kind of test. You may need the stimulation test, as well as some of these other tests: The IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 tests, which check the amount of a different but related hormones Tests to check for issues with other hormones, including cortisol , prolactin , and testosterone', 'Children will also typically get a combination of these tests. If you need to take a growth hormone stimulation test, you may need to: Fast: Some medical experts recommend up to 12 hours without food before the test. Talk to your doctor about this beforehand to find out what you should do in your case. Avoid certain medications: These include insulin , birth control pills , and the herb St. John’s wort. If you take these or any other medicines, talk to your doctor to see what you need to do. Don’t exercise : Workouts 10 hours or less before the test can throw off resting hormone levels. Testing takes up to 3 hours, so you should also dress comfortably and bring a book or some entertainment. Low blood sugar and obesity may skew results, so talk with your doctor if you have these conditions.', 'What Happens During the Test? For your child, the test begins with a technician placing an IV line in their arm or hand .', 'After giving a blood sample, your child will get a dose of medicine or medicines to stimulate the pituitary gland to release growth hormone. The most common medicines chosen are clonidine ( Catapres ), arginine or glucagon . Insulin is less commonly used now because of safety concerns with children. During all of this, the assistant will probably take a blood sample around every 30 minutes. The samples are not large -- perhaps a couple of teaspoons, total, over the course of the day. At the end of the test, your child can eat. They should rest afterwards. It’s a similar process for adults who get the GH stimulation test. Adults have the option of a medicine called macimorelin ( Macrilen )which is given as a liquid to drink. Insulin is less often used now because of unpleasant side effects and safety concerns due to low blood sugars. Both children and adult blood samples can also be checked for IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 alongside the stimulation test.', 'If you take the GH suppression test, you’ll drink a glucose solution in the first 5 minutes, and get your blood checked every 30 minutes for 2 hours. Growth hormone tests aren’t likely to cause any complications, though some people may feel faint . Bruising is possible where the IV line went into your vein.', 'What the Results Mean Test results should be ready in several days. High levels of GH may suggest: Possible acromegaly Gigantism (in children, it can cause really long bones, delayed puberty , and other problems) A tumor Low levels may indicate: Possible dwarfism Slow growth Hypopituitarism, which means your pituitary gland isn’t working as well as it should. Because GH issues may be related to other glands, such as the thyroid , your doctor may recommend that you get more tests. If your doctor suspects a tumor, they may ask you to get an MRI , CT scan , or X-ray.']"
24,What Is Gianotti-Crosti Syndrome?,"[""Gianotti-Crosti syndrome is a rash that usually affects young children. It's sometimes called papular acrodermatitis of childhood. The rash covers the arms, legs, and face. It can cause itching and discomfort. Gianotti-Crosti is usually a delayed immune reaction to a virus. The rash will appear as your child is recovering from an illness such as a respiratory infection or stomach virus. It's very common and doesn't have lasting effects, but it can be alarming when it appears on your child's skin."", ""What Is the Cause of Gianotti-Crosti Syndrome? Gianotti-Crosti syndrome is a childhood skin condition that caused an itchy, blistering rash. It typically begins on the buttocks and spreads, often to the face and extremities. It's sometimes referred to as papular acrodermatitis of childhood. GCS usually appears while your child is recovering from a viral infection like a respiratory illness or stomach virus. While the blisters can be alarming and the child can have fever and discomfort, there are no lasting effects. Viral illnesses trigger Gianotti-Crosti syndrome. The rash will typically begin as your child is recovering from another illness. Some children also get it after receiving live-virus vaccinations, such as the shots for poliovirus, hepatitis A, diphtheria, smallpox, pertussis, and influenza. It's most common in children under the age of 9 years old, and children with underlying skin conditions like atopic dermatitis are also more likely to develop Gianotti-Crosti. Adults can get it, too, with women being more susceptible to it than men. The condition is most prevalent in spring and summer."", ""Doctors aren't sure why some viruses lead to a Gianotti-Crosti response. There is a broad assumption that it's part of the immune response to viruses, but experts don't know exactly why some people get it while others don't\u200c. The most common triggers for Gianotti-Crosti in the United States include: Coxsackievirus (hand, foot, and mouth disease) Epstein-Barr virus (infectious mononucleosis) Cytomegalovirus (CVM) Enterovirus infections (often seen as respiratory infections) ECHO viruses (often seen as gastrointestinal illness or viral meningitis ) Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) In regions other than the United States, hepatitis B is a common trigger for Gianotti-Crosti syndrome. In the United States, children are usually vaccinated against hepatitis B. If your child has not been vaccinated for hepatitis B, you may need to have them tested if symptoms manifest."", ""What Are the Symptoms of Gianotti-Crosti Syndrome? A Gianotti-Costi rash looks like an outbreak of raised blisters that appear on your child's skin. The rash often first appears on or near the buttocks, then spreads to the arms, legs, and face. The blisters vary in size and may be filled with fluid. They may be pink, red, or brown in color."", ""The blisters may become itchy or uncomfortable. Your child may also have swollen lymph nodes and a mild fever along with the rash. Children may also experience swelling of the liver or spleen, but you would need a doctor to confirm those symptoms. The rash usually lasts about four weeks, though it can linger as long as eight weeks. It will go away on its own. The rash doesn't typically cause scarring on the skin. There may be dark spots that remain on the skin, but they generally fade after six months. Any other symptoms will also clear up over time."", ""How Is Gianotti-Crosti Syndrome Diagnosed? Tests are not needed to diagnose Gianotti-Crosti syndrome. Your child's doctor will do a physical exam and ask questions about how long the rash has been present. Your doctor will also ask about any illnesses your child may have had in the weeks before the rash appeared. They might check their vaccination records to see if a recent inoculation could be the cause of the rash. If there is cause to worry about a serious viral infection such as hepatitis or HIV, they may test for that."", ""What Is the Treatment for Gianotti-Crosti Syndrome? The main symptom -- the rash -- will go away on its own. But if it’s itchy, you can use over-the-counter anti-itch treatments to ease the symptoms. Your doctor may suggest oral antihistamines if topical treatments don't help. Cool compresses may also reduce itching. If your child has a fever, ask your doctor about using a fever reducer such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Ask about appropriate dosing for your child's age. Make sure your child drinks plenty of fluids, since fevers can be dehydrating. Gianotti-Crosti syndrome is not contagious, so you don't need to isolate your child while they have the rash. In fact, the rash usually appears after the child has stopped being contagious with the virus that triggered the syndrome. Your child can participate in activities while the rash is still present, though you may need a note from your doctor to explain the situation.""]"
25,Giant Cell Arteritis (Temporal Arteritis),"['Giant cell arteritis, also called temporal arteritis, is a disease that causes your arteries -- blood vessels that carry oxygen from your heart to the rest of your body -- to become inflamed. It usually happens to the large and medium-sized temporal arteries that run along both sides of your head. The cells of these inflamed arteries look giant under a microscope, which is how the condition got its name. The swelling slows blood flow through your arteries, and that can cause symptoms like headaches and pain in your face and joints. Left untreated, narrowed arteries can cause vision problems and blindness. Medication can help your symptoms and prevent serious health issues.', ""Causes It’s an autoimmune disease. That means your immune system mistakenly attacks your body's healthy tissues. In giant cell arteritis, immune cells react against blood vessels and make them inflamed. Doctors don't know what triggers this, but you're more likely to get it if you're: Over 50 Female Of European descent -- especially if your family is from a country in Scandinavia (Norway, Sweden, Denmark, or Finland)"", 'Symptoms One of the main symptoms\xa0is a headache you feel in your temples and scalp. The pain can be severe. Other symptoms may include: Fever Fatigue Pain in your jaw when you chew Pain in your face Vision problems such as blurred vision, double vision, or sudden vision loss Pain in your shoulders, arms, neck, and hip Appetite loss Weight loss Cough Sore throat Tongue pain If you notice these symptoms, let your doctor know.', 'Link With Polymyalgia Rheumatica About half of people with giant cell arteritis have polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) as well. PMR is an inflammatory condition that also causes swelling, but in your joints. Symptoms include stiffness and aching in your arms, neck, lower back, and thighs. It can be treated with medication and usually goes away within a few years. It’s not clear how or why the two conditions are related.', 'Diagnosis Your doctor will do an exam and ask about your symptoms. They’ll also look for swelling and a weak pulse in the temporal artery in your scalp.', ""You may need a biopsy of the temporal artery. If so, your doctor will numb an area of your scalp and remove a small piece of the temporal artery. A doctor will then check it under a microscope. The cells of an inflamed artery look very large under the microscope. Your doctor also might do one or more of these: Blood test. A sample is taken to check for signs of inflammation in your body. CT scan (computerized tomography). Several X-rays taken from different angles are put together to show more information about your arteries. MRI scan (magnetic resonance imaging). Powerful magnets and radio waves are used to make detailed images of your arteries. When arteries are inflamed, blood can't move as easily through them. Giant cell arteritis can keep oxygen from getting to your eyes, and this can damage them. You might need to see an eye doctor to check for this."", ""Treatment If you have giant cell arteritis, your doctor will start you on medication right away to prevent vision loss and other problems. The main treatment is high doses of steroids, such as prednisone, to reduce inflammation in the arteries. You'll take this medication by mouth every day."", 'Most people stay on a steroid for 1 to 2 years. Your doctor will do blood tests every few months to see if the inflammation in your arteries has gone down. As it does, your doctor will lower the dose of your medicine. These medications can weaken your bones, so your doctor might suggest regular bone mineral density tests. Your doctor may suggest you take calcium and vitamin D supplements, along with a prescription drug called a bisphosphonate, to slow down or prevent bone damage. Other medications that may be used include methotrexate, a drug commonly used to treat cancer as well as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, and a biologic drug called tocilizumab (Actemra). Tocilizumab is given as an injection under the skin to lessen the amount of steroids a person needs. This medicine may be used along with steroids. You also might take aspirin to thin your blood and prevent clots.']"
26,What Is Astrocytoma?,"['Astrocytoma is the most common a type of glioma tumor that \xa0can develop in the brain and spinal cord. It’s more common in men than women and most often shows up after age 45. There are several types of astrocytoma, and some grow faster than others. They get their name from astrocytes, the star-shaped cells where they form in the brain . About 50% of primary brain tumors are astrocytomas. Read on to learn more about symptoms, types, and treatments.', 'Symptoms As the astrocytoma grows and presses against the brain , it can cause symptoms. They depend partly on where and how big your tumor is. Early symptoms include: Headaches Blurry vision Seizures Memory loss Nausea and vomiting Changes in behavior', 'Grades and Types Like other tumors, astrocytomas are graded on a scale of I\xa0to IV, based on how abnormal the cells look and how fast they grow. Grade IV tumors are the most aggressive in their growth. Most astrocytomas in adults are high grade. This means the cells look abnormal and grow quickly. There are several types of astrocytoma: Anaplastic astrocytomas are rare. They are grade III\xa0tumors\xa0that grow quickly and spread to nearby tissue. They are hard to remove completely because of their tentacle-like fingers, which grow into nearby brain tissue. Glioblastomas are also called grade IV\xa0astrocytomas. Over 50% of\xa0astrocytomas are glioblastomas. They grow very quickly and are hard to treat because they are often a mix of different cancer cell types. Diffuse astrocytomas can grow into nearby tissue, but they grow slowly. They are considered low-grade (grade II), but they can develop into higher-grade tumors. Pineal astrocytic tumors can be any grade. They form around the pineal gland. This tiny organ in the cerebrum makes melatonin, which helps control sleep and waking. Brain stem gliomas are rare in adults. It doesn’t happen often, but sometimes gliomas can form in the brain stem, the part that connects to the spinal cord. Pilocytic astrocytomas and subependymal giant cell astrocytomas are more common in children and considered grade I.', ""Treatments You and your doctor will make a treatment plan based on the type of astrocytoma you have, where it is, how fast it's growing, and your symptoms. Surgery to remove all of a tumor -- or as much as possible -- is a likely first step. The exception is gliomas in\xa0 areas where surgery can be too risky. Surgery may be enough to cure grade 1 tumors. Surgery usually doesn’t remove all of a higher-grade tumor. Radiation often follows in case parts of a tumor could not be removed or surgeons can’t be sure they got all of the cancer . Chemotherapy is often used for glioblastoma and anaplastic astrocytoma. It can be used before or after radiation.\xa0In some cases, chemotherapy wafers may be implanted during surgery. Targeted therapy is a newer type of treatment that may be used to help shrink tumors. This works\xa0differently from\xa0chemotherapy in that it targets\xa0certain proteins that help tumors grow. Electric-field therapy uses electrical fields to target cells in the tumor while not damaging normal cells. It's done by putting electrodes directly on the scalp. The device is called Optune. It's given with chemotherapy after surgery and radiation. The FDA has approved it for both newly diagnosed people and people whose glioblastoma has come back.""]"
27,What Is Glioblastoma?,"['Glioblastoma is a type of brain cancer . It’s the most common type of malignant brain tumor among adults. And it is usually very aggressive, which means it can grow fast and spread quickly. Although there is no cure, there are treatments to help ease symptoms.', ""Where It Forms in the Brain Glioblastoma is a type of astrocytoma , a cancer that forms from star-shaped cells in the brain called astrocytes. In adults, this cancer usually starts in the cerebrum, the largest part of your brain . Glioblastoma tumors make their own blood supply, which helps them grow. It's easy for them to invade normal brain tissue."", 'How Common Is It? Brain cancers aren’t common. And when they do happen, about 4 out of 5 aren’t glioblastomas. Men are more likely to get them than women. And chances go up with age. Doctors diagnose about 14,000 glioblastoma cases in the U.S. each year.', 'Symptoms Because glioblastomas grow quickly, pressure on the brain usually causes the first symptoms. Depending on where the tumor is, it can cause: Constant headaches Seizures Vomiting Trouble thinking Changes in mood or personality Double or blurred vision Trouble speaking', 'Causes and Risk Factors Experts aren’t exactly sure what causes glioblastoma. But certain things may make you more likely to have one, such as: Prior radiation to the head. If you previously got radiation to treat brain tumors or cancers that may have spread to the area, it can increase your risk for glioblastoma. Rare genetic conditions. If you have hereditary disorders linked to genetic mutations such as: Turcot syndrome Neurofibromatosis type 1 Li-Fraumeni syndrome Exposure to chemicals and other cancer-causing agents may also increase your risk for genetic mutations. Age and gender. It’s more common among those who are 50 or above. The average age for diagnosis is 64. Men are more likely to have it. Race. It’s more common among white people than among Black, Asian, and Indigenous groups.', 'Types There are two types: Primary glioblastoma. It makes up around 90% of the cases. This type of tumor tends to be aggressive and grows fast. It’s more likely to affect older people. You’re also likely to have a shorter life expectancy. Secondary glioblastoma. This type usually develops from a low-grade glioma – a type of tumor found in the brain or spinal cord. It’s more likely to affect younger people, and it’s usually in the frontal lobe of the brain. The survival rate for this type tends to be better than for primary glioblastoma.', 'Diagnosis A neurologist (a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating brain disorders) will give you a complete exam. You may get an MRI or CT scan and other tests, depending on your symptoms.', 'Stages Doctors don’t group glioblastoma by stages. Instead, they give all brain cancers a “grade.” It ranges from 1 to 4. The grade is based on how the cancer cells look under a microscope and how likely they are to reproduce. Glioblastomas are always recognized as grade 4 brain cancer. That’s because this type is very aggressive and the cancer cells multiply quickly.', 'Treatment The goal of glioblastoma treatment is to slow and control tumor growth and help you live as comfortably and as well as possible. There are four treatments, and many people get more than one type: Surgery is the first treatment. The surgeon tries to remove as much of the tumor as possible. In high-risk areas of the brain, it may not be possible to remove all of it.', ""Radiation is used to kill as many leftover tumor cells as possible after surgery. It can also slow the growth of tumors that can't be removed by surgery. Chemotherapy may also help. Temozolomide is the most common chemotherapy drug doctors use for glioblastoma. Carmustine (BCNU) and lomustine (CCNU) are other chemotherapy drugs that might be used. Targeted therapy with the drug bevacizumab ( Avastin , Mvasi) may be given if chemotherapy has not been effective. Convection-enhanced delivery (CED) uses a pump to release a slow, continuous stream of chemotherapy or targeted therapies to a tumor. Electric field therapy uses electrical fields to target cells in the tumor while not hurting normal cells. To do this, doctors put electrodes directly on the scalp. The device is called Optune. You get it with chemotherapy after surgery and radiation. The FDA has approved it for both newly diagnosed people and people whose glioblastoma has come back. Wafer therapy (Gliadel) uses an implanted, biodegradable disc that releases chemotherapy to any cancerous tissue that is left after surgery. Nanoparticle therapy uses tiny particles to carry chemotherapy directly into the tumor."", 'At major cancer centers, you may also be able to get experimental treatments or oral chemotherapy, which you take at home. These treatments may help with symptoms and possibly put the cancer into remission in some people. In remission, symptoms may let up or disappear for a time. Glioblastomas often regrow. If that happens, doctors may be able to treat it with surgery and a different form of radiation and chemotherapy. Palliative care is also important for anyone with a serious illness. It includes taking care of your pain and the emotions you may be dealing with, as well as other symptoms from your cancer. The goal is to improve the quality of your life. You may also want to ask your doctor if there’s a clinical trial that would be a good fit for you.', 'Outlook and Survival Rates Many things can affect how well someone does when they have cancer, including glioblastomas. Doctors often can’t predict what someone’s life expectancy will be if they have a glioblastoma. But they do have statistics that track how large groups of people who’ve had these conditions tend to do over time.', 'For glioblastoma, the survival rates are: One year: 25% Two years: 8-12% Five years: 5% These numbers can’t predict what will happen to an individual, though. A person’s age, type of tumor, and overall health play a role. As treatments improve, people newly diagnosed with these aggressive brain tumors may have a better outcome.', 'Glioma vs. Glioblastoma Glioma is one the most common types of primary brain cancer. It’s an umbrella term for tumors that develop from glue-like cells known as glial cells that surround nerve cells in your brain or spinal cord. Glioblastoma is a type of glioma. All advanced forms of glioma, also known as grade 4 glioma, are called glioblastoma, the most aggressive type of glioma.']"
28,Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD),"[""What Is Interstitial Lung Disease? Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a group of many lung conditions. All interstitial lung diseases affect the interstitium, a part of your lungs . The interstitium is a lace-like network of tissue that goes throughout both lungs . It supports your lungs' tiny air sacs, called alveoli. Normally, the interstitium is so thin that it doesn’t show up on X-rays or CT scans."", 'Types of Interstitial Lung Disease All forms of interstitial lung disease cause the interstitium to thicken. This can happen from inflammation , scarring, or a buildup of fluid. Some forms of ILD last a short time (acute); others are long-term (chronic) and don’t go away. Some types of interstitial lung disease include: Interstitial pneumonia . Bacteria, viruses, or fungi can infect the interstitium. A bacteria called Mycoplasma\xa0pneumoniae is the most common cause. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis . This makes scar tissue grow in the interstitium. \xa0Experts don’t know what causes it. Nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis. This is an interstitial lung disease that often affects people with autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis or scleroderma . Hypersensitivity pneumonitis . This happens when dust, mold , or other things that you breathe irritate your lungs over a long time. Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP). COP is a pneumonia-like interstitial lung disease without an infection. You might hear your doctor call this bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia (BOOP). Acute interstitial pneumonitis. This is a sudden, severe interstitial lung disease. People who have it often need to be connected to a machine called a ventilator that breathes for them. Desquamative interstitial pneumonitis. This is an interstitial lung disease that partly results from smoking . Sarcoidosis . This causes interstitial lung disease along with swollen lymph nodes . It can also affect your heart , skin , nerves, and eyes . Asbestosis. This is an interstitial lung disease caused by\xa0breathing asbestos, a fiber used in building materials.', 'Interstitial Lung Disease Symptoms The most common symptom of all forms of interstitial lung disease is shortness of breath. Almost everyone with ILD will have breathlessness, which can get worse over time. Other symptoms of interstitial lung disease include: Cough , which is usually dry and doesn’t bring up mucus. Weight loss , most often in people with COP or BOOP. With most forms of ILD, shortness of breath develops slowly (over months). If you have interstitial pneumonia or acute interstitial pneumonitis, your symptoms will come on quickly (in hours or days).', 'Interstitial Lung Disease Causes and Risks The cause of most interstitial lung disease is unknown. Bacteria, viruses, and fungi can cause interstitial pneumonia. You can also get ILD if you regularly breathe in things that can bother your lungs. These include: Asbestos Bird proteins (such as from exotic birds, chickens, or pigeons) Coal dust or various other metal dusts from working in mining Grain dust from farming Silica dust Talc It’s rare, but certain drugs can cause ILD: Some antibiotics, like nitrofurantoin Some anti-inflammatory drugs, like rituximab Chemotherapy drugs like bleomycin Heart medications such as amiodarone Anyone can get interstitial lung disease, but some things can put you at higher risk: Age. Adults are much more likely to get ILD, but children can, too. Autoimmune disease like lupus , rheumatoid arthritis , and scleroderma Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) Genetics. Some conditions are passed down among family members. Smoking Radiation treatments for cancer', 'Interstitial Lung Disease Diagnosis People with interstitial lung disease usually go to the doctor because of shortness of breath or\xa0a cough . Your doctor will probably use imaging tests of your lungs to find out the problem. Chest X-ray. A simple chest X-ray is the first test for most people with a breathing problem. Chest X-rays in people with interstitial lung disease may show fine lines in the lungs. CT scan . A CT scan takes multiple X-rays of the chest, and a computer creates detailed images of the lungs and surrounding structures. These tests can usually find interstitial lung disease. High-resolution CT scan. If your doctor thinks you have an interstitial lung disease, certain CT scan settings can get better-quality images of your interstitium. This can help your doctor diagnose you. Lung function test. You sit in a sealed plastic booth and breathe through a tube to measure your total lung capacity, which might be reduced if you have ILD. You may also be less able to transfer oxygen from your lungs into your blood. Lung biopsy . Looking at lung tissue under a microscope is often the only way for a doctor to know which type of interstitial lung disease you have. Lung tissue is collected in a procedure called a lung biopsy, which can be done several ways: Bronchoscopy . Your doctor will run a tube called an endoscope through your mouth or nose and into your airways. Tiny tools on the endoscope can take a sample of lung tissue. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). Your doctor will make small cuts to insert tools that take samples from multiple areas of lung tissue. Open lung biopsy ( thoracotomy ). In some cases, you might need traditional surgery with a large incision in the chest to get a lung biopsy.', 'Treatments for Interstitial Lung Disease The treatment you get depends on the type of ILD you have and its cause. Antibiotics . These treat most interstitial pneumonias.\xa0Pneumonias caused by a virus usually get better on their own. Pneumonias caused by a fungus are rare but are treated with antifungal drugs. Corticosteroids. In some forms of interstitial lung disease, inflammation in your lungs causes damage and scarring. Corticosteroids\xa0cause your immune system’s activity to slow. This lessens the amount of inflammation in your lungs and the rest of your body. Inhaled oxygen. If you have low oxygen levels because of interstitial lung disease, inhaled oxygen may help your symptoms. Regular use of oxygen might also protect your heart from damage caused by low oxygen levels. Lung transplant . In advanced interstitial lung disease that has severely impaired you, you may need a lung transplant. Most people who have a lung transplant for interstitial lung disease make large gains in their quality of life and their ability to exercise.', 'Azathioprine (Imuran). This drug also slows down the immune system. It’s not shown to improve interstitial lung disease, but some studies suggest it might help. N- acetylcysteine (Mucomyst). This potent antioxidant may slow the decline of lung function in some forms of interstitial lung disease. You’ll take it in combination with other treatments. Other drugs are considered controversial for interstitial lung disease treatment, including: Cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) Cyclosporine Methotrexate Nintedanib (Ofev) Pirfenidone (Esbriet) These medicines affect the way your immune system works. If your doctor thinks you need one, they’ll keep a close watch on you while you’re taking it. These medications can have serious side effects.', 'Interstitial Lung Disease Complications The complications of severe interstitial lung disease can be life threatening: High blood pressure in your lungs, known as pulmonary hypertension Respiratory failure Right-sided heart failure, known as cor pulmonale']"
29,What Is Retinoschisis?,"['Retinoschisis refers to the separation of the layers of the retina. The retina is the tissue inside the back of the eye that changes what you see into electrical signals that travel to the brain. When the retina splits, tiny lumps called cysts form between the layers. These cysts damage nerves and keep light signals from reaching the brain. Damaged nerves can make your vision blurry. There are two forms of this condition: Juvenile X-linked retinoschisis Degenerative (senile) retinoschisis', ""Juvenile X-Linked Retinoschisis This rare condition, sometimes called XJR, mainly affects boys and men. It damages an area in the middle of the retina called the macula. The macula gives you clear central vision, and lets you focus on things in front of you, like a book or computer. Sometimes the condition also can affect your side, or peripheral, vision. Causes XJR is caused by a change -- or mutation -- to a gene. If a girl gets the problem gene from a parent, they’ll carry the disorder but won't have symptoms. If a boy gets the gene, they’ll have the disorder."", ""If a mother has the gene, their female children have a 50% chance of being a carrier. Their male children have a 50% chance of having the disorder. Men who have the gene can't pass it to their sons, but their daughters will be carriers. Symptoms XJR starts at birth and usually affects both eyes. Symptoms can appear in the first few months of life. Some boys, though, aren't diagnosed until they start school and have trouble reading. Their vision often gets worse during childhood and then levels off for a while. When a man reaches their 50s and 60s, their vision might start to worsen again. Some people lose a lot of their vision by adulthood, but it's rare for retinoschisis to cause blindness. Other symptoms include: Eyes that look in different directions ( strabismus ) Poor close-up vision ( farsightedness ) Bleeding in your eye caused by damaged blood vessels In rare cases, the retina will pull away from the eye completely. This is called retinal detachment , and it can lead to serious vision loss. People who have retinal detachment will need surgery to fix it."", 'Diagnosis Your eye doctor will look for splits or tears in your retina. Tests for juvenile X-linked retinoschisis include: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) : Light waves make pictures of the retina. Ultrasound : Sound waves create pictures of the eyes. This can show bleeding in the eye. Electroretinogram (ERG): This measures electrical activity in the retina. A special sensor is placed in each eye. While you look at a flashing light, the doctor will see how your retinas respond. Gene tests: These look for the\xa0RS1 gene that causes juvenile X-linked retinoschisis. People with juvenile retinoschisis should get regular eye exams to check for vision loss. Treatment No medicine or surgery can treat a divided retina. Glasses can’t do much if your vision is bad because of nerve damage, but they can help if you’re nearsighted (can’t see far away) or farsighted. Large-print textbooks, computer screens, and other low-vision tools can help children in school. Bleeding in your eye is treated with a laser or with cold (cryotherapy) to close damaged blood vessels in the retina. Surgery can fix a detached retina. Researchers are testing new treatments for retinoschisis. One of these replaces the damaged gene with a copy of a healthy gene. Stem cell treatments are also being studied.', ""Degenerative Retinoschisis (Senile Retinoschisis) This form, sometimes called SR, usually affects men and women in their 50s to 70s, but it can start earlier in life. It’s not as serious as the juvenile form and rarely causes vision loss. Causes SR isn't caused by a problem gene, and it's not passed down through families. Doctors don't know exactly why the retina becomes damaged as some people get older. Symptoms SR doesn't usually cause vision loss or other symptoms and, typically, is only found during an eye exam. Over time, some people lose a little of their side vision. In rare cases, the retina can become detached. Diagnosis Tests your eye doctor might recommend include: Visual acuity test to check how well you can focus Field of vision test to measure your central and side vision Ophthalmoscopy with dilation to look at the back of your eye, including the retina Slit lamp exam to get a large, three-dimensional (3-D) view of the different parts of your eye"", ""Treatment People with degenerative retinoschisis usually don't need treatment. See your eye doctor for regular checkups to make sure you don’t have any vision loss. If the retina detaches, your doctor will treat it with surgery.""]"
30,Hives and Your Skin,"[""Urticaria, also known as\xa0hives, is an outbreak of pale red bumps or welts on the\xa0skin\xa0that appear suddenly. The swelling that often comes with hives is called angioedema. Allergic reactions, chemicals in certain foods,\xa0insect stings, sunlight, and\xa0medications\xa0can cause hives. It's often impossible to find out exactly why hives have formed."", 'What Causes Hives? There are several types of hives, including: Acute urticaria. These are hives that last less than 6 weeks. The most common causes are foods, medications, and infections. Insect bites and diseases may also be responsible. The most common foods that cause hives are nuts,\xa0chocolate, fish, tomatoes, eggs, fresh berries, and milk. Fresh foods cause hives more often than cooked foods. Certain\xa0food additives\xa0and preservatives may also be to blame. Drugs that can cause hives include\xa0aspirin\xa0and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications such as\xa0ibuprofen, high\xa0blood pressure drugs\xa0(especially ACE inhibitors), or painkillers such as codeine. Chronic urticaria. These are hives that last more than 6 weeks. The cause is usually harder to identify than those causing acute urticaria. For most people with chronic urticaria, the cause is impossible to find. In some cases, though, the cause may be thyroid ,\xa0hepatitis, infection, or\xa0cancer.', 'Chronic urticaria can also affect organs such as the\xa0lungs, muscles, and gastrointestinal tract. Symptoms include shortness of breath, muscle soreness, vomitin g , and\xa0diarrhea. Physical urticaria. These hives are caused by something that stimulates the skin -- for example, cold, heat, sun exposure, vibration, pressure,\xa0sweating, or\xa0exercise. The hives usually occur right where the skin was stimulated and rarely appear elsewhere. Most of the hives appear within 1 hour. Dermatographism. This is a common form of physical urticaria where hives form after firmly stroking or scratching the skin. These hives can also occur along with other forms of urticaria.', ""The Link to Contact Dermatitis Contact dermatitis is a painful or itchy rash you get after your skin touches something you're allergic to (allergic contact dermatitis) or that's otherwise irritating to your skin (irritant contact dermatitis). It's not the same as hives. But sometimes people with contact dermatitis also get hives after they come into contact with an allergen."", ""How Are Hives Diagnosed? Your doctor will need to ask many questions in an attempt to find the possible cause of hives. Since there are no specific tests for hives -- or the associated swelling of angioedema -- testing will depend on your medical history and a thorough exam by your doctor. Your doctor may do skin tests\xa0to find out what you're allergic to. Or they may test your blood to see if you have an illness."", ""How Are Hives Treated? The best treatment for hives is to find and remove the trigger, but this is not an easy task. Antihistamines are usually prescribed by your doctor to provide relief from symptoms.\xa0Antihistamines\xa0work best if taken on a regular schedule to prevent hives from forming in the first place. Chronic hives may be treated with antihistamines or a combination of medications. When antihistamines don't provide relief, oral steroids may be prescribed. A biologic drug,\xa0omalizumab\xa0(Xolair), is also approved to treat chronic hives in people at least 12 years old. For severe hives,\xa0you might need an injection of\xa0epinephrine or a\xa0cortisone\xa0medication."", ""How Can Hives Be Managed?

31,Giardiasis,"['What Is Giardiasis? Giardiasis, also known as a giardia infection, is an intestinal disease marked by diarrhea , cramps , nausea , and bloating . A tiny parasite called Giardia intestinalis causes the infection. This bug lives all around the world in places that don’t have clean drinking water . It’s a common cause of waterborne illness in the U.S.', 'Giardiasis Symptoms Symptoms usually start 1-3 weeks after you’re exposed. They’ll probably last for 2-6 weeks. The most common include: Diarrhea Gas or flatulence Greasy stool that floats Stomach or abdominal cramps Upset stomach or nausea Dehydration Weight loss When should I call a doctor? If you have any of these symptoms for more than a week, call your doctor to see if you should be tested for giardiasis. It’s possible for a giardia infection to get better on its own, but you may need to have treatment.', 'Giardiasis Causes You usually pick up a giardia infection from the stool of an infected person or animal. Before they’re pooped out, the parasites grow a hard shell called a cyst. It helps them live for months outside of a body, either in water or on a surface. The infection comes after you come in contact with the parasite or a cyst. You might: Come into close contact with someone who has giardiasis Touch contaminated surfaces like bathroom handles, changing tables, diaper pails, or toys, then eat without washing your hands Drink water or use ice made from an untreated water source -- like a lake, stream, or well -- that’s home to giardia Swallow the parasite while you swim or play in water Eat uncooked food that contains giardia Travel to countries where it’s common', 'Giardiasis Risk Factors While anyone can catch giardiasis, some people are more likely to come in contact with the parasite: Parents and child care workers who change diapers Children in child care centers People who live in the same household as someone with giardiasis Those who drink water or use ice made from untreated water Backpackers, hikers, and campers who drink unsafe water or who don’t practice good hygiene (like proper handwashing ) on the trail International travelers People who have anal sex', 'Giardiasis Diagnosis To find out if you have giardiasis, you’ll need to give your doctor a stool sample. They’ll send it to a lab for testing. For the best results, you may need to give samples for testing for several days. If you do have giardiasis, you’ll need to have your stool checked again to see if the parasites have cleared.', 'Giardiasis Treatment Many people get better without treatment. But your doctor may want to treat you with medication . Metronidazole ( Flagyl ), nitazoxanide ( Alinia ), and tinidazole ( Tindamax ) are among the drugs used to treat giardia infections.', 'Giardiasis Complications Giardiasis can cause problems even after the infection has gone away. These can be especially serious in infants and children. Dehydration. This is when your body doesn’t have enough water to work normally. It’s often the result of severe diarrhea. Failure to thrive. Long-term diarrhea can affect a child’s mental and physical growth. Lactose intolerance . Many people who have a giardia infection find they can’t digest milk sugar (lactose) the way they used to. This can make it hard to eat milk, cheese , and other dairy foods.', 'Giardiasis Prevention There isn’t a vaccine to prevent it, but there are steps you can take: Wash your hands after you use the toilet, after you change diapers, and before you eat or prepare food. Filter or boil water if you’re outdoors. Try not to swallow water when you swim in a pool, lake, or stream. Drink bottled water when you travel to places with unsafe water. And don’t use ice cubes. Use a condom if you have anal sex.']"
32,Gilbert Syndrome,"[""What Is Gilbert’s Syndrome? Gilbert’s syndrome (also called constitutional hepatic dysfunction or familial nonhemolytic jaundice)\xa0is a common disorder that's passed through families. When you have it, too much of a waste product called bilirubin builds up in your blood . It can make your skin and eyes look yellow from time to time. Gilbert’s syndrome looks scarier than it is. It's a harmless condition that doesn't need to be treated."", 'Gilbert’s Syndrome Causes and Risk Factors It happens when a gene called UGT1A1 changes, or mutates. This gene carries instructions for making a liver enzyme that helps break down and get rid of the bilirubin in your body. Parents pass UGT1A1 gene mutations to their children. You need two copies of the mutated gene -- one from each parent -- to get it. Even if you do have both genes, you might not have Gilbert’s syndrome. Gilbert’s syndrome is more common in men than in women.', ""Gilbert’s Syndrome Symptoms Most people with Gilbert’s syndrome don't have symptoms. They have enough of the liver enzyme to control their bilirubin levels."", 'When bilirubin does build up in the blood , it causes the skin and whites of the eyes to turn yellow. This is called jaundice . See your doctor if you notice a yellow color to your skin and eyes because another condition could be causing it. Jaundice can cause other symptoms such as: Nausea and diarrhea Abdominal discomfort Fatigue Dark urine Jaundice is a common problem in babies. But it’s worse in babies born with Gilbert’s syndrome. Certain things can make your bilirubin levels rise, but you might only notice jaundice when you: Are stressed Are dehydrated Exercise too much Have an infection like the flu Skip meals Drink alcohol Take medicines that affect your liver Are outside in cold weather Have your period Are recovering from surgery', 'Gilbert’s Syndrome Diagnosis Although people are born with Gilbert’s syndrome, sometimes they don’t get diagnosed until their 20s or 30s. You may have a blood test for another reason and your doctor may notice you have high bilirubin levels, which may be a clue that you have the syndrome. They may do more tests to diagnose you, including: A liver ultrasound or liver function tests to rule out other problems Gene tests to see if you have the UGT1A1 gene mutation A liver biopsy (rarely done)', ""Gilbert’s Syndrome Treatments and Home Remedies Most people with Gilbert’s syndrome don't need treatment. Jaundice doesn't cause any long-term problems. To prevent it, try to avoid things that make your bilirubin levels rise. For instance: Don't skip meals. Drink plenty of fluids. Use relaxation techniques or other methods to manage stress . Get a good night's sleep . Limit your alcoholic drinks. Skip long and strenuous workouts. The same liver enzyme that breaks down bilirubin also breaks down certain medicines, including: Acetaminophen Irinotecan ( Camptosar ), a cancer\xa0drug Protease inhibitor drugs used to treat HIV and hepatitis C Monoclonal antibodies used to treat autoimmune diseases If you have Gilbert’s syndrome and you take any of these drugs, you're at higher risk for side effects like diarrhea . Ask your doctor before you take any new medicine. And don't take more than the recommended dose.""]"
33,Gingivitis and Periodontal Disease (Gum Disease),"['What Is Gum Disease? Gums are the tissues that surround your teeth and hold them in place. Gum disease is an infection of this tissue. Your dentist might call it periodontal disease or periodontitis. Gum disease starts when bacteria grow in your mouth. Bacteria build up when you don’t brush your teeth or floss well enough. Without treatment, gum disease can cause swelling, redness, pain, and tooth loss. Almost half of adults ages 30 and older have signs of gum disease. About 9% of adults have severe gum disease.', ""Gingivitis vs. Periodontitis Gingivitis is swelling, redness, and bleeding in the part of your gums that surround your teeth. It's a milder form of gum disease that can lead to periodontitis if you don't treat it. When you forget to brush, floss, and rinse with mouthwash, a sticky film of bacteria and food called plaque builds up around your teeth . The gunk releases acids that attack your teeth’s outer shell, called enamel, and cause decay. After 72 hours, plaque hardens into tartar , which forms along the gumline and makes it hard to clean your teeth and gums completely. Over time, this buildup irritates and inflames your gums, causing gingivitis."", 'If you have periodontitis, the inner layer of the gum and bone pull away from the teeth and form pockets. These small spaces between the teeth and gums collect debris and can become infected. The body\'s immune system fights the bacteria as the plaque spreads and grows below the gumline. Toxins or poisons – produced by the bacteria in plaque as well as the body\'s ""good"" enzymes involved in fighting infections – start to break down the bone and connective tissue that hold teeth in place. As the disease gets worse, the pockets deepen and more gum tissue and bone are destroyed. When this happens, teeth are no longer anchored in place, they become loose, and tooth loss occurs. Gum disease is the leading cause of tooth loss in adults. You can prevent or reverse gingivitis if you brush your teeth, floss, and have regular dental cleanings and checkups.', 'Periodontal Disease Stages Periodontal disease has four stages. It starts with mild swelling and redness of the gums and can lead to bone damage and tooth loss.', 'Gingivitis At this early stage of periodontal disease, your gums may be red and swollen. They might bleed when you brush your teeth. But your bones are still in place. You can reverse gum disease at this stage. Mild periodontitis Now the bacteria have gotten underneath your gums and reached your bones. Your gums might pull away from your teeth and create pockets. Plaque and bacteria fill those pockets and damage your teeth even more. Moderate periodontitis Bacteria eat away at the gum and bone that hold your teeth in place. Your gums might hurt. You may see pus around your gumline, which is a sign of infection. Advanced periodontitis The bone and tissue around your teeth are more damaged. In time, your teeth may get loose and fall out.', ""Gum Disease Causes Plaque is the main cause of gum disease. Gingivitis happens like this: Bacteria collect on your teeth after you eat sweet or starchy foods. If you don't brush and floss well, those bacteria form a sticky film called plaque on your teeth. Plaque turns into a hard deposit called tartar along your gums. Tartar traps bacteria on your teeth. The bacteria cause even more tooth damage. Your gums get irritated, red, and swollen. They may bleed when you brush your teeth."", ""After you've had gingivitis for a while, your gums may pull away from your teeth and form pockets. These small spaces can fill with bacteria, plaque, and tartar and become infected. The infection breaks down the bone and connective tissue that hold your teeth in place. After a while, your teeth may get loose enough to fall out. Gum disease is the most common cause of tooth loss in adults. Things like these increase your risk of gum disease: Hormone changes during pregnancy, puberty, menopause, and periods leave gums more sensitive, and make it easier for gingivitis to develop. Diseases like cancer, HIV, and diabetes increase the risk of infections, including periodontal disease. Some medicines reduce the saliva that protects your teeth and gums, including drugs that prevent seizures and that treat a type of chest pain called angina. Smoking makes it harder for gum tissue to repair itself. Poor oral hygiene habits such as not brushing and flossing every day can lead to gingivitis. A family history of dental disease increases your risk of gum disease."", ""Gum Disease Symptoms Although the symptoms of periodontal disease could be hard to spot, there usually are warning signs. The most common symptoms of gum disease include: Gums that bleed when you brush your teeth Red, swollen gums (healthy gums should be pink and firm) Pain or tenderness in the gums Bad breath or a bad taste in your mouth that doesn't go away Pain when you chew Sensitive teeth Pus between your teeth Gums that pull away from your teeth (receding gums) Deep pockets between the teeth and gums Loose teeth or teeth that fall out Spaces between your teeth that look like black triangles Changes in the way your teeth fit together when you bite In some people, gum disease may affect only certain teeth, such as the molars. Only a dentist or periodontist can tell you for sure that you have gum disease. Is periodontal disease contagious? It can be. Bacteria cause gum disease. Those bacteria can pass through saliva if you kiss someone who has gum disease or share utensils with them. You can't catch periodontal disease just from being close to someone."", ""Gum Disease Diagnosis A dentist diagnoses gum disease. During a dental exam, the dentist will ask about your symptoms and look for: Bleeding, swollen gums Pockets between your gums and teeth Receding gums A change in your bite Loose teeth Your dentist may refer you to a gum specialist called a periodontist for more tests and treatment. The dentist or periodontist uses a small ruler called a periodontal probe to measure the pockets around your teeth. The bigger the pockets, the more bone you've lost. Dental X-rays can show bone loss more clearly."", ""Gum Disease Treatment The goals of gum disease treatment are to help your gums reattach to your teeth, reduce swelling, and stop the disease from getting worse. Which treatment plan your dentist or periodontist suggests depends on: How severe your gum disease is What treatments you've already tried How healthy you are Whether you smoke Options include nonsurgical treatments to control bacteria and surgery to fix the tissues that support your teeth."", ""Nonsurgical treatments Mild periodontitis can be treated without surgery, using procedures like these: Scaling is like a dental cleaning, only it cleans more deeply under your gums. A dental hygienist uses instruments, a laser, or sound waves to remove tartar, plaque, and bacteria from your teeth. Root planing smooths out the surface of the root, the part of your tooth that's under your gums. This makes it harder for bacteria and plaque to collect again. It also helps your gums reattach to your teeth. Antibiotic mouth rinses, gels, or pills get rid of the bacteria that caused the infection. Gum disease surgery If you have advanced periodontitis, you may need one of these surgical procedures: Flap surgery. This procedure removes plaque that's deep under your gums. Your periodontist makes small cuts in your gum to create a flap. They clean out any bacteria, tartar, and plaque that's under your gums and smooth out any rough spots on the bone. Your gum goes back in place and is closed with stitches. After flap surgery, it will be easier for you to keep your teeth and gums clean."", 'Soft tissue grafts. The periodontist places gum grafts over spots where your own gums have receded. They take a small piece of tissue from the roof of your mouth or from a donor and attach it to the exposed tooth roots to cover them. Bone grafting. Periodontitis can wear away the bone around your teeth. This procedure implants pieces of your own bone, artificial material, or donated bone in areas where bone has eroded to hold your tooth in place. In time, your own bone will regrow in that area. Guided tissue regeneration (GTR). This procedure is often done together with a bone graft. The periodontist puts a special type of fabric between your gums and the bone graft. The fabric holds the space open so that new bone can grow. Tissue-stimulating proteins. A special protein gel applied to your damaged tooth root helps new, healthy bone and tissue grow. Platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) and platelet-rich plasma (PRP). PRP and PRF speed healing and reduce pain after gum surgery. Your doctor gets PRF and PRP by spinning a small amount of your blood through a machine called a centrifuge. The machine separates out and condenses a protein called fibrin or a liquid called plasma from your blood. The PRF or PRP then goes onto the surgical site to promote healing.', ""Can gum disease be reversed? You can reverse gum disease if you treat it early enough. Once you've lost bone around your teeth, it's not reversible. But you can still slow or stop gum disease with treatment and good oral hygiene."", ""Gum Disease Prevention Gingivitis can be reversed and gum disease can be kept from getting worse in nearly all cases when proper plaque control is practiced. Proper plaque control consists of professional cleanings at least twice a year and daily brushing and flossing. Brush your teeth twice a day. Use a soft-bristled brush and fluoride toothpaste. Replace your toothbrush every 3 months, or sooner if the bristles become frayed. Old, worn-out ones won't clean teeth as well. Brushing gets rid of plaque on the surfaces of the teeth that can be reached. Flossing removes food particles and plaque from in between the teeth and under the gumline. Floss every day. Don’t wait until something gets stuck between your teeth. Daily flossing gets plaque out of places your toothbrush can't reach. You can also try interdental cleaners, picks, or small brushes that fit in between teeth. Ask your dentist how to use them so you don't damage your gums."", ""Rinse your mouth . Antibacterial mouthwash not only prevents gingivitis, it fights bad breath and plaque. Antibacterial rinses can reduce bacteria that cause plaque and gum disease, according to the American Dental Association. Ask your dentist which mouthwash would work best for you. Other health and lifestyle changes can cut the risk of gum disease, lessen how severe it is, and slow how fast it develops. They include: Stop smoking . Not only is smoking bad for your heart and lungs , it can harm your teeth and gums. Smokers are seven times more likely to get gum disease than nonsmokers, and smoking can lower the chances of success of some treatments. Reduce stress. Stress may make it hard for your body's immune system to fight off infection. Maintain a balanced diet. Bacteria in your mouth feed on sugars and starches from food, fueling them to release the acids that attack tooth enamel . Junk food and candy have a lot of extra sugar and starch. Avoid them to keep your teeth and gums healthy. Proper nutrition helps your immune system fight infection. Eating foods with antioxidants – for example, those containing vitamin E (vegetable oils, nuts, green leafy vegetables) and vitamin C (citrus fruits, broccoli, potatoes) – can help your body repair damaged tissue. Avoid clenching and grinding your teeth . These actions may put excess force on the supporting tissues of the teeth and could increase the rate at which these tissues are destroyed."", ""Despite following good oral hygiene practices and making other healthy lifestyle choices, the American Academy of Periodontology says that up to 30% of Americans may be more likely to get gum disease because of their genes. And those who are genetically predisposed may be up to six times more likely to get some form of gum disease. If anyone in your family has gum disease, it may mean that you are at greater risk as well. If you are more likely to have gum disease, your dentist or periodontist may recommend more frequent checkups, cleanings, and treatments to better manage the condition. If it's been 6 months since you last saw the dentist, set up a cleaning to remove tartar and plaque buildup from your teeth. Ask your dentist about the proper way to brush. Bearing down too hard or missing spots can lead to gingivitis. After a cleaning, your gums should get better within a week or so as long as you brush twice a day, and floss and rinse once a day."", 'Is Gum Disease Linked to Other Health Problems? According to the CDC, researchers have uncovered potential links between gum disease and other serious health conditions. In people with a healthy immune system, the bacteria in the mouth that makes its way into the bloodstream is usually harmless. But under certain circumstances, these germs are linked to health problems such as stroke and heart disease. Diabetes is not only a risk factor for gum disease, but gum disease may make diabetes worse.', 'Takeaways Gingivitis is the early stage of gum disease. It can lead to periodontal disease and tooth loss. Good oral hygiene and quick treatment can stop gingivitis and help preserve your teeth.', 'Gum Disease FAQs What can gum disease lead to?

In the U.S., many take ginkgo supplements in the belief that they will improve memory and sharpen thinking.', ""Why do people take ginkgo? Ginkgo improves blood flow to the brain and acts as an antioxidant . These effects may translate into some benefits for certain medical problems, but the results have been mixed. Some studies have found that in healthy people, ginkgo might modestly boost memory and cognitive speed. Other studies have not found a benefit. Several ginkgo studies have suggested it can help with memory problems caused by dementia or Alzheimer’s disease. But the results of the long-term Ginkgo Evaluation of Memory Study done by the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health did not find that it prevented dementia or cognitive decline. The study also failed to show that ginkgo could prevent Alzheimer’s-related dementia from getting worse. There's good evidence that ginkgo might ease leg pain caused by clogged arteries . It might also help with some other circulation problems. In addition, ginkgo may relieve PMS symptoms, like breast tenderness and mood changes. Researchers have studied ginkgo for many other conditions, including ADHD , depression and other psychological conditions, multiple sclerosis, and tinnitus from a vascular origin.

Push the plunger down to inject air into the bottle (this allows the insulin to be drawn more easily). Leave the needle in the bottle. Turn the bottle and syringe upside-down. Be sure the insulin covers the needle. Pull back on the plunger to the required number of units (measure from the top of the plunger). Check the syringe for air bubbles. Air bubbles in the syringe will not harm you if they are injected, but they can reduce the amount of insulin in the syringe. To remove air bubbles, tap the syringe so the air bubbles rise to the top and push up on the plunger to remove the air bubbles. Recheck the dose and add more insulin to the syringe if necessary. Remove the needle from the insulin bottle. Carefully replace the cap on the needle."", 'How to Measure a Mixed Dose of Insulin Your doctor may prescribe two types of insulin to be injected at once for diabetes . This mixed dose may provide better blood sugar control for some people.', 'Please follow these steps when injecting a mixed dose of insulin: Follow the preparation steps described above for both bottles of insulin. Draw the required number of units of air into the syringe by pulling the plunger back. Draw air into the syringe equal to the amount of cloudy (intermediate or long-acting) insulin needed. Always measure from the top of the plunger (the edge closest to the needle). Insert the needle into the rubber stopper of the cloudy insulin bottle. Push the plunger down to inject air into the bottle (this allows the insulin to be drawn more easily). Do not withdraw the insulin into the syringe at this time. Take the needle out of the bottle. Draw the required number of units of air into the syringe by pulling the plunger back. Draw air into the syringe equal to the amount of clear (short-acting) insulin needed. Always measure from the top of the plunger. Insert the needle into the rubber stopper of the clear insulin bottle. Push the plunger down to inject air into the bottle (this allows the insulin to be drawn more easily). Turn the bottle and syringe upside-down. Be sure the insulin covers the needle. Pull back on the plunger to the required number of units of clear insulin needed (measure from the top of the plunger, the edge closest to the needle). Check the syringe for air bubbles. Air bubbles in the syringe will not harm you if they are injected, but they can reduce the amount of insulin in the syringe. To remove air bubbles, tap the syringe so the air bubbles rise to the top and push up on the plunger to remove the air bubbles. Recheck the dose and add more insulin to the syringe if necessary. Remove the needle from the clear insulin bottle and insert it into the rubber stopper of the cloudy insulin bottle. Turn the bottle and syringe upside-down. Be sure the insulin covers the needle. Pull back on the plunger to the required number of total units of insulin needed (measure from the top of the plunger). Important: This must be an exact measurement. If you withdraw too much cloudy insulin, the total dosage in the syringe must be discarded. Be careful not to push any of the clear insulin from the syringe into the cloudy insulin. If there are large air bubbles after mixing the insulin in the syringe, discard this dosage and start the procedure again. Do not push the insulin back into the bottle. Carefully replace the cap on the needle. You are now ready to inject the insulin. Follow the steps listed below.', 'Rotate Insulin Injection Sites Because you will be injecting insulin on a regular basis for diabetes, you need to know where to inject it and how to rotate (move) your injection sites. By rotating your injection sites, you will make your injections easier, safer, and more comfortable. If the same injection site is used over and over again, you may develop hardened areas under the skin that keep the insulin from being used properly. Important: Only use the sites on the front of your body for self-injection. Any of the sites may be used if someone else is giving you the injection. Follow these guidelines: Ask your doctor, nurse, or health educator which sites you should use. Move the site of each injection. Inject at least 1 1/2 inches away from the last injection site. Try to use the same general injection area at the same time of each day (for example, use the abdomen for the injection before lunch). Note: The abdomen absorbs insulin the fastest, followed by the arms, thighs, and buttocks. Keep a record of which injection sites you have used.', 'Select and Clean the Injection Site Choose an injection site for your insulin shot. Do not inject near joints, the groin area, navel, the middle of the abdomen, or near scars. Clean the injection site (about 2 inches of your skin) in a circular motion with an alcohol wipe or a cotton ball dampened with rubbing alcohol. Leave the alcohol wipe or cotton ball nearby.', 'Inject the Insulin Using the hand you write with, hold the barrel of the syringe (with the needle end down) like a pen, being careful not to put your finger on the plunger. Remove the needle cap. With your other hand, gently pinch a two- to three-inch fold of skin on either side of the cleaned injection site. Insert the needle with a quick motion into the pinched skin at a 90-degree angle (straight up and down). The needle should be all the way into your skin. Push the plunger of the syringe until all of the insulin is out of the syringe. Quickly pull the needle out. Do not rub the injection site. You may or may not bleed after the injection. If you are bleeding, apply light pressure with the alcohol wipe. Cover the injection site with a bandage if necessary.', 'Dispose of the Syringe and Needle Do not cap the needle. Drop the entire syringe and needle into your container for used ""sharps"" equipment. When the container is full, put the lid or cover on it and throw it away with the trash. Do NOT put this container in the recycling bin. Some communities have specific disposal laws. Check with your local health department for specific disposal instructions in your community.']"
36,Anaphylaxis and Allergies,"['What Is Anaphylaxis? Anaphylaxis (or ""anaphylactic shock"") is a severe allergic reaction that needs to be treated right away. If you have an anaphylactic reaction, you need a shot of epinephrine (adrenaline) as soon as possible, and someone should call 911 for emergency medical help. Left untreated, it can be deadly. Epinephrine can reverse the symptoms within minutes. If this doesn\'t happen, you may need a second shot within half an hour. These shots, which you need a prescription to get, come pre-filled in ready-to-use pens. You should not take an antihistamine for an anaphylactic reaction. Anaphylaxis is rare, but some people are more likely to have it than others. Most people recover from it. But it\'s important to tell your doctor about any drug or latex allergies you have before any kind of medical treatment, including dental care. It’s also a good idea to wear a medical alert bracelet or pendant or carry a card with information about your allergy. If you\'ve had an anaphylactic reaction before, you have a higher risk of having another one. You also have a higher risk if you have a family history of anaphylaxis or have asthma.', ""4 Stages of Anaphylaxis Anaphylaxis and its symptoms usually happen in stages. But it can worsen fast. Your symptoms are likely mild at first and will get worse over time. By recognizing a reaction early, you can get help before your symptoms are more severe or even life-threatening. These stages include: Stage 1. Your symptoms are mild. You might not know yet if you're having an anaphylactic reaction. It can look like a more mild allergy. You may itch. You may notice your skin is red or bumpy with hives. Your nose may start to run, too. It's a good idea to pay attention to these signs, especially if you know you're at risk for anaphylaxis. Stage 2. Your symptoms are now worse and on more of your body. You may have a rash or hives over a bigger area. Your face, lips, or tongue may swell while your eyes start to water. It may be hard for you to swallow. You also could have belly pain, vomiting, or diarrhea. At this stage, you should get help right away in case your symptoms keep getting worse. Stage 3. As your symptoms get worse, you may have trouble breathing. Your pulse may be weak and you may feel chest pain. You may also notice you're dizzy or lightheaded or even pass out. This stage is sometimes called anaphylactic shock. Stage 4. Your symptoms are now life-threatening. Your blood pressure has dropped and your pulse is weak. Your blood isn't flowing as it should as your airways keep swelling. When your symptoms are most severe, anaphylaxis can lead to heart attack and death."", 'Symptoms of Anaphylaxis The first signs of an anaphylactic reaction may look like typical allergy symptoms : a runny nose or a skin rash . But within about 30 minutes, more serious signs appear. You\'ll usually have more than one of these signs: Coughing or wheezing Pain, itching , or tightness in your chest Fainting , dizziness , confusion, or weakness Hives , a rash , and itchy, swollen, or red skin Runny or stuffy nose and sneezing Shortness of breath or trouble breathing and rapid heartbeat (palpitations) Swollen or itchy lips or tongue Swollen or itchy throat, hoarse voice, trouble swallowing, tightness in your throat Vomiting , diarrhea , \xa0cramps , or belly pain Weak pulse, paleness Slurred speech Unconsciousness Some people also remember feeling a ""sense of doom” right before the attack. Symptoms can move to shock and loss of consciousness. As many as 1 out of every 5 people may have a second anaphylactic reaction within 12 hours of the first. This is called a biphasic anaphylaxis.', 'Causes of Anaphylaxis Anaphylaxis happens when you have an antibody, something that usually fights infection, that reacts too much to something that should be harmless like food. It might not happen the first time you come in contact with the trigger, but it can get worse over time.', ""In children, the most common cause of anaphylaxis is food. For adults, medications more often cause it. Common food triggers for children are: Peanuts Shellfish Fish Milk Eggs Soy Wheat Common food triggers for adults are: Shellfish Tree nuts (walnuts, hazel nuts, cashews, pistachios, pine nuts, and almonds) Peanuts It's rare, but some people are so sensitive that even the smell of the food can trigger a reaction. Some are also allergic to certain preservatives in food. Common medication triggers are: Penicillin (more often following a shot rather than a pill) Muscle relaxants like the ones used for anesthesia Aspirin , ibuprofen , and other NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) Anti- seizure medications Anaphylaxis also can be triggered by a few other things. But these aren’t as common: Pollen , such as ragweed, grass, and tree pollen Stings or bites from bees, wasps, yellow jackets, hornets, and fire ants Latex, found in hospital gloves, balloons, and rubber bands"", 'Some people can have an anaphylactic reaction if they breathe in latex.', 'Some can have a reaction to a combination of things: Breathe in birch pollen and eat apple, raw potato, carrots, celery, or hazelnut Breathe in mugwort pollen and eat celery, apples, peanuts, or kiwi Breathe in ragweed pollen and eat melons or bananas Touch latex and eat papaya, chestnuts, or kiwi In rare cases, it can be triggered by 2 to 4 hours of exercise after eating certain foods or by exercise on its own. Anaphylactic reactions usually start within minutes of contact with the trigger, but they can also happen an hour or more later. Some people never figure out what caused their reactions. That’s known as idiopathic anaphylaxis. If you don’t know your triggers, you can’t avoid them. So it’s especially important to carry epinephrine injectors, make sure you and people close to you know how to use them, and wear medical alert jewelry.', ""Risk Factors for Anaphylaxis You're at more risk for anaphylaxis if you've had it before. Your reactions may get worse every time you have them. Other things that can increase your risk include: Allergies Asthma Other conditions like heart disease Too many white blood cells (mastocytosis)"", ""Anaphylaxis Diagnosis If you think you have serious allergies or are at risk for anaphylaxis, see a doctor. Your doctor will ask you about any signs of allergic reactions you've had. They'll ask if you've seen signs of a reaction from: Foods Medicines Latex Insect bites or stings To find out if you have an allergy that could cause anaphylaxis or may have had an anaphylactic reaction, you may need more tests. These may include: Blood tests. A test can measure how much of an enzyme called tryptase you have in your blood. This enzyme can be at higher levels for up to 3 hours after anaphylaxis. Your doctor may also order blood tests to look for signs of an allergy, such as latex. Skin tests. Skin tests also can look for allergies to foods, chemicals, or other substances. Since other conditions can look like anaphylaxis, your doctor may run other tests to make sure your symptoms aren't a sign of some other health problem."", ""Treatment for Anaphylaxis Epinephrine is the most effective anaphylaxis medication, and the shot should be given right away (usually in the thigh). If you’ve had an anaphylactic reaction before, you should carry at least two doses of epinephrine with you at all times. Epinephrine expires after about a year, so make sure your prescription is up to date. If you have an anaphylactic reaction and the pen has expired, take the shot anyway. When medical personnel arrive, they may give you more epinephrine. If you’re not able to breathe, they may put a tube down your mouth or up your nose to help. If this doesn’t work, they might do a kind of surgery called a tracheostomy that puts the tube directly into your windpipe. Either in the ambulance or at the hospital, you may need fluids and medications to help you breathe. If the symptoms don't go away, doctors may also give you antihistamines and steroids . Other treatments you may need include: Oxygen to help your breathing Intravenous antihistamines or steroids (cortisone) to lower your swelling Albuterol or another beta-agonist to help your breathing more"", ""You probably will need to stay in the emergency room for several hours to make sure you don't have a second reaction. After the initial emergency is over, see an allergy specialist, especially if you don't know what caused the reaction. An allergy specialist may also give you a series of allergy shots to help your body get used to the trigger and make anaphylaxis less likely to happen again."", ""Anaphylaxis Prevention To protect yourself against anaphylaxis, the best way is to find out what caused your reaction and stay away from it. Some other steps to protect yourself include: Medical alert necklace or bracelet. These will alert other people around you to help you avoid your triggers or catch a reaction quickly before it gets worse. Emergency kit. Keep your medicines with you at all times wherever you go. Ask your doctor what you should carry. If you have an epinephrine pen or autoinjector, make sure to get it refilled before your medicine expires. Let your doctors know. Make sure all of your medical and dental providers know about any allergies and your risk for anaphylaxis. Avoid insects. If insect bites or stings are your trigger, take steps to avoid them. Cover up and avoid colors or scents that attract bugs. Don't swat or slap at stinging insects if you do see them. Instead, move away slowly and calmly. Check labels. If food allergies are your trigger, read labels carefully. Ask before you order at restaurants and make sure friends and family know about your allergies and risk for a serious reaction. Even if you do everything possible, you could still come in contact with one of your triggers. If this happens, make sure you and your loved ones and friends know what to do. If you have a plan in place, you can see the signs and symptoms and get help before it gets worse."", 'Anaphylaxis Complications When your anaphylaxis is severe, it can be fatal. It can stop you from breathing. You may not have a heartbeat anymore. Your risk for the most serious complications are even greater if you have other health conditions, such as heart disease, asthma, or other lung diseases. If you are at risk for anaphylaxis, make sure you know the signs and what to do if it happens. By taking steps to avoid your triggers and knowing what to do in the event it happens, you can prevent the worst from happening.']"
37,"Plague: Bubonic, Pneumonic, and Septicemic","[""What Is the Plague? Plague is an infectious disease that affects people and animals. Once called the Black Death, this disease that swept the world hundreds of years ago still lives. And it’s still dangerous. It's caused by bacteria called Yersinia pestis. It’s usually spread by fleas. These bugs pick up the germs when they bite infected animals like rats, mice, or squirrels. Then they pass it to the next animal or person they bite. You can also catch the plague directly from infected animals or people. Fortunately, we know more than our ancestors did about how to handle infectious diseases . These days, with quick treatment, the plague can be cured."", ""Plague Basics Plague can cause swelling in your lymph nodes. The armpit is one of the common places for these bumps, called buboes, to appear. They also show up in the groin and neck. They're tender and painful. (Photo Credit: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/Science Source) Plague spreads easily among people, usually by droplets in the air that come out when infected people sneeze or cough. This can lead to epidemics. Thanks to treatment and prevention, the plague is rare now. Only a few thousand people around the world get it each year. Most of the cases are in Africa (especially the Democratic Republic of Congo and Madagascar), India, and Peru. The U.S. sees about seven cases a year, mostly in rural or remote areas in Southwestern states like Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and California."", ""Plague History Scientists have found DNA signs of the plague in Bronze Age skeletons that are nearly 3,800 years old. The first plague pandemic, called the Justinian plague, struck in the years 541 and 542. Many waves of plague swept Europe and Asia from the 6th to 8th centuries. The second pandemic, the one known as the Black Death, arrived in Italy in 1347. Historians believe it started in Central Asia and came to Europe aboard trading ships, carried by fleas and rats. It spread quickly across Europe, and in the next 5 years, about a third of the continent's population died. This second pandemic ended around 1400, but Europe still had deadly outbreaks in the next 400 years. In the mid-1600s, plague in Italy killed two-thirds of the population of Naples and Genoa, and London lost roughly a quarter of its population. An outbreak in Moscow in 1770 killed about 100,000 people. The third plague pandemic started in southwest China in 1855. It spread from there, killing about 70,000 people in Canton. It reached Japan, Australia, and North and South America in the early 1900s. Experts estimate plague killed 12 million people in India in the late 1800s and early 1900s."", 'Types of Plague There are three main types of plague . Bubonic plague This is usually caused by a flea bite. Within 2 to 8 days, your lymph nodes begin to swell as the bacteria builds up. These swollen glands are called ""buboes."" Septicemic plague It can be caused by a flea bite or by touching an animal that has plague. It can also develop from bubonic plague if it\'s not treated and the bacteria infects your blood. It\'s not clear how long it\'ll take you to start feeling sick, but it\'ll probably happen within days. Pneumonic plague This is the most serious type, and it\'s the only one that can spread from person to person. You can get it from breathing in droplets that come out when an infected person sneezes or coughs. It also can happen when you have bubonic or septicemic plague and the bacteria spreads to your lungs. It takes only 1 to 3 days to become sick.', 'Symptoms of Plague After people catch the plague, the symptoms start 1-8 days later. You feel very sick and weak and may have a fever, chills, and headaches. Other symptoms depend on which of the three kinds of plague you have: Symptoms of bubonic plague This is the most common type. Aside from a fever, headache, and chills, the main symptom is buboes. Those swollen and painful lymph nodes can be under your arms, in your neck, or in your groin. Without treatment, the bacteria can spread to other parts of your body. Symptoms of septicemic plague This type is more dangerous than bubonic plague. Signs include: Bleeding under your skin or from your mouth, nose, or bottom Blackened skin, especially on your nose, fingers, and toes Belly pain, diarrhea, vomiting, and shock Symptoms of pneumonic plague This is the rarest form of the disease. It’s deadly without treatment. Symptoms include: Chest pain Cough ing , sometimes with blood Trouble breathing Nausea and vomiting', 'Causes of Plague The bacteria that causes plague may live in certain animals without causing them to die. Scientists think that creates what they call a ""long-term reservoir,"" or supply, of the bacteria. Plague outbreaks can happen anywhere people come in contact with those reservoirs of bacteria.', ""Some living conditions can make outbreaks of plague more likely. Cities that are overcrowded, lack systems for removing trash and human waste, and have large amounts of rats can be breeding grounds for plague. For most people, the chances of getting the plague are low. But it's more likely if you visit or live in an area with the plague and you: Touch a living or dead animal that might have been infected, like a rat, mouse, squirrel, rabbit, or chipmunk Work with animals regularly Spend a lot of time outdoors working, hiking, camping, or hunting Spend time with someone who has the plague"", ""Plague Diagnosis Your doctor might suspect you've been infected with plague if you have certain symptoms and live in an area where animals are known to carry it or have visited such a place recently."", ""To find out if you have plague, your doctor will take samples from your body. Those could include blood or tissue from a swollen lymph gland. The samples are sent to a lab, which tests them for the bacteria that causes plague. In the past few years, researchers have come up with a rapid test that can spot signs of the plague bacteria within 15 minutes. It tests fluid from infected lymph nodes or that you cough up. It's not widely used, but it could be an important first test in parts of the world where it isn't as easy to get samples tested in a lab."", 'Plague Treatment If you’ve been in an area with the plague and have symptoms, get to a doctor right away. Hours can make a difference. If you’ve been around someone who has the plague, your doctor may start treatment even if you don’t have symptoms. If you must be near the person, wear tight-fitting disposable surgical masks so you won’t breathe in the plague bacteria.', ""If you have the plague, you'll be admitted to the hospital. You'll get antibiotics like: Ciprofloxacin (Cipro) Doxycycline (Vibramycin) Gentamicin (Garamycin) Levofloxacin (Levaquin) Treatment works well. With antibiotics, most people get better within a week or two. But without treatment, most people with the plague die."", 'Plague Prevention There’s no vaccine for the plague in the U.S. So if you have a chance of contact with plague germs, take steps to protect yourself. If you travel to Africa, Asia, or South America, check for traveler notices about plague outbreaks on the CDC website. Avoid areas with the plague if you can, and stay away from sick or dead animals while you’re there. If you live in an area where there’s been a case of the plague: Fill holes and gaps in your home to stop mice, rats, and squirrels from getting in. Clean up your yard. Get rid of piles of leaves, wood, and rocks where animals might make their homes. Use bug repellent with DEET to prevent flea bites when you hike or camp. Wear gloves if you have to touch wild animals, alive or dead. Use flea control sprays or other treatments on your pets. Don’t let outdoor pets like cats or dogs sleep in your bed.']"
38,Glaucoma,"[""What Is Glaucoma? Glaucoma is a condition that damages your\xa0eye's optic nerve, and it gets worse over time. It's often linked to a buildup of pressure inside your\xa0eye. Glaucoma tends to run in families. You usually don’t get it until later in life. The increased pressure in your eye, called intraocular pressure, can damage your optic nerve that sends images to your\xa0brain. If the damage worsens, glaucoma can cause permanent\xa0vision loss or even total blindness within a few years. What glaucoma looks like within the eye. Most people with glaucoma have no early symptoms or pain. Visit your eye doctor regularly so they can diagnose and treat glaucoma before you have long-term vision loss. If you lose vision, it can’t be brought back, but lowering eye pressure can help you keep the sight you have. Most people with glaucoma who follow their treatment plan and have regular eye exams are able to keep their vision."", 'Glaucoma Causes The fluid inside your eye, called aqueous humor, usually flows out of your eye through a mesh-like channel. If this channel gets blocked or the eye is producing too much fluid, the liquid builds up. Sometimes, experts don’t know what causes this blockage, but it can be inherited, meaning it’s passed from parents to children. Less-common causes of glaucoma include a blunt or chemical injury to your eye, severe eye infection , blocked blood vessels inside your eye, and inflammatory conditions. It’s rare, but eye surgery to correct another condition can sometimes bring it on. It usually affects both eyes, but it may be worse in one than the other.', ""Glaucoma Risk Factors Glaucoma mostly affects adults older than 40, but young adults, children, and even infants can have it. African Americans tend to get it more often, at a younger age, and with more vision loss . You’re more likely to get it if you: Are of African American, Irish, Russian, Japanese, Hispanic, Inuit, or Scandinavian descent Are over 40 years old Have a family history of glaucoma Are nearsighted or farsighted Have\xa0poor vision Have diabetes Take certain\xa0steroid\xa0medications such as\xa0prednisone Take certain drugs for\xa0bladder control or\xa0seizures or some over-the-counter\xa0cold remedies Have had an injury to your eye or eyes Have corneas that are thinner than usual Have high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, or sickle cell anemia Have high eye pressure It's important to get a comprehensive dilated eye exam at least once every 2 years. Early detection is critical to preventing vision loss caused by glaucoma. The risk group includes: African Americans over age 40 Everyone over age 60, especially Mexican Americans People with a family history of the disease"", 'Is Glaucoma Hereditary? It can be. Your risk is higher if you have a first-degree relative with the condition. That means you could get glaucoma if your mother, father, or full sister or brother has it. Scientists have identified mutations, or changes, in certain genes that can lead to glaucoma.', 'Types of Glaucoma There are two main types: Open-angle glaucoma . This is the most common type. Your doctor may also call it wide-angle glaucoma. The drain structure in your eye (called the trabecular meshwork) looks fine, but fluid doesn’t flow out the way it should. Angle-closure glaucoma. This is more common in Asia. It is also called acute angle-closure glaucoma, chronic angle-closure glaucoma, or narrow-angle glaucoma Your eye doesn’t drain the way it should because the drain space between your iris and cornea becomes too narrow. This can cause a sudden buildup of pressure in your eye. It’s also linked to\xa0farsightedness and\xa0cataracts – a clouding of the lens inside your eye.', 'Less common types of glaucoma include: Secondary glaucoma. This is when another condition, such as cataracts or diabetes, causes added pressure in your eye.\xa0Inflammation inside your eye (your doctor will call this\xa0uveitis) can cause you to see\xa0halos. Bright lights might bother your eyes. (You’ll hear your doctor call this\xa0light sensitivity or photophobia.) Normal-tension glaucoma. This is when you have blind spots in your vision or your optic nerve is damaged, but your eye pressure is within the average range. Some experts say it’s a form of open-angle glaucoma. Pigmentary glaucoma. With this form, tiny bits of pigment from your iris (the colored part of your eye) get into the fluid inside your eye and clog the drainage canals .', 'Congenital Glaucoma in Infants This usually shows up in newborns or during the\xa0baby’s first few years. Symptoms include: Tearing, sensitivity to light, and eyelid spasms A larger cornea and clouding of the normally transparent cornea Habitual rubbing of the\xa0eyes, squinting, or keeping the eyes closed much of the time', 'Glaucoma Symptoms Open-Angle Glaucoma Most people with open-angle glaucoma don’t have symptoms. If symptoms do show up, they\'re usually late in the disease. That’s why glaucoma is often called the ""sneak thief of vision."" The main sign is usually loss of side, or peripheral, vision. Angle-Closure Glaucoma Symptoms of angle-closure glaucoma usually come on faster and are more obvious. Damage can occur quickly. If you have any of these symptoms, get medical care right away: Seeing halos around lights Vision loss Redness in your eye Eye that looks hazy (particularly in infants) Upset stomach or vomiting Eye pain Severe headache Pigmentary Glaucoma Halos around lights Blurred vision with exercise Gradual loss of side vision Normal Tension Glaucoma No symptoms in early stages Gradually, blurred vision In later stages, loss of side vision', 'What Does Glaucoma Feel Like? Except for acute closed- or narrow-angle glaucoma, most cases of glaucoma cannot be felt, especially in the early stages.\xa0Acute closed- or narrow-angle glaucoma symptoms strike quickly. People often describe it as “the worst\xa0eye pain of my life.” S ymptoms include: Severe throbbing eye pain Eye redness Headaches (on the same side as the affected\xa0eye) Blurry or foggy\xa0vision Halos around lights Dilated pupil Nausea and vomiting', 'This type of\xa0glaucoma is a medical emergency. Go to the emergency room right away. Damage to the optic nerve may begin within a few hours, and if not treated within 6 to 12 hours, it may bring\xa0very serious, permanent loss of vision or blindness and even a permanently enlarged (dilated) pupil.', 'Glaucoma Diagnosis Higher-than-normal eye pressure doesn’t mean that you have glaucoma. In fact, some people with normal pressure can have it, whereas others with higher levels may not. High pressure without damage to the optic nerve is called ocular hypertension . If you have this, your doctor will want to test your eyes often. Glaucoma tests are painless and don’t take long. They include: Dilated eye exam to widen your pupils and look at the optic nerve at the back of your eyes Gonioscopy to check the angle where your iris and cornea meet Optical coherence tomography (OCT) to look for changes in your optic nerve that may mean glaucoma Ocular pressure test (tonometry) to measure eye pressure Pachymetry to measure corneal thickness Slit-lamp exam to check the inside of your eye with a special microscope called a slit lamp Visual acuity test (eye charts) to check for vision loss Visual field test (perimetry) to check for changes in peripheral vision (your ability to see things off to the side)', 'Glaucoma Treatment Open-angle glaucoma is most often treated with combinations of eyedrops , laser trabeculoplasty, and microsurgery. Doctors tend to start with medications, but early laser surgery or microsurgery could work better for some people. Glaucoma Medications Glaucoma eyedrops. These either lower the creation of fluid in your eye or increase its flow out, lowering eye pressure. Side effects can include allergies, redness, stinging, blurred vision, and irritated eyes. Some glaucoma drugs may affect your heart and lungs. Because of potential drug interactions, be sure to tell your doctor about any other medical problems you have or other medications you take. Also, let them know if it’s hard for you to follow a plan involving two or three eyedrops or if they have side effects. They may be able to change your treatment. Oral medication. Your doctor might also prescribe oral medication for you, such as a beta-blocker or carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. These drugs can improve drainage or slow the creation of fluid in your eye.', ""Glaucoma Surgery Laser surgery. This procedure can slightly increase the flow of fluid from your eye if you have open-angle glaucoma. It can stop fluid blockage if you have angle-closure glaucoma. Procedures include: Trabeculoplasty. This opens the drainage area. Iridotomy. This makes a tiny hole in your iris to let fluid flow more freely. Cyclophotocoagulation. This treats areas of the middle layer of your eye to lower fluid production. Microsurgery. In a procedure called a trabeculectomy , your doctor creates a new channel to drain the fluid and ease eye pressure. This form of surgery may need to be done more than once. Your doctor might implant a tube to help drain fluid. This surgery can lead to temporary or permanent vision loss, as well as bleeding or infection. Minimally invasive glaucoma surgeries. This is a newer less invasive form of surgery, which\xa0usually requires tiny openings and uses devices you can’t see with the naked eye. It's generally faster and safer but won’t lower pressure by quite as much. The procedure can also be done at the same time as other procedures such as cataract surgery ."", 'Acute angle-closure glaucoma is usually treated with a laser procedure. As mentioned earlier, this type of\xa0glaucoma is a medical emergency. Go to the emergency room right away. Damage to the optic nerve may begin within a few hours, and if not treated within 6 to 12 hours, it may bring\xa0very serious, permanent loss of vision or blindness and even a permanently enlarged (dilated) pupil. Infant or congenital glaucoma – meaning you’re born with it – is usually treated with surgery because the cause is a problem with your drainage system. Marijuana and Glaucoma Studies in the 1970s reported that smoking marijuana could lower eye pressure. But it would take far too much to significantly lower eye pressure. It also lowers blood pressure, but that could wipe out any gains from marijuana by limiting the blood flow that your optic nerve needs. Reviews by the National Eye Institute and Institute of Medicine show that there is no scientific evidence that marijuana is more effective than modern medications.', ""Tips for Living With Glaucoma Glaucoma is a lifelong condition and needs continual follow-up with your eye doctor. There are other things you can do to help keep your eyes healthy. Get moving . Regular exercise may help lower eye pressure and keep blood flowing to the nerves in your eye. Some activities can increase pressure, so talk to your doctor about the best exercise program for you. Eat healthy . Enjoy a healthy, well-rounded diet. It won't keep your glaucoma from getting worse, but it's key to keeping your body and eyes healthy. Some studies suggest that food high in antioxidants can help when you have glaucoma. Eat more nutrient-rich foods such as: Dark, leafy greens Fish that's packed with omega-3 fatty acids Take your medicine . Be sure to take your drops or pills exactly as directed. Set a reminder on your phone or watch so that you don't forget. Missing your meds could make your glaucoma worse. Careful with contacts. You should be able to continue wearing contact lenses if you use medicated eyedrops. But you may need to use some drugs when you don’t have lenses in. Also, some older medications can change your vision prescription. And if you need surgery, it may affect your ability to wear contacts."", ""Don't smoke . It's important to keep your body healthy, and nicotine takes a toll.\xa0Smoking also increases\xa0blood pressure and eye\xa0inflammation that can increase your\xa0risk for diabetes and\xa0cataracts. Both are risk factors for glaucoma. If you smoke, ask your doctor for advice on how to quit. Watch your caffeine . Watch how much soda, coffee , and tea you drink. Too much caffeine can increase your eye pressure. One study found that just a cup of coffee could make the pressure in your eye go up a significant amount for up to 90 minutes. Elevate your head. Use a wedge pillow when you sleep. It'll keep your head raised just a little. That should help lower your eye pressure. Drink fluids slowly . Don't cut back on how much you drink, but spread out your beverages through the day. If you drink a lot at once, it can strain your eyes. Don't have more than a quart at one time. Instead, sip small amounts."", ""Protect your eyes. Put on protective glasses when you work in the yard or play contact sports. Wear goggles when you swim. When choosing makeup, use non-allergenic brands and replace items often. Be sure to wear sunglasses outside, especially in summer or around high-glare surfaces such as sand, snow, and water. When you have glaucoma, your eyes can be very sensitive to glare. Don't rub. Glaucoma and the medicine you take might make your eyes feel itchy. But fight the urge. You can scratch them and make things worse. Ask your doctor if you can use drops to treat dryness. Drive safely. Most people with glaucoma can still drive as long as they pass their state’s vision test . Simply put, your ability to drive will depend on how much vision has been lost. Some people with advanced glaucoma can get their license renewed with restrictions. Ask your doctor about whether driving will be a concern for you. Be careful with yoga. You may need to reconsider some yoga positions. Some head-down moves that put your heart above your eye can increase your eye pressure. Research hasn’t shown that it makes glaucoma worse, but it’s not a good idea to do yoga positions that increase eye pressure. You may want to avoid poses such as: Downward-facing dog Standing forward bend Plow Legs up the wall"", ""How Can I Help a Parent With Glaucoma? A glaucoma diagnosis can be scary. Many older people are dealing with several problems that come with age. They often worry that they will become a burden to the family if they lose their vision. So first, reassure your parent that many people keep their vision with proper medication and care. Next, help your loved one establish a routine so they get their eyedrops correctly on schedule. They may have to put them in several times a day. This can be especially difficult for people with arthritis , and it’s not an easy task for anyone to remember. You could offer to help, maybe by stopping by the house or by calling with a reminder. Otherwise, talk with your parent's doctor to make sure a plan is in place. Following a treatment plan is extremely important in glaucoma to prevent permanent vision loss. If your parent needs surgery, do what you can to help them prepare, and arrange transportation to follow-up visits to the doctor."", 'Many services and products can help someone with impaired vision continue to write checks, organize their kitchen, tell time, and even play cards. Contact the Glaucoma Foundation to learn more. Remember, the best help you can offer is your emotional support.', 'Glaucoma Prevention You can’t prevent glaucoma. But if you find it early, you can lower your risk of eye damage. These steps may help protect your vision: Get regular eye exams. The sooner your doctor spots the signs of glaucoma, the sooner you can start treatment. All adults need to be checked for glaucoma every 3 to 5 years. If you’re older than 40 and have a family history of the disease, get a complete\xa0eye exam from an eye doctor every 1 to 2 years. If you have health problems such as diabetes or are at risk for other\xa0eye diseases, you may need to go more often. Learn your family history. Ask your relatives whether any of them have been diagnosed with glaucoma.', 'Follow your doctor’s instructions. If they find that you have high eye pressure, they might give you drops to prevent glaucoma. Exercise. Do moderate activity such as walking or jogging at least three times a week. Protect your eyes. Use protective eyewear when playing sports or working on home improvement projects.', ""When to Call the Doctor It's time to call the doctor if your eye is painful and red. It can be a sign of: Acute narrow-angle glaucoma Inflammation Infection Other serious eye conditions. To prevent permanent eye damage or blindness, you may need medical attention right away. You should also call them if you get drowsy,\xa0tired, or short of breath after using eyedrops to treat glaucoma. It could mean the drug is making a\xa0heart or lung problem worse. Tell your doctor what\xa0medications you’re taking. Certain drugs, even over-the-counter medications – especially those used to treat\xa0sinus and\xa0cold congestion and\xa0stomach and gut disorders – may trigger an acute closed-angle glaucoma attack. Bring a list of all your medications with you to the eye doctor."", ""Takeaways If you're at high risk for glaucoma, make sure you schedule a comprehensive dilated eye exam every 2 years. Early detection is critical to saving your sight if you do get glaucoma. If you have sudden eye pain, among other symptoms, it may be the acute closed- or narrow-angle forms of glaucoma. Go to your nearest emergency room right away. Both can quickly lead to blindness if left untreated."", 'FAQs 1.What is the main cause of glaucoma? The fluid inside your eye, called aqueous humor, usually flows out of your eye through a mesh-like channel. If this channel gets blocked or the eye is producing too much fluid, the liquid builds up. Sometimes, experts don’t know what causes this blockage, but it can be inherited, meaning it’s passed from parents to children. 2. What are the first signs that glaucoma is developing? Most people with open-angle glaucoma don’t have symptoms. If symptoms do show up, they usually come late in the disease. That’s why glaucoma is often called the ""sneak thief of vision."" The main sign is usually loss of side, or peripheral, vision. Symptoms of angle-closure glaucoma usually come on faster and are more obvious. Damage can occur quickly. If you have any of these symptoms, get medical care right away', '3. What are the major signs of glaucoma? Except for acute closed- or narrow-angle glaucoma, most cases of glaucoma cannot be felt, especially in the early stages.\xa0Acute closed- or narrow-angle glaucoma symptoms strike quickly. People often describe it as “the worst\xa0eye pain of my life.” Symptoms include: Severe throbbing eye pain Eye redness Headaches (on the same side as the affected\xa0eye) Blurry or foggy\xa0vision Halos around lights Dilated pupil Nausea and vomiting']"
39,Lynch Syndrome: Get the Facts,"[""What Is Lynch Syndrome? Lynch syndrome is a condition that makes people more likely to get certain cancers. It's passed down from parents to children through problem genes. People who have it have about a 40% to 80% chance of getting colorectal cancer by age 70. They’re also at risk for cancer of the uterus, ovaries, or stomach . And they tend to get cancer at younger ages than other people, often in their 30s and 40s. Lynch syndrome is sometimes called hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC). Other forms of the condition are Muir-Torre syndrome and Turcot syndrome, both of which raise your risk of other cancers and, in the case of Muir-Torre, skin lesions."", ""What Causes It? Lynch syndrome is caused by a problem in one of five genes in your DNA. These are the genes that affect how well your cells can spot mistakes and fix them as they grow and multiply. When you have Lynch syndrome, your cells don't fix the errors. They make more and more flawed cells. Over time, that can cause cancer. If one of your parents has it, you have a 50% chance of getting it, too."", ""Signs of Lynch Syndrome If you get colon cancer before age 50, that's a possible sign. Other things that may suggest a risk of Lynch syndrome include: Other people in your family had colon cancer when they were young. Women in your family have had endometrial or uterine cancer . Members of your family have had cancer of the kidney , liver , small intestine, stomach , or sebaceous (oil-producing)\xa0glands."", ""Other Cancer Risks Lynch syndrome is the most common reason why some women get cancer of the uterus. It also can raise your risk of these types of cancer: Brain Gallbladder ducts Liver Ovaries Pancreas Skin Small intestine Stomach Sebaceous\xa0gland Upper urinary tract If you have Lynch syndrome, you're also more likely to get noncancerous growths called polyps inside your colon . Polyps are common in older people, but people with Lynch syndrome may get them earlier in life."", ""How Is It Diagnosed? If you or someone in your family gets cancer, the doctor can do one of these tests on a small sample of the tumor to look for signs of Lynch syndrome: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) tests use dye to mark proteins in the tumor sample. If certain proteins aren't there, it's a sign of Lynch syndrome. Microsatellite instability (MSI) tests look at the DNA in the tumor tissue. They can show errors in your genes that point to Lynch syndrome."", ""Tumors that were taken out in the previous few years can sometimes be tested. Some hospitals store tumor samples after surgery in case they need to be tested later. If someone in your family is diagnosed with Lynch syndrome, or if you think you’re at risk of getting it, you may want to get a gene test, which is done with a sample of your blood . Your doctor can also refer you to a genetic counselor to discuss your risks and options. Your counselor can help you understand: How Lynch syndrome is passed through families What gene changes your test results may show What these results mean for your cancer risk The chances that you may pass the gene to your children Your options to prevent cancer A positive test for Lynch syndrome doesn't always mean you'll get cancer. Your risk is just much higher. A genetic counselor will work with you to decide what to do next. They can give you information about your options and emotional support."", 'What Are the Treatment Options? If you have Lynch syndrome, be sure to get regular screenings in order to find any cancers at their earliest stages, when they’re easiest to treat. Colon cancer is 90% curable when you catch it early. If you’re at risk, you should start getting checkups much earlier than usual. Your screening schedule will depend on your family history and whether you’ve had DNA testing . Here are some general guidelines: Colonoscopies every 1 to 2 years, beginning at age 20 to 25. This test uses a long scope to look for polyps in your colon. People with Lynch syndrome often get polyps that are harder to see. So you may need to have a high-definition colonoscopy or a chromoendoscopy, which uses dyes to color the polyps. A colonoscopy may show polyps before they become cancer. Endoscopies every 3 to 5 years, starting in your early to mid-30s. Both men and women can get an endoscopy to look in their stomach or intestines for signs of cancer. Pelvic exams, uterine biopsies , or transvaginal ultrasounds to check your uterus and ovaries once a year starting around age 30. Your doctor may also recommend blood tests to check how well your liver is working. Some people with Lynch syndrome choose to have their colon taken out to help prevent cancer later on. Women who don’t want children in the future may also have their uterus and ovaries removed.', 'Tips for Living With Lynch Syndrome Aside from cancer screenings , a healthy lifestyle may help you prevent colorectal cancer. Diets high in veggies, fruit, and whole grains can help lower your risk. So can regular exercise , keeping a healthy weight , and limiting alcohol . There is some evidence that taking aspirin every day for at least 2 years may decrease the risk of Lynch-related cancer, but more research is needed to find the best dose and length of time for treatment.']"

42,Arthritis Supplements,"['Many people with arthritis -- especially osteoarthritis -- use supplements in their diet to ease the pain of arthritis . Glucosamine and chondroitin are the most well-known. Methyl sulfonylmethane (MSM) is another supplement used to ease the pain of arthritis, but it has not been through as much scientific testing. It is important to check with your doctor before starting any new treatments. Your doctor can review the other medications you are taking and help you decide whether or not these arthritis supplements are right for you. In addition, always follow the instructions on the medication label. Do not take more of the supplements than is recommended.', 'What Are Glucosamine and Chondroitin? Glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate are components of normal cartilage. In the body, they are the building blocks for cartilage and appear to stimulate the body to make more cartilage. There are conflicting studies on glucosamine and chondroitin, some demonstrating a beneficial effect on osteoarthritis pain. Others, including the NIH-sponsored multicenter Glucosamine/Chondroitin Arthritis Intervention Trial (GAIT), did not show benefit for the primary outcome of reducing pain. More recently another study also found that glucosamine did not slow down cartilage damage or reduce knee pain.', 'The supplements, which are available in pharmacies and health food stores without a prescription, are well-tolerated and appear to be safe. However, there are no long-term studies to confirm their long-term safety and effectiveness. Keep in mind that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates supplements, but treats them like food rather than drugs; supplement manufacturers are not required to prove their products are safe or effective before selling them in the marketplace . Many physicians may still recommend a trial of glucosamine at this point, and if there is not apparent improvement by three months, it would be reasonable to stop glucosamine. Research is ongoing.', ""Which Brand of Arthritis Supplement Should I Use? There are many different brands of glucosamine and chondroitin, which are usually sold together as one arthritis supplement. Again, there is no government monitoring to ensure the purity of these products. In order to assure that you get a consistent dose of the supplements, stick with a reputable manufacturer; choose products sold by large and well-established companies. If you don't recognize a brand name, ask about the company's reputation, how long it has been in business, and how long the store has stocked the brand."", 'Who Should Not Take These Arthritis Supplements? People with diabetes should use caution when taking glucosamine because it may raise blood sugar. People taking blood -thinning medication (anticoagulants) should check with their doctors before taking glucosamine and chondroitin. These arthritis supplements may also have a blood -thinning effect, so people taking these supplements in addition to an anticoagulant may have to have their blood tested more often. People who are allergic to shellfish also should consult their doctors before using glucosamine and chondroitin. Glucosamine is extracted from a substance in shellfish. The effects of these supplements on a growing child or developing baby are not yet known. For that reason, glucosamine and chondroitin are not recommended for children, women who are pregnant, women who are nursing, and women who could become pregnant.', 'What Are the Side Effects of Glucosamine and Chondroitin? These arthritis supplements are generally well-tolerated. However, side effects can occur. The most commonly reported side effects of glucosamine and chondroitin include: Nausea Diarrhea or constipation Heartburn Increased intestinal gas', 'What Is MSM and Can It Help My Arthritis? MSM, or methylsulfonylmethane, is a supplement that is used to try to help a wide range of conditions, including arthritis, allergies, and even snoring . MSM is an odorless and tasteless natural sulfur compound found in all living things. Sulfur is needed by the body for healthy connective tissue and joint function and has purported pain-quashing and anti-inflammatory properties. While MSM is found in many foods -- including meat, fish, certain fruit, vegetables, and grains -- it is destroyed when foods are processed. MSM supplements have become increasingly popular in recent years and many people feel they have had some pain relief since taking MSM. Although some studies have reported improvement in pain with MSM, more research needs to be done to support its use as an arthritis supplement. Those patients with multiple health conditions should be aware that current prescription medication may interact with dietary supplements , and they should consult their doctor so that side effects can be best monitored. Moreover, as with many supplements that have not been studied, the long-term benefits and safety of the chemical are unknown. Talk to your doctor before taking MSM.', 'What Are the Side Effects of MSM? MSM is considered very safe, and side effects are rare.

You may then have tests to find out what caused it and how it affects you. They include: An ultrasound to see how large your thyroid is and whether you have nodules Blood tests to measure your thyroid hormone levels and see whether you have the antibodies that some goiters cause. Antibodies are proteins your body makes to fight infection. A biopsy , where your doctor uses a thin needle to take a sample of tissue or fluid for testing. This is used to rule out cancer. A thyroid scan , in which your doctor injects a little radioactive material to create an image of your thyroid on a computer screen. This shows your doctor the size of your thyroid and how well it's working. A CT scan or MRI if your goiter is large or has spread to your chest"", 'Goiter Treatment A goiter may not need treatment, especially if it is small and thyroid hormone levels are normal. But if your thyroid hormone levels are too high or too low, you will need treatment.', ""Treatment involves getting the thyroid hormone levels back to normal. Depending on what caused your goiter and how serious it is, your doctor can treat it with: Medication. If you have hypothyroidism, your doctor may prescribe a thyroid hormone replacement medication. When the medication takes effect, the thyroid may begin to return to its normal size. But a large nodular goiter with a lot of internal scar tissue will not shrink with treatment. For goiters caused by inflammation , you might take aspirin or corticosteroids. Surgery. If the goiter is uncomfortable, causes overproduction of thyroid hormone unresponsive to medications , is large enough that it causes symptoms because of its size, or becomes cancerous, the entire thyroid gland may have to be surgically removed. Or they might take out only part of it. Afterward, you may need to take thyroid hormone medicine for the rest of your life. Radioactive iodine. You take this in a pill to treat an overactive thyroid. It kills cells to shrink the thyroid. After this treatment, you'll probably need to take hormone drugs from then on. If you have a goiter, your doctor may want to check it on a periodic basis with ultrasound to be sure that it isn’t growing larger or developing suspicious looking nodules that might call for a fine-needle biopsy."", 'Call Your Doctor About a Goiter If: You should call the doctor if you experience any of the above symptoms with a goiter because you may have hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism that needs treatment. Goiters are slow-growing, but if you have a large goiter and notice shortness of breath or voice changes, you should call the doctor. The goiter may be pressing on your jugular vein, windpipe, esophagus , or the nerve that runs to your larynx. The growth requires treatment and may need to be surgically removed.']"

45,What Is Graft Versus Host Disease?,"['Graft versus host disease, or GVHD, is a complication of a stem cell transplant, a treatment for blood cancers and certain blood or immune system disorders. With GVHD, white blood cells called T cells from the donor -- the graft, or the “G” in GVHD -- attack cells within the recipient’s, or host’s, body. GVHD is possible after an allogeneic transplant -- that’s when the donor cells come from anyone other than an identical twin. Up to two-thirds of all people who have an allogenic transplant will at some point have symptoms of GVHD. GVHD is a sign that those T cells are fighting any remaining cancer cells in your body (the graft versus tumor effect). In fact, people who get GVHD have a lower rate of cancer relapse. Although it can be mild or moderate, it can also be severe or even life-threatening. There are two main types of GVHD: Acute GVHD usually involves the skin, the GI tract, and sometimes the liver. It used to be defined by when it started, which is often between 14 and 100 days after the transplant. But more recently its signs, rather than its timing, are used to make a diagnosis. Also, it can start after the 100-day mark in what’s called late-onset acute GVHD.', 'Chronic GVHD often involves the skin, GI tract, and liver to a higher degree than acute GVHD. It also affects more parts of the body. For about 40% of people with severe GVHD, that’s four or more organs. It also has some of the signs of an autoimmune disease, like inflammation. Chronic GVHD is slightly more common than the acute form. It tends to start after the 100-day mark but may not come until years later. It can happen on its own or after acute GVHD. It’s possible for the two forms to overlap (overlap syndrome).', 'Causes There have been many advances in tissue typing to match people to the best donors, but sometimes there’s a mismatch between the host and the donor that involves the human leukocyte antigen (HLA). This is a molecule on the surface of nearly every cell in the body. That can lead to GVHD.', 'GVHD is also more likely if you or the donor is older or if the donor is a woman who’s been pregnant. These are things to consider if your best donor is a sibling, especially a sister.', 'On the other hand, umbilical cord blood is less likely to cause GVHD. There are many steps your medical team will take to help prevent GVHD. These include medications that temporarily turn off your immune system. This may stop donor cells from attacking your body. New combinations of these drugs are becoming more and more effective. Since pausing your immune system leaves you vulnerable to different types of infections, you’ll also take medications to prevent them. Other triggers can cause GVHD. One is when you start to cut back on drugs that suppress your immune system. Another is sun exposure, so you want to avoid it until your doctor gives you the all-clear.', 'Symptoms Each organ that acute GVHD affects shows its own signs: Your skin. The very first symptom is often a sunburn-like rash on the ears, the back of the neck, the shoulders, palms, and soles. It can be itchy or painful and may spread across your entire body. Sometimes, blister-like lesions develop. Your GI tract. Your entire digestive system can be affected. You may have intense diarrhea and cramps, feel nauseated, vomit, and have no appetite. Your liver. A blood test will show early warning signs like high levels of bilirubin and liver enzymes. A more obvious sign is jaundice, which is when the whites of your eyes turn yellow. The symptoms of chronic GVHD are often more intense than those of acute GVHD. Also, because the chronic form attacks other parts of your body, you may have other symptoms: Thickened skin (sclerosis), with severe dryness that extends to the skin of your genitals and to your nails Swollen belly and weight loss from not being able to eat High levels of cholesterol and other blood fats are more signs that your liver isn’t working as well as it should Dry mouth, sensitivity to certain foods, and possibly gum disease Very gritty dry eyes or changes to your vision Dry cough and shortness of breath Muscle pain or weakness, and a loss of range of motion Painful sex due to changes within the genitals, if you have a vagina', 'Getting a Diagnosis Your doctor may be able to diagnose GVHD from your symptoms alone. It’s also possible to make a chronic GVHD diagnosis from telltale signs during an exam. Sometimes, skin lesions, mouth sores, dry eyes, or genital changes might look like chronic GVHD, but you’ll need tests to confirm it. Chronic GVHD may be mild, moderate, or severe, based on how many organs are involved and how seriously. One national study found that 53% of people get moderate GVHD, 19% mild, and 28% severe.', 'Questions for Your Doctor GVHD is a complicated condition. Arm yourself with as much information as you can. To start, ask your doctor for answers to these questions: Do I need a team of specialists to monitor the different organs involved? How often do I need follow-up visits? How long does the type of GVHD I have tend to last? Am I a candidate for a clinical trial for cutting-edge medication? What new or worsening symptoms should I report to you? What can I do on my own to improve my quality of life?', 'Treatment Treatment is tailored to your symptoms and how severe they are. It may take a team of experts. If your GVHD is mild, your doctor may just keep an eye on you. If only your skin is involved, they might have you apply a steroid ointment. If you have chronic GVHD of your eyes, you may use special eyedrops. If you have more severe or widespread symptoms, you’ll likely need medication to calm your immune system and ease inflammation. There are many classes of drugs that your team can prescribe. Immunosuppressants are medications that neutralize your immune system. Drugs from this group are typically the first-line GVHD treatment: Corticosteroids are usually the first of these drugs given. For acute GVHD, your doctor may put you on methylprednisolone through an IV for 2 weeks. For chronic GVHD, you might take prednisone in pill form for weeks or months. The goal is to taper off these drugs as soon as possible.', 'You may take other immunosuppressants, often at the same time. Taking one of these along with a corticosteroid may improve results: Cyclosporine ( Gengraf , Neoral , Sandimmune ) Sirolimus ( Rapamune ) Tacrolimus ( Astagraf XL , Envarsus XR , Prograf ) Other drugs in this class are: Azathioprine ( Azasan , Imuran ) Mycophenolate mofetil ( CellCept , Myfortic ) When steroids or other immune-suppressing drugs don’t work well enough, your doctor might prescribe other medications from different drug classes: Immunomodulating agents suppress an inflammatory protein called tumor necrosis factor-α, or TNF-a: Thalidomide ( Thalomid ) Photoactive agents are drugs activated by light and may help treat skin lesions: Methoxsalen ( Oxsoralen-Ultra ) Antineoplastic agents inhibit dangerous cells from growing and multiplying: Ibrutinib ( Imbruvica ). This is a recently approved drug for chronic GVHD in adults, targeting a different enzyme called a tyrosine kinase, which can also play a role in cancer. Methotrexate ( Trexall ) Pentostatin ( Nipent ) Ruxolitinib ( Jakafi ). This is a recently approved drug for acute GVHD\xa0for ages 12 and over. It targets\xa0enzymes called JAKs (Janus-associated kinases) that play a role in developing cancer.', 'Monoclonal antibodies are biologic, or manmade, drugs that target specific cells involved in GVHD, including TNF. But their effects may make your immune system even more vulnerable. More research is needed to find out how effective they are: Alemtuzumab ( Lemtrada ) Etanercept ( Enbrel ). This drug helps enhance steroids in some patients. Infliximab ( Remicade ) Rituximab ( Rituxan ) Extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) is a complex treatment that involves removing certain white blood cells from your blood. The cells are treated with a special drug and UVA light, and then they’re put back into your body to fight off abnormal blood cells. Your doctor may suggest it if other drugs fail to work or stop working. When steroids don’t work well enough, your doctor might prescribe one of the newer drugs approved for GVHD: Ibrutinib ( Imbruvica ) for chronic GVHD in adults Ruxolitinib ( Jakafi ) for acute GVHD\xa0for ages 12 and over A possible breakthrough drug that targets the immune system, as well as GVHD symptoms like skin sclerosis and tissue changes in eyes, lungs, and joints, is belumosudil . It stops a process in the body called ROCK2 that enables GVHD. In clinical trials, belumosudil helped a high percentage of people with hard-to-treat GVHD.', 'Your treatment plan might include other drugs targeted to specific problems. Supportive therapies may also be important -- they help you overcome or even prevent other problems. For instance, you may need a feeding tube if GI issues put you at risk for malnutrition or bone-strengthening drugs to guard against the bone loss linked to steroids.', 'Taking Care of Yourself There’s a lot you can do to boost your physical health: Take steps to avoid infections -- wash your hands often, and avoid any visits from loved ones who are sick. Pamper your skin. Use rich creams -- with your doctor’s OK -- to ease dryness. Wash with the gentlest cleansers, and avoid hot water. Talk to your doctor if diarrhea has left the skin around your anus irritated. Protect your eyes. Wear UV-coated sunglasses when outdoors. Get more frequent care from your eye doctor. Remember oral hygiene. Dry mouth makes you more prone to cavities and gum disease. Besides brushing and flossing, you may need to see your dentist every 3 months rather than every 6. Upgrade your diet. Work with your medical team or a dietitian to make sure you’re getting the nutrients and fluids you need, especially if you have nausea or diarrhea. Try to exercise. Even gentle movement can help bone health and muscle strength. Work with a physical therapist if you’re not sure how to restart a fitness plan or if you have trouble getting around. Exercise will improve sleep quality, too. It’s also important to protect your mental and emotional well-being: Try meditation or other relaxation techniques to keep a positive outlook. Get back to activities that make you happy. This might be as simple as listening to your favorite music, watching a movie, or revisiting a hobby.', 'What to Expect It can be hard to live with GVHD, especially since treatment can take months or years. Besides any physical symptoms. Depression and anxiety are common. These emotional side effects often go away when GVHD gets better. But you don’t have to let them take over your life even temporarily. Find ways to express your feelings rather than keeping them bottled inside. Get outside help if you need it. Consider therapy from a social worker, psychologist, or psychiatrist. The nonprofit group Be The Match offers free counseling services. Check out its website at bethematch.org for more.', 'Getting Support A strong support system will help you manage your physical and emotional symptoms. Your network starts with close family and friends and extends to your care team. For insights from people who have gone through GVHD, expand that network with a support group. You and the group members can help each other see that you’re not alone in this journey.']"
46,Rashes,"['What Are Rashes? Rashes are unusual changes in skin color or texture. They normally come from skin inflammation , which can have different causes. There are many types of rashes, including those caused by skin conditions like eczema, granuloma annulare , lichen planus , and pityriasis rosea . Eczema is a general term that describes several different conditions in which skin is inflamed, red, scaly, and itchy. Atopic dermatitis, which can cause an itchy rash, is one of the most common forms of eczema. (Photo credit: Moment/Getty Images)', 'Symptoms of Rashes The symptoms that come along with a skin rash depend on the cause and type of rash. Some common symptoms include: Blistering Redness Scaly or dry skin Similarity to hives Blotchiness Swelling or inflammation Itchy skin Pain Infection of the areas of broken skin Shiny, flat-topped bumps Large affected areas of skin Circular-shaped affected areas', 'Causes of Rashes Irritants and allergens in the climate/environment can cause rashes on the skin. Other common causes include: Viral or bacterial infections Skin conditions such as rosacea or eczema Stress Skin irritants (including soaps, skin care products , or some fabrics) Personal and/or family history of allergies, hay fever, or asthma Allergic to certain medications, including those that treat high blood pressure, heart disease, and arthritis Triggering agents from other conditions, such as hepatitis B or hepatitis C Some causes and triggers for rashes are unknown.', 'Common Skin Rash Types Some common skin rash types include those caused by skin conditions like eczema, granuloma annulare, lichen planus, and pityriasis rosea. Eczema Eczema is a general term that describes several different conditions in which skin is inflamed, red, scaly, and itchy. Eczema is a common skin condition, and atopic dermatitis (also called atopic eczema) is one of the most common forms of eczema . It can affect adults or children and isn’t contagious. The way eczema looks can vary from person to person. In adults, eczema most often affects the hands, elbows, and back of your knees. In young children, eczema often also shows up on the face, back of the neck, and scalp. Some things can trigger a flare-up of eczema or make eczema worse, but they don’t cause the condition. Hives Hives is a skin condition that causes raised, itchy bumps or welts. If you have hives, you could be allergic to something airborne or an insect bite. It can also be caused by changes in the temperature and bacterial infections.', ""Contact dermatitis The type of rash that comes from contact dermatitis happens when your body reacts to irritants such as detergents, fragrances, and chemicals. It can cause inflammation, itchiness, and redness. Granuloma annulare Granuloma annulare is a chronic skin condition. A circular-shaped rash with reddish bumps (papules) is a common symptom. Most often, it affects children and young adults. It's slightly more common in girls and is usually seen in people who are otherwise healthy. If you have granuloma annulare, you'll usually notice one or more rings of small, firm bumps over the back of your forearms, hands, or feet . The rash may be mildly itchy. Lichen planus Lichen planus is a common skin condition that causes shiny, flat-topped bumps. They often have an angular shape and a reddish-purplish color. Li chen planus can show up anywhere on the skin but often affects the insides of your wrists and ankles , lower legs, back, and neck. Some people have lichen planus inside their mouth , genital region, scalp, and nails. Thick collections of bumps may occur, especially on the shins."", 'Lichen planus most often affects adults ages 30-70 years. It isn’t common in very young or elderly people. Pityriasis rosea Pityriasis rosea is a common skin rash that is usually mild. The condition often begins with a large, scaly, pink patch of skin on your chest or back. Next, you’ll notice one patch of pink skin quickly followed by more. Your skin will be itchy and red or inflamed. The number and sizes of spots can vary. Pityriasis rosea affects the back, neck, chest, abdomen , upper arms, and legs. The rash can differ from person to person. Viral conditions. Rashes on the skin can be the result of a viral infection such as measles or chickenpox. Psoriasis. This skin condition causes a rash is thick and scaly and usually appears on the knees, back, elbows, genitals, and scalp. It is permanent and can be passed down from your parents.', 'Diagnosing Rashes Diagnosing a skin rash can be hard because the symptoms can be caused by many things. Your doctor will check your skin and ask about your symptoms and may decide to diagnose your rash using tests such as: Skin biopsy. This involves taking a small bit of skin from the affected area and sending it to a lab for testing for a virus or bacteria. (see symptoms and diagnosis of eczema ) Blood test. Your doctor can diagnose certain diseases by looking at antibodies in your blood. Also, rashes can be the result of systemic conditions, and blood tests can help to check how your organs may be affected. Allergy test. These tests include skin pricks or patch tests to look for allergens. During the test, your skin is exposed to certain allergens to detect any potential reactions.', 'Treatment for Rashes The treatment your doctor recommends will depend on the cause of your skin rash. Some treatment options include: Over-the-counter and prescription creams and ointments. You can treat rashes caused by skin conditions like eczema with moisturizers that are fragrance-free and contain ingredients such as ceramides, glycerin , and mineral oil . Medications include over-the-counter creams and ointments containing the steroid hydrocortisone (for example, Cortizone -10, Cort-Aid, Dermarest Eczema, Neosporin Eczema). These products may help control the itching, swelling, and redness linked to eczema.', ""In more severe cases, prescription-strength cortisone creams are also used. Steroids. If you have ongoing symptoms, your doctor may prescribe topical or oral steroid treatment, which can help with itchy and inflamed skin. Topical immunomodulators. For people with mild-to-moderate eczema, topical immunomodulators can help. These medications, including brand name products Elidel and Protopic , work by changing the body's immune response to allergens, thereby preventing flare-ups. Shots (injections). Injections can be used to treat rashes that come from certain skin conditions. Dupilumab ( Dupixent ), for example, is an injectable monoclonal antibody used in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. It clears the itch quickly in most patients. Cortisone shots can also be used in more severe cases. Phototherapy (light therapy). This is another treatment that helps some people with eczema. Phototherapy uses ultraviolet light, either ultraviolet A (UVA) or ultraviolet B (UVB), from special lamps to treat people with severe cases. Risks linked to phototherapy include burning (usually resembling a mild sunburn ), dry skin , itchy skin, freckling, and potential premature aging of the skin. Your health care professionals will work with you to lessen any risks. Anti-itch products or allergy medications such as antihistamines . Antihistamines, such as Diphenhydramine or Benadryl , can help soothe the itchiness. Immunosuppressive medications. Medications including steroid shots, prednisone, or other drugs can help clear up a rash by suppressing your immune system."", ""Complications of Rashes Rashes on the skin aren't usually problematic and respond well to treatment. Some possible complications include: Infection. When you scratch an itchy rash, it opens your skin. This allows pathogens such as bacteria to enter, putting you at risk of infection. Anaphylaxis. In addition to a skin rash, some people can have a severe allergic reaction that is life-threatening, also known as anaphylaxis. The extreme swelling that happens in anaphylaxis can close your air passages. An immediate injection with epinephrine (EpiPen) is needed to act against the allergic reaction. If you have an itchy feeling in your mouth or throat with your skin rash, talk to your doctor about the need for an EpiPen."", ""How to Prevent Rashes There are ways to lessen your risk and prevent flare-ups such as those associated with atopic eczema : Reduce stress . Avoid scratchy materials (for example, wool) and chemicals that can be triggers, such as harsh soaps, detergents, and solvents. Moisturize often. Avoid sudden changes in temperature or humidity. Avoid situations that cause sweating and overheating. Immediately wash your hands when you come into contact with something you're allergic to.""]"
47,What Is Mycosis Fungoides?,"[""Sometimes a red rash is more than an annoying skin problem. It can be a sign of illness, including a blood cancer with a big name: mycosis fungoides. This condition, also known as Alibert-Bazin syndrome or cutaneous T-cell lymphoma,\xa0is rare. It happens when white blood cells called T-cells grow out of control and move from the blood into the skin . This causes the rash, which can be itchy. When cancerous T-cells are found in your blood as well as in your skin, it's called Sézary syndrome. Sézary syndrome (SS) and mycosis fungoides (MF) are the most common subtypes of cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL) Doctors don't know what causes mycosis fungoides. It could be related to a virus, exposure to a chemical, or your genes. It can happen at any age, but most people get it in their 50s or 60s. Men are two times more likely than women to have it."", ""Symptoms Mycosis fungoides usually develops slowly and moves through four phases. But not everyone goes through all of them: First phase: A\xa0scaly red rash , usually in areas that don't get sunlight, such as your rear end; there are no other symptoms in this phase, and it may last months or even years. Second phase: A\xa0thin red rash that looks like patches Third phase: Small raised bumps or hard plaques that may be red Fourth phase: Tumors or bumps that may look like mushrooms; they can break open and get infected. You can have patches, plaques, and tumors at the same time. But most people who've had mycosis fungoides for many years only have the first two."", ""Does It Spread? It usually doesn't go beyond the skin. Many people live a normal life while treating the rash. However, in 10% of people, the cancer spreads to lymph nodes or other organs, which can be serious. Some people also develop Sézary syndrome. The cancerous cells are found in your blood, and almost all your skin is affected. It may look like you have sunburn , and your skin may itch like crazy. Sézary syndrome grows and spreads fast and is more difficult to treat than mycosis fungoides."", ""Diagnosis It can be hard for your doctor to know for sure that you have mycosis fungoides. The patches or plaques can look like eczema, psoriasis, or another common skin problem . It's possible to have it for years before you get the right diagnosis. Your doctor will take a small sample of your skin -- a biopsy -- and put it under a microscope to look for signs of the cancer . You might need several biopsies to confirm it."", ""Treatment Mycosis fungoides is rarely cured, but some people stay in remission for a long time. In early stages, it's often treated with medicines or therapies that target just your skin. Your doctor may use more than one approach: Creams, gels, or lotions: These include corticosteroids, vitamin A medicines called retinoids, and chemotherapy drugs that are spread on the skin. They can clear the rash, control the cancer, and get rid of the itch. Phototherapy: This uses ultraviolet light rays to heal the skin. Sometimes, you take a drug beforehand that makes T-cells more sensitive to the light. Radiation : Electron beam radiation works well against mycosis fungoides. It uses very tiny electrically charged particles (electrons) to target and kill cancer cells. This type of radiation only enters the upper layers of your skin, so deeper tissues and organs are safe. It's given in two ways: Total skin radiation: Your whole body may need it if you have mycosis fungoides spots in lots of places. Spot treatment: If you only have a few trouble spots, radiation can target just those areas. This is often used when other therapies haven't worked."", ""If your cancer is more advanced, your doctor may suggest whole body therapies. These include: Chemotherapy : Strong drugs target cancer and other cells that divide quickly. Targeted and biologic therapy: Some drugs identify and attack specific parts of cancer cells. Others boost your immune system to fight them. Retinoid pills: These change the way cancer cells grow and mature. Photopheresis: This therapy uses ultraviolet light to treat cancerous cells in your blood. It's like giving blood, but instead of it going into a collection bag, blood goes into a special machine that takes out T-cells. They're treated with a drug and then exposed to the UV rays. The cells are mixed back in with the rest of your blood and returned to your body. This usually is used to treat advanced cases of mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome. Doctors think it works by killing some cancer cells and by boosting your body's immune attack against other ones."", ""Living With Mycosis Fungoides This cancer can make your skin very dry and itchy. Here are a few things you can do: Take short, lukewarm baths or showers. Long, hot ones can make dryness and itchiness worse. Pat your skin dry -- don't rub it. Use an unscented skin moisturizer after bathing so moisture gets locked in. Put a cold compress on areas that are really itchy.

48,Graves' Disease,"[""What Is Graves' Disease? Graves’ disease is an autoimmune condition that causes your thyroid to become hyperactive -- work harder than it needs to. It is one of the most common thyroid problems and the leading cause of hyperthyroidism , a condition in which the thyroid gland produces too many hormones. It was named after the man who first described it in the early 19th century, Sir Robert Graves. The thyroid gland is a small butterfly-shaped gland that sits in the front of your neck and releases hormones that help regulate your metabolism. When you have Graves’ disease, your immune system attacks your thyroid, causing it to overproduce those hormones, which causes a number of problems in different parts of your body. It usually affects people between the ages of 30 and 50 and is more common in women. Once the disorder has been correctly diagnosed, it is quite easy to treat. In some cases, Graves' disease goes into remission or disappears completely after several months or years. Left untreated, however, it can lead to serious complications -- even death."", ""Causes of Graves' Disease Graves’ disease. Graves’ disease is an autoimmune disease in which your thyroid works harder than it needs to (hyperthyroidism). Some patients develop thyroid eye disease in which their eye muscles and tissues swell, causing the eyes to protrude from their sockets (exophthalmos). Hormones secreted by the thyroid gland control metabolism , or the speed at which the body converts food into energy. Metabolism is directly linked to the amount of hormones that circulate in the bloodstream. If, for some reason, the thyroid gland secretes too much of these hormones, the body's metabolism kicks into high gear, causing a pounding heart , sweating, trembling, and weight loss. Normally, the thyroid gets its production orders through another chemical called thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), released by the pituitary gland in the brain . But in Graves' disease, a malfunction in the body's immune system releases abnormal antibodies that act like TSH. Spurred by these false signals to produce, the thyroid's hormone factories work overtime and overproduce. Exactly why the immune system begins to produce these troublesome antibodies isn’t clear. Heredity and other characteristics seem to play a role. Studies show, for example, that if one identical twin contracts Graves' disease, there is a 20% likelihood that the other twin will get it too. Also, women are more likely than men to develop the disease. And smokers who develop Graves' disease are more prone to eye problems than nonsmokers with the disease. No single gene causes Graves’ disease. It is thought to be triggered by both genetics and environmental factors."", 'Symptoms of Graves’ Disease The most common symptoms of Graves’ are symptoms of hyperthyroidism, which include: Nervousness, anxiety or irritability Tired or weak muscles Shaking in your hands Frequent bowel movements or diarrhea Difficulty sleeping Greater sensitivity to heat or increase sweating Unintentional weight loss An enlarged thyroid (also called a goiter ) A fast or irregular heartbeat Changes in your period for women Erectile dysfunction in men Loss of sex drive (low libido)', ""Complications of Graves’ Disease Eye complications A small percentage of all Graves' patients will develop a condition called thyroid eye disease in which your eye muscles and tissues become swollen. This can cause exophthalmos -- your eyeballs protrude from their sockets -- and is considered a hallmark of Graves' disease, even though it’s rare. But having this complication doesn’t have anything to do with how severe your Graves’ disease is. In fact, it isn't clear whether such eye complications stem from Graves' disease itself or from a totally separate, but closely linked, disorder. If you have developed thyroid eye diease, your eyes may ache and feel dry and irritated. Protruding eyeballs are prone to excessive tearing and redness, partly because the eyelids can’t protect them as well."", ""In severe cases of exophthalmos, which are rare, swollen eye muscles can put tremendous pressure on the optic nerve, possibly leading to partial blindness. Eye muscles weakened by long periods of inflammation can lose their ability to control movement, resulting in double vision . Skin complications Some people with Graves’ may develop a rare skin condition known as pretibial myxedema or Graves’ dermopathy. It is a lumpy reddish thickening of the skin on the shins. It is usually painless and is not serious. Like exophthalmos this condition does not necessarily begin with the onset of Graves' and doesn’t have to do with how severe your disease is."", 'Graves’ Disease Diagnosis If you have symptoms or signs of the complications of Graves’ disease, your doctor will probably ask you if you have a family history of the condition and order one or more of the following tests: A blood test to check your levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and other thyroid hormones. With Graves’ disease your TSH levels are usually suppressed and your other hormones are elevated. Lab tests to look for the antibodies that cause Graves’s disease. If you don’t have them, that’s a sign that your hyperthyroidism is caused by something else. A radioactive iodine uptake test that uses small doses of radioactive iodine to watch how much of it is taken up into your thyroid from your bloodstream. Your body normally uses iodine to make thyroid hormones, so if it takes in a lot of the radioactive iodine it is a sign that it is working harder than it needs to. A thyroid scan to see where the radioactive iodine travels in your thyroid gland. If it goes all over your thyroid, that suggests you have Graves’ disease, because with other causes of hypothyroidism, only some parts of the gland are involved.', 'Grave’s Disease Treatment There are two goals in the treatment for Graves’ disease. One is to stop your thyroid gland from overproducing thyroid hormone. The other is to stop the increased levels of thyroid hormone from causing problems in your body. There are a number of treatment options to achieve one or both of these goals.', 'Radioactive iodine therapy With this treatment, you take another form of radioactive iodine by mouth than what is used in the test to diagnose Graves’ disease. The iodine gets into your thyroid and the radiation kills some of the cells in your thyroid that are overproducing thyroid hormones. It’s possible that this treatment could make any eye problems you have from Graves’ disease temporarily worse and it’s also likely it will lead to a lower production of thyroid hormone than is healthy. If that happens, your low thyroid can be treated. Because this treatment uses radiation, it’s not used on pregnant or breastfeeding women .', 'Medications Anti-thyroid medications make your thyroid produce less thyroid hormone. They aren’t permanent treatments but can be used for long periods of time and sometimes help even after you’ve stopped treatment. They’re usually the treatment of choice for pregnant or breastfeeding women who can’t be exposed to radiation. They’re also sometimes used in combination with radioactive iodine therapy. Beta blockers are medications typically used to reduce blood pressure , and they can help rapidly relieve some of the symptoms of hyperthyroidism including shaking, rapid heartbeat, and anxiety.', ""Surgery is a less common treatment for Graves’ disease but may be a good choice if you have a goiter or you’re pregnant and can’t take anti-thyroid medications. During surgery, some or all of your thyroid gland is removed. After surgery, you may need to take a daily thyroid medication for the rest of your life. Although the symptoms can cause discomfort, Graves' disease generally has no long-term adverse health consequences if you get prompt and proper medical care.""]"
49,Grieving and Stages of Grief,"['What Is Grief? Grief is a natural response to losing someone or something that’s important to you. You may feel a variety of emotions, including anger, sadness, or loneliness. You can experience grief for different reasons. Maybe a loved one died, a relationship ended, or you lost your job. Other life changes such as a chronic illness or moving to a new home can also lead to grief. Everyone grieves differently. But if you understand your emotions, take care of yourself, and seek support, you can heal. Everyone experiences grief differently.', ""Types of Grief Uncomplicated grief This used to be called “normal” grief. With this, your grief symptoms are most intense for 6 months after a loss. But they lessen with time. Anticipatory grief In this type of grief, you experience loss before it occurs. This can happen when you learn a loved one has a terminal illness, for example. Inhibited grief This can happen when you don't take time to recognize or process your feelings of grief. It can lead to physical problems, such as panic attacks or trouble sleeping."", ""Complicated grief In some cases, grief doesn’t get better. You may not be able to accept the loss. This is called “complicated grief.” Talk to your doctor if you have: Trouble keeping your normal routines Feelings of depression Thoughts that life isn’t worth living Thoughts of harming yourself Any inability to stop blaming yourself Delayed grief With this type of grief, you don't process your feelings at the time of your loss; instead, you feel and process them weeks, months, or years later. This may happen because the shock of your loss interrupts your ability to deal with grief. Or maybe you're so busy with practical matters that you don't have time to feel grief until a later point in time. Absent grief This is when you don't show any outward signs of grieving. But you may be working through complex feelings internally. Cumulative grief This happens when you're processing multiple losses at once. Maybe you're grieving the loss of a marriage and job at the same time. Cumulative grief makes the grieving process longer and more complicated."", ""Traumatic grief This kind of grief happens when you have prolonged difficulties after a loss, making that make it hard to get on with everyday life. It makes it hard to have any positive memories of the loved one you lost. This type of grief can affect you no matter what age you are. But when it happens to children, it's called Childhood Traumatic Grief. Collective grief This is when you grieve far-reaching losses as part of a group. Examples are natural disasters, school shootings, and pandemics . Prolonged grief disorder Also known as complicated grief, it's very similar to traumatic grief. As this type of grief is intense and lasting, it interferes with your daily life. Your grief doesn't diminish over time. You may need to seek professional help to deal with your feelings and symptoms."", ""Causes of Grief Grief is the experience of coping with loss. It's associated with the death of a loved one, but you can feel grief because of any change that challenges your identity or life routines."", 'You may grieve: The death of your friend, family member, partner, or pet. The end of your marriage or a friendship. Leaving your home, neighborhood, or community. The end of your job or career. Losing financial stability. The death of a dream or goal. Loss of your health. The end of your youth. Being unable to have children. Loss of the life you had before a disability or illness. Your own loss of life as you prepare for death.', 'Stages of Grief Your feelings may happen in phases as you come to terms with your loss. You can’t control the process, but it’s helpful to know the reasons behind your feelings. All people experience grief differently. In the 1960s, Elisabeth Kubler-Ross identified five stages of grief. She was a psychiatrist, author, and pioneer in near-death studies. Those stages are: Denial: When you first learn of a loss, it’s common to think, “This isn’t happening.” You may feel shocked or numb. This is a temporary way to deal with the rush of overwhelming emotions. It’s a defense mechanism. Anger: As reality sets in, you’re faced with the pain of your loss. You may feel frustrated and helpless. These feelings later turn into anger. You might direct it toward other people, a higher power, or life in general. To be angry with a loved one who died and left you alone is natural too. Bargaining: During this stage, you dwell on what you could’ve done to prevent the loss. Thoughts such as “if only…” and “what if…” are common at this stage. You may also try to strike a deal with a higher power. Depression: Sadness sets in as you begin to understand the loss and its effect on your life. Signs of depression include crying, sleep issues , and a decreased appetite. You may feel overwhelmed, regretful, and lonely. Acceptance: In this final stage of grief, you accept the reality of your loss. It can’t be changed. Although you still feel sad, you’re able to start moving forward with your life. Every person goes through these phases in their own way. You may go back and forth between them or skip one or more stages altogether.', ""Symptoms of Grief Physical symptoms Loss can be very stressful and take a physical toll on your body. Grief can affect your nervous system as well as weaken your immune system. Grief symptoms can include: Tiredness Headaches Nausea Upset stomach Joint pain Weak muscles Tightness in your throat or chest Loss of appetite or increased appetite Sleeping too much or too little Emotional symptoms When you're grieving, it's common to feel emotions in waves. There are no right or wrong feelings in grieving. You may feel normal one minute but be in tears the next. You also may have conflicting or confusing emotions, such as: Feeling sad that a loved one died but also a sense of relief that they're not in pain. Missing your spouse after divorce but also feeling happy about a new start. Having guilt for being glad as you no longer have to take care of a dying loved one. Feeling apathy, anger , sadness, and regret, all at the same time, as you grieve the loss of someone with whom you had a difficult relationship."", ""What's a grief trigger? It's a sudden reminder of a loved one who died or something you lost. It can bring strong emotions. These triggers can include songs, places, smells, sounds, and special occasions.

But be careful. These are temporary escapes that won’t make you heal faster or feel better in the long run. In fact, they can lead to addiction, depression, anxiety, or even an emotional breakdown. Instead, try these things to help you come to terms with your loss and begin to heal: Give yourself time. Accept your feelings and know that grieving is a process. Talk to others. Spend time with friends and family. Don’t isolate yourself. Take care of yourself. Exercise regularly, eat well, and get enough sleep to stay healthy and energized. Return to your hobbies. Get back to the activities that bring you joy. Join a support group. Speak with others who are also grieving. It can help you feel more connected. Grief support groups Studies show that participating in a grief support group can help protect you from developing prolonged or complicated grief. Look for one near you by contacting nonprofits like The Compassionate Friends , or you may find grief groups through your doctor, community, or place of worship.', ""How to Help Grieving Loved Ones There are some ways to support your loved ones when they're grieving. Some important steps include: Be there. Ask them what they need. Do they want to talk? Take a walk? Help with arrangements? Support them in the ways they need. Find ways to help . Offer to run errands, drive their kids to school, cook a meal, or help with laundry. Let them know they can talk to you . They may be waiting for a signal that it's alright to share stories and process their feelings. Listen more than you talk. Don’t minimize their loss . Never say a loss wasn’t a big deal, or that they should move on. Don’t put a positive spin on their loss. Statements like “it’s all for the best” or “they’re in a better place now” can sound dismissive. Allow your loved one to process their feelings honestly.

50,Fissured Tongue,"[""If you have fissures in your tongue , it's likely no cause for concern. In fact, certain types of grooves or cracks are considered simply a variation of a normal tongue . Sometimes called a plicated or scrotal tongue , this condition is often harmless. However, it's rarely a good idea to diagnose yourself. So, if you have any concerns, set your mind at ease by discussing this with your doctor or oral specialist."", 'Characteristics of Fissured Tongue These are the characteristics of a fissured tongue: Cracks, grooves, or clefts appear on the top and sides of the tongue. These fissures only affect your tongue. Fissures on the tongue vary in depth, but they may be as deep as 6 millimeters. Grooves may connect with other grooves, separating the tongue into small lobes or sections. Unless debris builds up in these fissures, you are unlikely to have any symptoms. Fissures may first appear during childhood. However, fissures are more common in adults. And, just as wrinkles can deepen with age, fissures can also become more pronounced as you get older. If you have regular dental exams, your dentist has no doubt spotted the fissures on your tongue. This is how most fissures are found.', ""Conditions Associated With Fissured Tongue About 2% to 5% of the U.S. population has a fissured tongue. A fissured tongue may affect men slightly more often than women. Because a fissured tongue can cluster in families, it may be genetically inherited. Although other causes of fissured tongue are unknown, it may appear along with other conditions such as these: Geographic tongue, also known as benign migratory glossitis (BMG). This benign condition often shows up along with fissured tongue. It may cause no symptoms other than sensitivity to hot and spicy foods. Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome. This is a rare condition. It not only causes a fissured tongue, but also lip or facial swelling and paralysis in the face ( Bell's palsy ) that may come and go. Down syndrome . Fissured tongue occurs in as many as 80% of children with the chromosomal disorder Down syndrome. It is not common to need a biopsy of a fissured tongue. If a fissured tongue causes any symptoms, your dentist may encourage you to brush your tongue. This may help remove debris that has built up in deep fissures, causing irritation. In almost all cases, though, no treatment is needed. However, if you have symptoms or any complications of Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome, your dentist or doctor may recommend that you see a specialist.""]"
51,If Your Baby Has Group B Strep,"[""Group B strep is a bacterial infection babies can catch from their mother during childbirth or pick up in their first few months of life. Infants who get this infection can have complications like pneumonia , meningitis , or a blood infection called sepsis . This infection is preventable. If you're pregnant and tests show that you have this type of bacteria, your doctor can give you antibiotics during labor so you don't pass the infection to your baby . And if your baby does get sick, antibiotics can treat the infection."", ""Causes Group B strep bacteria live in the intestines and genital tract, including the vagina . About 1 out of every 4 pregnant women carries these bacteria. It's normal to have these bacteria in your body. Usually you won't know you have them because they won't make you sick. In some cases, they can cause bladder and urinary tract infections (UTIs). Group strep B bacteria aren’t dangerous to you, but if you get pregnant , they are risky for your baby ."", ""How Babies Get It If you carry group B strep bacteria, your baby can become infected during a vaginal delivery.

Babies get this type during delivery. Late-onset starts a week to a few months after the baby is born. This type may be acquired in the home or in the community, and it isn't prevented by antibiotics given during delivery."", 'Symptoms Babies who get this infection may start to have symptoms in the first few days of life, or weeks to months later. You may notice that your little one has: Fever Fast, slow, or strained breathing Trouble eating Extreme fatigue Irritability Blue color to the skin', 'Babies with group B strep bacteria could get serious complications like these: Pneumonia -- a lung infection Meningitis -- inflammation in the lining of the brain and spinal cord Sepsis -- a blood infection These conditions can be life-threatening. They can also lead to long-term problems such as: Hearing loss Learning problems Cerebral palsy Seizures', ""Diagnosis Your OB/GYN might do a urine culture early in your pregnancy to look for group B strep bacteria. You should be tested for it between your 35th and 37th weeks of pregnancy. The doctor will take a swab from your vagina and rectum and send it to a lab. A “positive” result means you carry this type of bacteria. If your newborn shows symptoms of this infection after birth, the doctor can take a sample of the baby's blood or spinal fluid and send it to a lab. The lab will culture the bacteria to see if group B strep bacteria grow. This process can take a few days. A chest X-ray may also help doctors diagnose the infection in babies."", 'Treatments Even before lab results are in, intravenous antibiotic treatment may be started. Your baby might also need treatments to help with GBS symptoms, including: Fluids through a vein (IV) Oxygen Medicines to treat other symptoms', ""Prevention Researchers are working on a vaccine that might one day protect mothers and their babies from this infection. But it’s not ready yet. If tests show that you have group B strep bacteria while pregnant, your doctor will give you antibiotics during labor to prevent you from passing the infection to your baby. Penicillin and ampicillin are two antibiotics commonly used to treat this infection. If you're allergic to penicillin, your doctor can give you a different drug. You need to take antibiotics during labor, not before. If you take them earlier in your pregnancy, the bacteria can come back. You won't need to take antibiotics if you have a C-section before your water breaks. Taking antibiotics during labor will prevent early-onset group B strep infections in your baby. But it won’t lower the odds that your baby will develop the late-onset form. So keep note of any possible symptoms in your baby, particularly in the first three months of life.""]"

53,What Is Grover's Disease?,"['Grover’s disease is a rare, temporary skin condition. It causes sudden red, raised, blistery, and sometimes very itchy spots that form around the middle of the body. The rash is most often seen in middle-aged men. Another name for this condition is transient acantholytic dermatosis (TAD).', 'Who Gets It? Grover’s disease usually happens in men over 50. However, women sometimes get it, too.', 'What Causes It? Scientists aren’t sure what causes Grover’s disease. It may appear for no reason. Some doctors think that sun-damaged skin or extreme swings in temperature play a role. One popular, but unproven, theory is that it may be linked to sweating. Many cases have occurred in men who use hot tubs, steam rooms, electric blankets, and other warming items.\xa0It can also be caused by certain medications, organ transplants, kidney disease, Dialysis, or exposure to x rays.', 'What Are the Symptoms? The main symptoms of Grover’s disease are: Sudden rash on the chest, back, and sometimes arms and legs Blisters containing a thin, watery liquid with a hair follicle in the center Blisters clumped together, surrounded by a red swollen ring Itching, which may be intense Symptoms usually last about 6 to 12 months, but may go away sooner or take longer to disappear.', 'How Is It Diagnosed? Your doctor will examine you and the rash. Sometimes it can be tough to tell the difference between Grover’s disease and other skin disorders. A shaved skin biopsy can confirm the diagnosis.', 'How Is It Treated? If you have a mild rash, the first treatments may include: Antihistamines, taken by mouth Prescription cortisone cream, applied to the rash Other anti-itch lotions that contain menthol or camphor If your symptoms are very bad, your doctor may suggest retinoids or an antibiotic taken by mouth. But, these medicines can cause side effects (some may be severe). Always talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of the medications you are prescribed. Severe, stubborn symptoms can be hard to treat and may keep coming back. This could mean you need long-term treatment. Your doctor may prescribe light therapy combined with medications if this happens. Other treatments that may be used for severe symptoms are: Antifungal pills Antifungal lotions such as selenium sulfide Cortisone shots, Oral corticosteroids Antibiotics Systemic retinoid', 'Your doctor may also suggest you reduce activities that can cause a lot of sweating (like heavy-duty workouts), since sweating can worsen the rash. Your doctor might also recommend that you take fewer baths and showers, and that you don’t spend a lot of time in the sun.']"
54,Porphyria,"['What Is Porphyria? Porphyria is a group of disorders that can cause nerve or skin problems . There\'s no cure, but you can get treatments that will help you manage your symptoms. If you have porphyria that affects your skin , you\'ll hear your doctor call it a ""cutaneous porphyria."" When the condition causes a problem with your nervous system , it\'s called ""acute porphyria.""', 'Porphyria Causes No matter what kind of porphyria you have, it has the same root cause: a problem with how your body makes a substance called heme. Heme is part of the ""hemoglobin"" in your blood -- proteins that carry oxygen from the lungs to the rest of your body. Heme has iron and gives blood its red color. It\'s made in your liver and bone marrow -- the spongy center of your bones. A variety of enzymes play a role in the process. If you have porphyria, your body doesn\'t have enough of some of these enzymes. This shortage leads to a buildup of certain chemicals, called porphyrins, that help make heme.', 'The type of porphyria you have is linked to the specific enzyme that your body lacks. Most types of porphyria are inherited. That means one or both of your parents passes a mutated gene to you that leads to the disease. One common type of cutaneous porphyria, known as porphyria cutanea tarda, is sometimes passed through genes but can also be what doctors call an ""acquired disease."" In that case, certain conditions or actions can trigger symptoms of porphyria. These triggers can be things like: Drinking alcohol Estrogen use by women Hepatitis C HIV Smoking Episodes of acute porphyria, which rarely happen before puberty , can be set off by taking some kinds of drugs , including: Barbiturates Sulfa antibiotics Birth control pills Seizure medicines Other things that might trigger acute porphyria are: Fasting Smoking Drinking alcohol Infections Menstrual hormones Stress Being in the sun', 'Symptoms of Porphyria Symptoms are different depending on the type of porphyria. Symptoms of acute porphyria The symptoms of acute porphyria can develop quickly and last for days or weeks. You might have an imbalance of salt in your body along with this type of porphyria.', 'The symptoms can include: Belly pain , often severe Chest pain Faster heart rate and higher blood pressure Limb and back pain Muscle weakness Tingling and loss of sensation Cramping Vomiting and constipation You may notice changes in your personality, or you may get depression or other mental disorders. You could also feel agitated, confused, or get seizures . Some complications you could get are: Long-term pain Kidney damage Liver cancer Symptoms of cutaneous porphyria Symptoms of cutaneous porphyria happen when your skin is in sunlight. The most commonly affected areas include the face and the back of the: Hands Forearms Ears Neck You may get symptoms on your skin such as: Blisters Itching Swelling Pain More hair growth Darkening and thickening', 'Porphyria Diagnosis Doctors sometimes find it tricky to diagnose porphyria because the symptoms are similar to those of other diseases. If your doctor thinks you have it, they may order blood, urine , and stool tests to get a diagnosis. The best time for you to do these tests is when you have an outbreak of symptoms or around that time.', ""Sometimes you'll get multiple tests to help your doctor figure out which specific type of porphyria you have. Your doctor may also suggest you get a genetic test. Since porphyria often runs in families, your doctor may recommend that others in your family get this test as well. Questions for your doctor What caused my porphyria? Which type do I have? What tests do I need? How can I avoid my triggers? Which treatments do you recommend? How can I protect my skin from the sun?"", ""Porphyria Treatment When you have an outbreak of acute porphyria symptoms, you may need to stay in the hospital. You'll get medicine for pain, nausea, and vomiting. Your doctor may prescribe givosiran (Givlaari), which helps reduce the toxins linked to the attacks. You may also need to get a type of sugar called glucose, which you might take by mouth or get put into your veins through an IV. Your doctor may also give you a shot of hemin ( Panhematin )."", 'If you have cutaneous porphyria, your treatment will depend on the specific type of the disease you have and how severe your symptoms are. If you have porphyria cutanea tarda, your treatment might include: Regular removal of your blood to lower the amount of iron in your liver. This is called phlebotomy . Low doses of the antimalarial drug chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine Your doctor may suggest that you avoid anything that triggers an outbreak. They will also treat conditions you have that bring on porphyria, like HIV or hepatitis C. Doctors for porphyria There are many things you can do to prevent outbreaks and manage your symptoms. You will likely need care from a team of health care professionals. You might see: Hematologists, doctors who treat blood diseases Dermatologists, specialists in skin diseases Hepatologists, doctors who treat liver diseases Genetic counselors, who advise people about their risk for inherited diseases It may take time to find the right doctors, because porphyria is so rare. The American Porphyria Foundation (APF) can help you find a specialist in your area. Good nutrition is another important part of taking care of yourself when you have porphyria. Your doctor or dietitian will help you get the right balance of carbohydrates and nutrients in your meals.', 'Porphyria Complications Complications of acute porphyria Acute porphyria can be life-threatening. Complications can include: Dehydration Breathing problems Seizures High blood pressure Chronic pain Chronic kidney failure Liver damage Complications of cutaneous porphyria Cutaneous porphyria can lead to permanent skin damage. Complications of it can include: Infection Discoloration Fragile skin Scars', 'Porphyria Outlook How porphyria affects you depends on the type you have. Acute porphyria symptoms start quickly and last for a few days or weeks. Severe attacks of acute porphyria can sometimes cause nerve damage and muscle weakness that can take months to get better. Since cutaneous porphyria symptoms start when your skin is in sunlight, staying out of the sun will heal your skin and help prevent permanent damage. Porphyria is a chronic disease, which means symptoms come and go throughout your life. Avoiding your triggers will help prevent bouts of symptoms.', 'Remember that everyone with porphyria is different. Some people have milder symptoms than others. Treatments can help you feel better and prevent complications.', ""Keep in mind that researchers are always testing new treatments in clinical trials . Ask your doctor if you should consider joining one. Getting porphyria support When you're managing porphyria, just as with any other serious medical problem, it's important to reach out to family and friends. They can give you the emotional backing you need and also help with everyday tasks while you get treatment. Your medical team can also offer information and support. They may know about support groups that let you meet others with your condition. Also, check the website of the American Porphyria Foundation. The group hosts patient education sessions where you can learn more about managing your symptoms. It also offers support for caregivers.""]"
55,What Is Parkinson's Disease?,"[""Parkinson's disease is an illness that affects the part of your brain that controls how you move your body. It can come on so slowly that you don't even notice it at first. But over time, what starts as a little shakiness in your hand can have an impact on how you walk, talk, sleep , and think. You're more likely to get it when you're 60 and older. It's also possible for it to start when you're younger, but that doesn't happen nearly as often. There's no cure for Parkinson's disease , but you can get treatment and support to help manage the symptoms."", ""What Does Parkinson's Do to the Brain? Deep down in your brain , there's an area called the substantia nigra, which is in the basal ganglia. Some of its cells make dopamine , a chemical that carries messages around your brain . When you need to scratch an itch or kick a ball, dopamine quickly carries a message to the nerve cell that controls that movement. When that system is working well, your body moves smoothly and evenly. But when you have Parkinson's, the cells of your substantia nigra start to die. There's no replacing them, so your dopamine levels drop and you can't fire off as many messages to control smooth body movements."", ""Early on, you won't notice anything different. But as more and more cells die, you reach a tipping point where you start to have symptoms. That may not be until 80% of the cells are gone, which is why you can have Parkinson's for quite a while before you realize it."", ""How Does Parkinson's Affect the Body? The telltale symptoms all have to do with the way you move. You usually notice problems like: Rigid muscles . It can happen on just about any part of your body. Doctors sometimes mistake early Parkinson's for arthritis . Slow movements . You may find that even simple acts, like buttoning a shirt, take much longer than usual. Tremors . Your hands, arms, legs, lips, jaw, or tongue are shaky when you're not using them. Walking and balance problems . You may notice your arms aren't swinging as freely when you walk. Or you can't take long steps, so you have to shuffle instead. Parkinson's can also cause a range of other issues, from depression to bladder problems to acting out dreams . It may be a while before abnormal movements start."", ""What Causes Parkinson's? Doctors aren't sure why all those brain cells start dying. They think it's a mix of your genes and something in the environment, but the reason is not straightforward. Someone could have a change in a gene tied to Parkinson's, but never get the disease. That happens a lot. And a bunch of people could work side by side in a place with chemicals linked to Parkinson's, but only a few of them end up with it. It's a complex puzzle, and scientists are still trying to put all the pieces together."", ""How Will My Doctor Test for It? There's no one test for Parkinson's . A lot of it's based on your symptoms and health history, but it could take some time to figure it out. Part of the process is ruling out other conditions that look like Parkinson's. The docotor may do a DaT scan, which looks for dopamine in the brain. This can aid in a diagnosis. Because there is no single test, it's very important to go to a doctor who knows a lot about it, early on. It's easy to miss."", ""If you do have it, your doctor might use what's called the Hoehn and Yahr scale to tell you what stage of the disease you're in. It ranks how severe your symptoms are from 1 to 5, where 5 is the most serious. The stage can help you get a better feel for where your symptoms fall and what to expect as the disease gets worse. But keep in mind, some people could take up to 20 years to move from mild to more serious symptoms. For others, the change is much faster."", ""How Is Parkinson's Treated? It's all about managing symptoms. Drugs for Parkinson's can often help with tremors, stiff muscles, and slow movements. Your doctor may also suggest physical therapy , occupational therapy, and speech therapy, based on how it affects you.

For others, the disease is much more serious and really limits what you're able to do. As it gets worse, it makes it harder and harder to do daily activities like getting out of bed, driving, or going to work. Even writing can seem like a tough task. And in later stages, it can cause dementia . Even though Parkinson's can have a big impact on your life, with the right treatment and help from your health care team, you can still enjoy the things you love.

56,What Is Guillain-Barre Syndrome?,"['Guillain-Barre Syndrome is a problem with your nervous system . It can cause muscle weakness, reflex loss, and numbness or tingling in parts of your body. It can lead to paralysis, which is usually temporary. Most people recover, even those with severe cases. In fact, 85% of people with GBS make a full recovery within 6 to 12 months. Once you get better, the chance of it returning is very small.', 'Causes Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) can happen to anyone, but it’s most common in people 50 years old or older. No one’s sure if a germ or virus, like the Zika virus , causes GBS . It could be that some illnesses alter your nerve cells, so your immune system starts to view them as threats. Others think your immune system forgets which cells it shouldn’t attack. It usually shows up a few days or weeks after a cold, stomach virus , or the flu . In rare cases, surgery or vaccinations can trigger it. You may hear your doctor mention “campylobacter.” That’s a type of bacteria associated with GBS. When you have it, your immune system begins attacking your nerve cells. That weakens their ability to send signals to your brain . And your muscles then can’t respond to nerve signals. As a result, your brain gets fewer messages to your body.', 'Symptoms Guillain-Barre syndrome strikes quickly. You usually feel it first in your arms and legs. You may notice muscle weakness or a “pins and needles” tingling in your hands and feet, which later moves toward your midsection. You may also feel unusually tired. Your reflexes may slow. Some people feel only a mild weakness. Others become almost entirely paralyzed and struggle to swallow or breathe. If you feel anything more than mild weakness, you should call 911. Your symptoms can get worse quickly. Most people are at their weakest 3 weeks after symptoms appear.', 'Treatment If your doctor thinks you have GBS, they will give you a test to measure how well your muscles and nerves work. You may also get a spinal tap . A doctor inserts a needle into your lower back and takes a small amount of spinal fluid. They’ll check the protein level; it’s high in people with GBS.', 'If you’re diagnosed with GBS, you should begin treatment right away.', 'In some cases, in order to speed recovery, the doctor will take blood from your body, “clean” it, and then return it to you. This process is called plasmapheresis . Your doctor may give you immunoglobulin, or antibodies. You’ll get high doses of healthy cells through an IV. These help lessen your immune system’s attack on your body. Some people with GBS need to be hospitalized for a few days. Others stay for several weeks. You’ll need support until you regain full control of your body. A nurse or loved one may need to exercise your arms or legs for you.', 'What to Expect It may take a while for you to feel like yourself again. After a hospital stay, you may still feel weak and need a wheelchair or walker to get around. You may have physical therapy to build up your strength . A small number of people also have permanent nerve damage . GBS usually lasts between 14 and 30 days. If your symptoms continue longer, you may be suffering from a chronic form of GBS called chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy and will need more aggressive treatment.']"

That means they'll remove a small piece of your skin and send it to a lab to be viewed under a microscope."", ""Lichen Sclerosus\xa0Complications Serious complications of lichen sclerosus can happen, especially if you don't get treated. Your skin becomes fragile and can easily be damaged, with bleeding, tears, and open sores that may get infected. Lichen sclerosus can cause serious scarring to the outer part of the female genitals, called the vulva, and change the way your genitals look and feel. You may end up with chronic, or ongoing, pain in the vulva and a narrowing of the vaginal opening. These complications can make sex difficult and painful. If your penis is affected, it can make your foreskin thick and less flexible. You may have a hard time retracting it to clean or to pee (phimosis), or your foreskin could get stuck behind the head of your penis (paraphimosis). You may also have pain during sex and trouble peeing. You may also be more likely to develop a type of skin cancer on your vulva or penis."", ""Lichen Sclerosus\xa0Treatments Although there's no cure for lichen sclerosus, there are treatments that can help."", ""If you have it on your genitals, you should get it treated, even if you don't have symptoms. You're more likely to have sex and urinary complications if you don't treat it. Patches on other parts of your body may go away with time. Your doctor will probably first give you a steroid cream to put on the problem area. This can stop the itching. But it may take longer--a few weeks or months--for the skin to return to a more normal appearance. You may need to use these creams or ointments for a long period of time to keep the condition from coming back."", ""You'll need to keep up with your doctor appointments, since long-term use of steroid creams or ointments can make the skin become red or thin and cause stretch marks . The treatment can also cause genital yeast infections . If the cortisone cream or ointment doesn't work for you, there are other treatment options. They include vitamin A -like drugs called retinoids, ultraviolet light therapy, or immune-suppressing creams and ointments. Pimecrolimus and tacrolimus are called calcineurin inhibitors. They calm your immune system by blocking a protein that causes inflammation. That can ease the itching."", ""Lichen Sclerosus\xa0Surgery Surgery to treat lichen sclerosus that's on your penis can be a good option. Doctors often do a circumcision , which is removing the foreskin--the tissue that covers the head of the penis . After that, the condition probably won't come back. If you have severe scarring of your vulva that causes problems with sex, surgery can help. But it's only an option once the condition is under control."", ""Lichen Sclerosus Self-Help It may be hard, but try not to scratch. That can cause even more damage to fragile skin. You may be able to soothe the itch by taking baths in a few inches of plain, lukewarm water . Use only a mild cleanser. Gently pat yourself dry and apply a water-blocking ointment like petroleum jelly to the affected skin. Do the same after you pee so urine doesn't stay on your skin. Avoid tight clothing, perfumed genital sprays, harsh skin cleansers, and scented dryer or fabric sheets. Don't sit around in wet or sweaty clothing after a swim or a workout. It may also help to wear cotton underwear during the day and no underwear when sleeping at night."", ""Lichen Sclerosus Prognosis You can usually get relief from the symptoms of lichen sclerosus with treatment, especially if you catch it early. But it probably won't go away entirely. You'll likely go through periods where it flares up for the rest of your life. It can cause serious complications, including scarring and sexual dysfunction. You'll also need to be screened regularly for skin cancer."", 'Takeaways Lichen sclerosus is a rare condition that causes smooth, white, itchy patches on your skin, usually around your genitals and anus. It can cause disfiguring scarring and put you at greater risk of skin cancer on your penis or vulva. Talk to your doctor if you have genital itching or skin changes, because lichen sclerosus can be managed with treatment.', ""Lichen Sclerosus FAQs What causes lichen sclerosus to flare up? Doctors don't know exactly what causes flares, but things that irritate your skin could be one trigger. A flare may also be a sign that you need to use steroid cream or other medication more often."", ""What is the best thing to do for lichen sclerosus? Talk to your doctor if you have itching or skin changes in your genital area. Lichen sclerosus needs to be treated so you don't have serious complications. Steroid medications you put on your skin and other treatments usually work well. What should you not wear when you have lichen sclerosus? You want to avoid irritating the skin that's affected. Don't wear scratchy fabrics like wool, or tight clothing that rubs or traps moisture next to your skin. Change out of wet or sweaty clothes as soon as you can.""]"
58,Gynecomastia,"['What Is Gynecomastia (Enlarged Breasts in Men)? Gynecomastia is a condition that makes breast tissue swell in boys and men. It can happen when the balance of two hormones in your body is thrown off. If you have enlarged breasts because of fat deposits, you have a different condition called ""pseudogynecomastia."" Although breasts don\'t develop in men the way they do in women, all boys are born with a small amount of breast tissue. Boys\' bodies mostly make a hormone called testosterone , which guides their sexual growth during puberty . But males also make some estrogen -- the hormone that steers sexual growth in girls. When a boy is going through puberty, or when an older man\'s body makes less testosterone, the balance of the two hormones changes. Sometimes when that happens, a higher percentage of estrogen causes male breast tissue to swell. About half of adolescent boys and as many as two-thirds of men older than 50 will have this to some degree.', 'Gynecomastia Symptoms Your first sign of gynecomastia may be a lump of fatty tissue under the nipple. Sometimes this lump is tender or sore. This might make you worry that you have breast cancer , which does occur in a small number of men. Gynecomastia is not necessarily a sign of cancer , but your doctor may run some tests to rule it out. Swelling of the breasts may happen unevenly, with one becoming larger than the other. You may also have breast tenderness. See your doctor if you notice that your breasts have swelling, are painful or tender, or there is a discharge from the nipple of one or both breasts.', ""Gynecomastia Causes A lot of things can trigger the hormone imbalance that causes male breast growth, and many times the exact cause isn't known. In addition to body changes such as puberty and aging, some things that can cause gynecomastia are: Injury or diseases that affect the testicles, which make testosterone Thyroid problems , since hormones from that gland control growth and sexual development Some cancers, including tumors of the lungs , pituitary gland, or adrenal glands Obesity, which can result in more estrogen Illegal drugs , including anabolic steroids , marijuana , and heroin Kidney failure (when they can no longer clean and filter your blood ) Liver disease"", 'Some infant boys may get gynecomastia briefly while hormones from their mother are still in their bodies. Some types of medicines can lead to gynecomastia, such as: Anti-androgens. These are drugs that treat an enlarged prostate or prostate cancer . Anabolic steroids and androgens. Athletes sometimes use these drugs illicitly in an effort to improve their athletic performance. The drugs also have legitimate uses for certain conditions. HIV drugs. Gynecomastia can sometimes be a side effect of an HIV treatment called ""highly active antiretroviral therapy."" Anti-anxiety drugs. Medicines such as diazepam ( Valium ) can sometimes cause gynecomastia. Heart medications. Drugs such asdigoxin (Lanoxin) and calcium channel blockers can lead to gynecomastia sometimes. Medicines used to empty your stomach. For example, metoclopramide ( Reglan ) can have gynecomastia as a side effect. Ulcer drugs. Some medicines that you buy over the counter for ulcers can lead to gynecomastia, such as cimetidine ( Tagamet HB). Some antibiotics can also cause gynecomastia. So can tricyclic antidepressants and some cancer treatments.', 'Gynecomastia Diagnosis If your doctor suspects you have gynecomastia, they will probably examine you to make sure there are no hard lumps, oozing fluid, or skin problems that could be signs of cancer . They will also likely ask you questions about your medical history that might include: Have you had illnesses such as mumps , kidney ailments, or liver disease? What drugs have you taken -- legal or illegal? You might also be given tests. They could include: Blood tests or urine samples Mammogram Biopsy CT scans MRI scans Testicular ultrasounds', 'Gynecomastia Treatment Most cases slowly get better on their own without treatment. When you have gynecomastia, your doctor might refer you to a specialist known as an endocrinologist , who treats problems related to hormones and how they affect your body. How your condition is treated may depend on your age, your health, how long your condition may last, and how well you respond to certain drugs. If gynecomastia happens during puberty, it usually goes away on its own. This might take anywhere from 6 months to 3 years.', ""If it turns out your hormones are out of balance because of another health problem, you'll want to treat that underlying condition. You might be given medication to address the hormone imbalance that's causing breast growth. In some cases, you might need surgery. Your doctor may recommend techniques such as: Liposuction (removal of extra breast fat) Mastectomy (removal of breast gland tissue)"", ""Gynecomastia Prevention There are steps you can take to lower your chances of having gynecomastia. They include things such as: Don't use illicit or recreational drugs, such as anabolic steroids, androgens, amphetamines, marijuana, or heroin. Don't drink alcohol, or drink moderately. Go over your medicine list with your doctor. If any of your medications can cause gynecomastia, ask if there are alternatives."", 'Gynecomastia Complications Gynecomastia can have an impact on your mental health . You might feel embarrassed, or feel anxious or depressed. There are steps you can take to manage these feelings. Talk to you doctor about how gynecomastia is making you feel.

An hour later, you’ll take a blood glucose test to see how your body handled all that sugar. If the results show that your blood sugar is higher than a certain level, you’ll need a 3-hour oral glucose tolerance test.

After that, you’ll take a blood glucose test every hour for the next 3 hours. Your doctor can also test you by having you fast for at least 8 hours, take a blood glucose test, drink a drink containing 75 grams of glucose, and then take a blood glucose test once an hour for the next 2 hours.
