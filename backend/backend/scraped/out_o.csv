0,"Obesity: Symptoms, Causes, Treatment","[""What Is Obesity? Doctors define obesity as a chronic (long-lasting) disease that results when have you have excess body fat that puts your health at risk. It's a complicated condition, and it's about much more than the number on the scale. Carrying extra weight affects the way your body works. These changes influence almost every system\xa0in your body. They contribute to diseases like heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. Obesity is a growing problem in many areas of the world. According to the World Health Organization, more than 4 million people\xa0die every year due to obesity or overweight."", 'Obesity Symptoms Doctors have traditionally used body mass index (BMI) as a tool to determine whether someone is overweight or obese. BMI is a calculation that compares your weight to your height. A BMI of 30 or more is in the obese category. If your BMI is 25 to 29.9, your weight is classified as overweight but not obese. Measuring your waist is another way to check your risk for weight-related conditions. A waist size over 40 inches (102 centimeters) for men or 35 inches (88 centimeters) for women is considered high. Some\xa0day-to-day symptoms you might have with obesity include: Tiredness Joint pain Snoring Getting out of breath easily A hard time doing physical activities', 'Types of Obesity Doctors divide obesity into three classes: Class I: You\'re in this category if your BMI is between 30 and 35. Class II: People in this category have a BMI between 35 and 40. Class III: In this category, your BMI is 40 or above. Morbid obesity You might have heard the term ""morbid obesity"" to refer to obesity that\'s likely to pose serious threats to your health. Doctors formerly used to use this phrase to describe what they now call class III obesity.', ""Causes of Obesity Many things\xa0contribute to obesity, including your genes, your eating patterns, and how much activity you get. Hormones and your emotions play a role, too. Some illnesses and some medications can also lead to weight gain. Other things that may be involved include: Living in areas where healthy food and safe places to exercise aren't easily available Jobs that require you to sit for long periods of time Cultural and family preferences for certain foods Advertising and marketing that make high-calorie food seem more appealing"", ""Obesity Risk Factors You're more likely to have obesity if others in your family\xa0do. Experts think genes affect your metabolism, your appetite, and how much body fat you tend to store. Also, people around you influence your diet and exercise patterns. Other risk factors for obesity include: Age. Your metabolism (the rate at which your body burns calories) often slows down as you get older. You may become less physically active as well. Menopause can also make you more prone to weight gain. Sleep loss. Regularly sleeping less than 7 hours a night causes hormone changes that can boost your appetite and lead you to overeat. Pregnancy. It's easy to gain extra weight during pregnancy, and it can be hard to lose it after you give birth. Stress. People tend to crave high-calorie foods when they're under stress. Certain illnesses and medications. Conditions that can cause weight gain include Cushing, Prader-Willi, and polycystic ovary syndromes. Disabilities and illnesses that make it harder to move around, like arthritis, can contribute, too. Among medications linked to weight gain are some antidepressants, antipsychotics, anti-seizure drugs, beta-blockers, and steroids."", 'Obesity epidemiology Obesity is very common. More than 40% of adults\xa0in the U.S. are considered obese, as are nearly 20% of children. Among adults in the U.S., rates of obesity by race/ethnicity are: Black 50% American Indian/Alaska Native 48% Hispanic 46% White 41% Asian 16% The rates among children are: Hispanic 26% Black 25% White 17% Asian 9% (National obesity rates for American Indian/Alaska Native children were not available.) Obesity is more common in people at middle age and older. By age, obesity rates are: 44% for adults ages 40-59 42% for people 60 and up 40% of those ages 20-39 Although researchers say that overall rates of obesity are similar for men and women, women are more likely to have severe, or class 3, obesity.', ""Obesity Diagnosis To screen you for obesity, your doctor might talk to you about your health history\xa0to learn about your eating and activity patterns, history of weight gain and loss, and more. They may also do a: Physical exam. They'll check vital signs like your blood pressure and heart rate as well as measure your height and weight. BMI calculation . Your doctor can use your height and weight to determine your BMI. But because it's based on averages, BMI isn't always an accurate measure of obesity. For example, athletes may have high BMIs although their body-fat levels are low. BMI also doesn't recognize differences in age, gender, or race. Your doctor should take these limitations into account. Waist measurement . Your doctor may also measure around your waist to see if you carry extra abdominal fat. This type of fat boosts your risk for health issues like diabetes and heart disease. Tests for other conditions. Your doctor may want to check you for weight-related conditions like diabetes and high cholesterol. They may also look for illnesses that could cause weight gain, such as thyroid problems."", 'Obesity Treatment There are many treatments for weight loss that can make a big difference to your health and how you feel. Even a small reduction in weight benefits your health. No matter what type of treatment or program you use, overcoming obesity will require you to change your eating and exercise habits. Your doctor can help you determine what method might be best for you. You might start with a supervised weight loss and exercise program .\xa0Ask your doctor to help you set personal goals and refer you to other professionals who can help. For example, a dietitian can work with you to develop a plan for healthy nutrition, and a physical therapist or trainer can help you move more. A bariatric medicine or weight loss specialist can also be a part of your health care team. You’ll want to go for steady progress over time and to make lifestyle changes that work for you in the long run. That way you can start losing weight, feel better, and keep the weight off.', 'Medications for obesity Along with lifestyle changes, your doctor may recommend prescription medications that decrease your appetite, help you feel full with less food, or help you lose weight in other ways. Keep in mind that these drugs may not work for\xa0everyone, and you might regain weight when you stop taking them. Some drugs the FDA has approved to treat obesity\xa0are: Benzphetamine ( Didrex, Regimex) Buproprion-naltrexone (Contrave) Cellulose and citric acid (Plenity) Diethylpropion (Depletite, Radtue, Tenuate) Liraglutide (Saxenda) Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (Vyvanse) Orlistat (Alli, Xenical) Phendimetrazine (Bontril, Melfiat) Phentermine (Adipex, Lomaira, Suprenza) Phentermine-topiramate (Qsymia) Semaglutide (Wegovy) SGLT2 inhibitors with glucagon-like-1 receptor agonists Doctors may also prescribe certain diabetes drugs, such as tirzepatide (Mounjaro), ""off-label"" for weight loss even though they\'re not FDA-approved for that purpose. Find out about the latest drug treatments for obesity. Procedures and surgeries for obesity These procedures change your digestive system to limit how much food you\'re able to eat or how many calories your body can absorb. \xa0Some also affect hormones that play a role in hunger and metabolism.', ""These procedures may not only help with weight loss but also improve weight-related conditions like type 2 diabetes and heart disease. If you get one of them, you'll still need to adopt healthy lifestyle changes. Nonsurgical procedures include: Endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty , in which a doctor puts stitches in your stomach to reduce how much it can hold. Intragastric balloon , in which a balloon is placed into your stomach, then filled with water, to help you feel full sooner. If you have class 3 obesity, you might be able to get weight loss (bariatric) surgery. These surgeries include: Gastric band , in which a band separates your stomach into two smaller compartments Gastric bypass , in which the doctor creates a smaller compartment within your stomach and connects it right to your small intestine. Gastric sleeve, where the surgeon removes part of your stomach. Duodenal switch, which combines gastric sleeve surgery with a procedure that bypasses much of the small intestine. Therapy for obesity"", ""Cognitive behavioral therapy\xa0teaches you behavior changes that can lead to weight loss, such as finding non-food ways to reward yourself or deal with negative emotions. It can also help you learn techniques to reduce stress, which often contributes to overeating. Alternative treatments for obesity You can buy many types of herbs and supplements that claim to help with weight loss. But there's little scientific evidence\xa0that any of them are effective. Some research has found that acupuncture or acupressure\xa0could have a small effect on weight. These techniques stimulate certain spots on your body to try to boost levels of serotonin, a chemical involved in moods, emotions, and appetite. There's some evidence that hypnosis\xa0might help with weight loss, especially when used together with therapy, diet, and exercise. But not all research into this technique showed the same results. Learn more about the treatment options for obesity ."", ""Obesity Health Disparities Anyone can have obesity, but it's more common in minority populations. \xa0Scientists don't know all of the reasons why. They include genetics\xa0as well as family and cultural eating habits. They may also include social aspects like: Lack of regular access to good-quality food (food insecurity) Unemployment rates Easy access to unhealthy foods Lack of access to suitable places to exercise Lack of access to health care Stress and trauma levels"", ""Men have similar rates of obesity no matter what their income level.\xa0High-income women are less likely to have it than those with lower incomes. But most women with obesity aren't considered low-income. In the U.S.,\xa0people living in the Southeast and in rural areas are at higher risk. Black people are often less likely than others to be diagnosed with obesity, although they have the condition at higher rates. Some research has found obesity treatments aren't as widely used or as effective for minorities. One study found that after 6 months of behavior therapy\xa0for weight loss, Black participants lost less weight than White ones. Certain weight loss drugs, such as orlistat, may be less effective for Black people. Others, like metformin, might not work as well for Hispanic people. Members of racial and ethnic minority groups tend to lose less weight after weight loss surgery. Men and African-American people are less likely to consider the surgery in the first place."", ""Obesity Stigma One of the hardest parts of living with obesity is the stigma\xa0that surrounds it. Some people stereotype those with obesity as undisciplined or lazy. You may face discrimination in the workplace and from health care providers. Research suggests that people who have obesity deal with stigma almost every day. But there are signs of progress. In 2013, the American Medication Association recognized obesity as a chronic disease. And advocacy organizations like the World Obesity Federation\xa0and Obesity Action Coalition are bringing attention to the need for change. Stigma can take a toll on your mental health. There's not a lot of research on obesity stigma. But one study found that people who dealt with it by reframing their bad experiences in a more positive way had less depression and better self-esteem. For example, they focused on good things that have happened to them and reminded themselves that many people like them just as they are."", 'Complications of Obesity Extra weight means extra stress on your bones and muscles and less space for your lungs and other organs. It makes your heart and circulation system work harder and increases inflammation in your body. Obesity raises your risk of several other chronic conditions, including:', ""Type 2 Diabetes When you have obesity, you're seven times\xa0more likely to get type 2 if you're male (or were assigned male gender at birth). You're 12 times more likely to get it if you're female or were assigned female at birth. Cardiovascular d isease Obesity boosts your risk for high cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood sugar as well as inflammation. All these things are risk factors for cardiovascular (heart and blood vessel) conditions like heart attack, stroke, and coronary artery disease. Cancer People with obesity are at higher risk for several types of cancer, including: Breast Colorectal Esophageal Ovarian Pancreatic Uterine Digestive Conditions With obesity, you're more prone to heartburn and gallbladder disease as well as liver problems like fatty liver disease. Fatty liver disease happens when too much fat builds up in your liver and leads to damage. Obesity also puts you at higher risk\xa0for: Osteoarthritis Sleep apnea Asthma Infertility Pregnancy complications Back pain Alzheimer's disease Depression"", ""Living With Obesity While not everyone\xa0with obesity has other serious health problems, research shows that it's rare to be both obese and healthy for the long term. But you don't need to lose a lot of weight to improve your health. You could lower your risk for complications like diabetes and heart failure by 10%-25%\xa0by losing just 15-20 pounds. Obesity diet No single diet is best for weight loss. What works for one person may not work for another. Your doctor or a dietitian can help you find an eating plan that suits your needs and lifestyle. In general, a healthy plan will include: Tracking your food intake Controlling portions Making healthier choices, such as eating more fruits and veggies and less saturated fat and cholesterol Be wary of fad diets that promise fast weight loss. While you might lose some weight quickly, you're likely to gain it back once you go off the diet. It's better to adopt changes you can live with long-term. Along with diet, exercise should be part of your weight loss plan. Ask your doctor about what kind of exercise, and how much, is best for you."", ""Obesity costs Obesity and the medical conditions that can come with it bring extra expenses for treatments, doctor visits, hospitalizations, and more. A 2021 study\xa0found that, on average, adults in the U.S. with obesity spent $1,800 more on health care than others. That doesn't include indirect costs like: Missed time and reduced productivity at work Disability and insurance expenses The costs of weight loss programs Managing obesity These steps can boost your chances for successfully managing obesity: Get support. Tell your family members and friends you need their help making lifestyle changes. Support groups, whether they're nonprofit groups or part of a paid program, can be invaluable. Sharing your experiences with others can help you learn ways to succeed and keep you from getting discouraged. People who join these groups tend to lose more weight than those who do it on their own. Write things down. This can help in a few ways. Tracking your food intake and exercise, on paper or in an app, helps you identify and correct unhealthy habits. Journaling about your emotions helps you sort them out and learn what triggers you to eat more. Keeping records of these things makes it easy to share your learnings with doctor or mental health professional. Set goals . Make them small and realistic. Instead of vowing to lose 10 pounds in a month, for example, substitute fresh fruit for dessert every night this week. Or take a 10-minute walk after dinner. Once you've conquered one goal, set another. Find supportive health care providers who understand obesity is a disease and don't make you feel stigmatized. Ask your doctors to discuss all your options for treating obesity. Ease stress. Relaxation techniques like meditation, deep breathing, and stepping away from social media can help you manage stress. That can help you avoid emotional eating and deal with the challenges of obesity."", 'Obesity and mental health People with obesity are at higher risk for mood and anxiety disorders. One study found that those with obesity were 55% more likely\xa0than others to develop depression during their lifetimes. At the same time, people with depression had a 58% higher chance of obesity.', ""Some of the reasons for this link include: Obesity bias . Discrimination is stressful. It can harm your self-esteem and cause you to take others' negative opinions about your weight to heart (internalize them). Negative body image . You may be unhappy with your appearance because it doesn't fit society's norms. You may fear being judged or be embarrassed about your weight. Reduced quality of life . Obesity can keep you from doing things you enjoy and cause you to become isolated. Pain and discomfort caused by obesity or related health conditions also contribute to depression. Physical changes . Excess fat boosts inflammation in your body. Inflammation helps raise your risk for depression. Emotional eating . Many people use food to help them deal with feelings of sadness, stress, or anxiety. Depression saps your energy . When you're depressed, you may not feel up to exercise or take part in other healthy lifestyle habits. Losing weight can help ease depression. But you're not likely to succeed at weight loss when you're feeling sad or stressed. Think about getting treatment for any emotional health issues before you try to overhaul your eating and exercise habits."", ""Obesity Prognosis Can obesity be cured? Some obesity experts believe diet and exercise just aren't enough to address obesity. They say our bodies evolved to help us survive periods when food was scarce. So whenever we cut back on calories, our bodies drive us to eat high-calorie foods and gain weight. That's why most weight loss efforts don't succeed in the end. These experts believe that people with obesity who do manage to lose weight are biologically different from people who've never had obesity. They consider obese people who've lost weight to be in remission rather than cured. What to expect with obesity Even moderate obesity (defined as having a BMI of 30-35) can shorten your lifespan by 3 years. Severe obesity (a BMI of 40-50), could take 10 years off your life. That's about the same as a lifetime of smoking. Weight loss can prevent and sometimes reverse most of the health problems linked to obesity. But losing weight and keeping it off takes commitment and time. While many people can lose some weight with diet and exercise alone, only 10% to 20%\xa0are able to maintain the loss for a long time."", 'Research shows that treatment programs\xa0in which you and your doctor work closely together are most effective for long-term weight loss.\xa0Weight loss surgery\xa0has a high success rate: Some 90% of people who have it are able to lose at least 50% of their extra weight and maintain the loss. And some newer obesity medications are so promising that many doctors consider them game-changers.', ""Obesity Prevention It's easier to prevent obesity than to treat it. If obesity runs in your family or you notice you've picked up a few pounds, start taking simple steps to improve your health habits. You might: Give up soda in favor of unsweetened soda water. Add a 30-minute walk or other workout 5 days a week. Stop keeping fatty, sugary foods in the house. Limit screen time to an hour a day on most days of the week."", ""Takeaways Obesity is not a personal failing. It's a complicated disease that requires lifelong management. Fortunately, more treatment options are available than ever before. Work together with your doctor to get control of your weight and your health.""]"
1,Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD),"[""What Is Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder? Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a mental illness that causes repeated unwanted thoughts or sensations (obsessions). It also can give you an urge to do something over and over again (compulsions). Some people have both obsessions and compulsions. OCD isn’t about habits like biting your nails or thinking negative thoughts. An obsessive thought might be that certain numbers or colors are “good” or “bad.” A compulsive habit might be to wash your hands seven times after touching something that could be dirty. Although you may not want to think or do these things, you feel like you can't stop. Everyone has habits or thoughts that repeat sometimes. People with OCD have thoughts or actions that: Take up at least an hour a day Are beyond your control Aren’t enjoyable Interfere with work, your social life, or another part of life"", 'OCD Types and Symptoms OCD comes in many forms, but most cases fall into at least one of four general categories: Checking, such as locks, alarm systems, ovens, or light switches, or thinking you have a medical condition like pregnancy or schizophrenia . Contamination, a fear of things that might be dirty or a having a compulsion to clean (you may hear this called "" obsessive cleanliness disorder""). Mental contamination involves feeling like you’ve been treated like dirt. Symmetry and ordering, the need to have things lined up in a certain way. Ruminations and intrusive thoughts, an obsession with a line of thought. Some of these thoughts might be violent or disturbing. [Self-Test] Do You Have Symptoms of OCD ?', 'Obsessions and Compulsions Many people who have OCD know that their thoughts and habits don’t make sense. They don’t do them because they enjoy them, but because they can’t quit. And if they stop, they feel so bad that they start again. Obsessive thoughts can include: Worries about yourself or other people getting hurt Constant awareness of blinking, breathing , or other body sensations Suspicion that a partner is unfaithful with no reason to believe it Worries about germs and dirt touching your body Compulsive habits can include: Doing tasks in a specific order every time or a certain “good” number of times Needing to count things, like steps or bottles Fear of touching doorknobs, using public toilets, or shaking hands Rituals of washing and cleaning', 'OCD Causes and Risk Factors Doctors aren’t sure why some people have OCD. Stress can make symptoms worse. It’s a bit more common in women than in men. Symptoms often appear in teens or young adults.', ""OCD risk factors include: A parent, sibling, or child with OCD Physical differences in certain parts of your brain Depression, anxiety, or tics Experience with trauma A history of physical or sexual abuse as a child Sometimes, a child might have OCD after a streptococcal infection. This is called pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections, or PANDAS . What Causes the Compulsion to Wash? Experts believe OCD is caused by an abnormality in the\xa0brain's circuitry.\xa0Brain scans show\xa0brain activity is different in people with OCD. There's probably a genetic component too, especially when OCD begins in childhood. Of all adults with OCD, 1/3 to 1/2 say their illness started in childhood or adolescence. Why is someone with the disease compelled to wash, as opposed to check or count or hoard? That's not known. It's true that with all types of OCD, you may act out a compulsion to relieve anxiety produced by an obsessive, intrusive thought."", 'OCD Diagnosis Your doctor may do a physical exam and blood tests to make sure something else isn’t causing your symptoms. They will also talk with you about your feelings, thoughts, and habits.', 'OCD Treatment There’s no cure for OCD. But you may be able to manage how your symptoms affect your life through medicine, therapy, or a combination of treatments. Treatments include: Psychotherapy. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) can help change your thinking patterns. In a form called exposure and response prevention, your doctor will put you in a situation designed to create anxiety or set off compulsions. You’ll learn to lessen and then stop your OCD thoughts or actions. Relaxation. Simple things like meditation, yoga , and massage can help with stressful OCD symptoms. Medication. Psychiatric drugs called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors help many people control obsessions and compulsions. They might take 2 to 4 months to start working. Common ones include citalopram (Celexa), clomipramine (Anafranil), escitalopram (Lexapro), fluoxetine (Prozac), fluvoxamine, paroxetine (Paxil), and sertraline (Zoloft). If you still have symptoms, your doctor might give you antipsychotic drugs like aripiprazole (Abilify) or risperidone (Risperdal). Neuromodulation. In rare cases, when therapy and medication aren’t making enough of a difference, your doctor might talk to you about devices that change the electrical activity in a certain area of your brain. One kind, transcranial magnetic stimulation, is FDA-approved for OCD treatment. It uses magnetic fields to stimulate nerve cells. A more complicated procedure, deep brain stimulation , uses electrodes that are implanted in your head.', ""The Role of Family Members Families often make the mistake of enabling loved ones with OCD. For instance, a person who sees their partner cleaning the house 3 or 4 hours a day may at first think they've got the world's greatest partner. But that same person may later see their partner is irritable, exhausted, and their cleaning patterns are bizarre. So they may ask whether they think there's an issue. The partner may agree to get treatment because the person spoke up. In this way, family members can play an important role in supporting a person with OCD. They may steer a loved one toward a diagnosis or help with treatment. They may participate in therapy. There are also support groups for people who have a loved one with OCD."", 'OCD-Related Conditions Some separate conditions are similar to OCD. They involve obsessions with things like: Your looks (body dysmorphic disorder ) Collecting, arranging, or ordering things (hoarding disorder) Pulling out/eating your hair (trichotillomania) Picking at your skin (excoriation) Worrying about your physical health (hypochondriasis) Body odor or how you smell (olfactory reference syndrome)']"
2,Blood Tests,"[""Who Gets These Tests? All women should get certain blood tests when they're pregnant. Blood tests check on your health and help rule out problems."", ""What the Tests Do When you first get pregnant , your doctor will take a blood sample. The lab will check for problems that could affect you and your baby. They include rubella, cystic fibrosis , sickle cell anemia, hepatitis B, many sexually transmitted diseases, and others. Your doctor will also use the sample to check your blood type, Rh factor, glucose, cell counts, and hemoglobin , the protein that carries oxygen throughout your body. Later on, you will get your blood tested again. These tests can check for gestational diabetes, infections, and gauge your baby's risk of birth defects. (These tests can be done at many points in the pregnancy. Genetic testing is most often done in the first trimester now and is optional.)"", 'How the Tests Are Done Blood tests are safe for you and your baby. A technician will draw a small amount of blood from your arm.', 'What to Know About Test Results If any of your test results are abnormal, your doctor will probably suggest follow-up tests. If there is a problem, treatment or extra monitoring will help keep you and your baby healthy.', ""How Often the Tests Are Done During Your Pregnancy You'll get a blood test during your first prenatal visit. In your second trimester , you will get a blood test to check for diabetes and recheck your hemoglobin. If you are Rh negative, your antibodies will be rechecked. You may get other blood tests, depending on your preferences and health."", 'Other Names for These Tests Rh factor, First Trimester Screening, Quad Screen, STD Tests, Prenatal labs', 'Tests Similar to This One Urine test']"
3,Heart Disease and Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy,"['What Is Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy? Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is associated with thickening of the heart muscle, most commonly at the septum between the ventricles, below the aortic valve. This may lead\xa0to stiffening of the walls of the heart and abnormal aortic and mitral heart valve function, both of which may impede normal blood flow out of the heart.', 'What Are the Symptoms of Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy? Many people with HCM have no symptoms or only minor symptoms and live a normal life. Other people develop symptoms, which progress and worsen as heart function worsens. Symptoms of HCM can occur at any age and may include: Chest pain or pressure (occurs usually with exercise or physical activity, but can also occur with rest or after meals) Shortness of breath (dyspnea) , especially with exertion Fatigue (feeling overly tired) Fainting (caused by irregular heart rhythms, abnormal responses of the blood vessels during exercise, or no cause may be found) Palpitations (fluttering in the chest) due to abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias), such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia Sudden death (occurs in a small number of patients with HCM)', 'What Causes Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy? HCM can run in families, but the condition may also be acquired as a part of aging or high blood pressure. In other instances, the cause is unknown.', 'How Is Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Diagnosed? HCM is diagnosed based on medical history (your symptoms and family history), a physical exam , and echocardiogram results. Additional tests may include blood tests, electrocardiogram, chest X-ray, exercise stress test , cardiac catheterization, CT scan, and MRI.', 'How Is Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Treated? Treatment of HCM depends on whether there is narrowing in the path that blood takes to leave the heart (called the outflow tract); how the heart is functioning; and if arrhythmias are present. Treatment is aimed at preventing symptoms and complications and includes risk identification and regular follow-up, lifestyle changes, medications , and procedures as needed.', 'What Lifestyle Changes Are Recommended to Treat Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy? Diet. Maintain adequate hydration, unless your doctor is restricting your fluids (fluid and salt restrictions may be necessary for some patients if heart failure symptoms are present). Ask your doctor about specific fluid and dietary guidelines, including information about alcoholic beverages and caffeinated products. Exercise. Your doctor will tell you if you may exercise or not. Most people with cardiomyopathy are able to do non-competitive aerobic exercise . However, your doctor may ask you not to exercise, based on your symptoms and the severity of your disease. Heavy weight lifting is not recommended. Regular follow-up visits. Patients with HCM should have an annual follow-up visit with their cardiologist to monitor their condition. Follow-up appointments may be more frequent when HCM is first diagnosed.', 'What Medications Are Used to Treat Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy? Drugs are often used to treat symptoms and prevent further complications of HCM. Medications can help relax the heart and reduce the degree of obstruction so the heart can pump more efficiently. Beta-blockers and calcium channel blocker blockers are two classes of medications that may be prescribed. If you have an arrhythmia , your doctor may prescribe medications to control your heart rate or decrease the occurrence of arrhythmias.', ""You may be told to avoid certain medications, such as nitrates, because they lower blood pressure , or digoxin , because it increases the force of the heart's contraction. Both obstructive and non-obstructive HCM symptoms may be treated with medications. If heart failure occurs, treatment is aimed at controlling it through heart failure medications and diet changes. Your doctor will discuss which medications are best for you."", 'What Procedures Are Used to Treat Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy? Procedures used to treat HCM include: Septal myectomy. During this surgical procedure, the surgeon removes a small amount of the thickened septal wall of the heart to widen the outflow tract (the path the blood takes) from the left ventricle to the aorta . Ethanol ablation. First, a cardiologist (heart doctor) performs a cardiac catheterization to locate the small coronary artery that supplies blood flow to the septum. A balloon catheter is inserted into the artery and inflated. A contrast agent is injected to locate the swollen septal wall that narrows the passageway from the left ventricle to the aorta. When the abnormal area\xa0is located, a tiny amount of pure alcohol is injected through the catheter. The alcohol kills the cells on contact, causing a small ""controlled"" heart attack . The septum then shrinks back to a more normal size over the following months, widening the passage for blood flow. Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators (ICD). ICDs are suggested for people at risk for life-threatening arrhythmias or sudden cardiac death. The ICD constantly monitors the heart rhythm. When it detects a very fast, abnormal heart rhythm, it delivers energy to the heart muscle to cause the heart to beat in a normal rhythm again.', 'Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy, Sudden Death, and Endocarditis A small number of people with HCM have an increased risk of sudden cardiac death. People at risk include: Those who have family members who have had sudden cardiac death Young people with HCM who have had several episodes of fainting Those who have an abnormal blood pressure response with exercise Adults who have a history of arrhythmia with a fast heart rate Those with severe symptoms and poor heart function If you have two or more risk factors for sudden cardiac death, your doctor may treat you with medications to prevent arrhythmias or with an ICD. Most people with HCM are at low risk for sudden cardiac death. Talk to your doctor about any concerns you may have.', 'How Can I Prevent Endocarditis? People with obstructive HCM may be at increased risk for infective endocarditis, a potentially life-threatening condition. Ask your doctor if you need to take endocarditis precautions, which include: Telling all your doctors and dentist you have HCM. They might prescribe antibiotics to prevent an infection before performing any procedures on you that may cause bleeding (dental, respiratory, and gastrointestinal procedures). Calling your doctor if you have symptoms of an infection. Taking good care of your teeth and gums.', '']"
4,Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA),"[""What Is Obstructive Sleep Apnea? Obstructive sleep apnea is when something blocks part or all of your upper airway while you sleep. Your diaphragm and chest muscles have to work harder to open your airway and pull air into your lungs . Your breath can become very shallow, or you may even stop breathing briefly. You usually start to breathe again with a loud gasp, snort, or body jerk. You may not sleep well, but you probably won't know that it’s happening. The condition can also lower the flow of oxygen to your organs and cause uneven heart rhythms."", ""Obstructive Sleep Apnea Symptoms Common obstructive sleep apnea warning signs include: Daytime sleepiness or fatigue Dry mouth or sore throat when you wake up Headaches in the morning Trouble concentrating, forgetfulness, depression , or crankiness Night sweats Restlessness during sleep Problems with sex , like a low sex drive Snoring Waking up suddenly and feeling like you're gasping or choking Trouble getting up in the mornings Waking up often in the middle of the night to pee High blood pressure Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)"", ""If you share a bed with someone, they'll probably notice your sleep apnea before you do.

They may also want to ask people who live with you about your sleep\xa0habits. You may need to spend a night in a sleep lab or have a sleep study done at your house. You’ll wear monitors to measure things such as: Air flow Blood oxygen levels Breathing patterns Electrical activity in your brain Eye movement Heart rate or rhythm Muscle activity and movement of your arms and legs The study will track how many times you had breathing problems while you slept.', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea Treatment Possible treatment options for obstructive sleep apnea include: Weight loss , if needed. Losing even 10% of your weight can make a difference. Not drinking alcohol or taking sleeping pills. These make your airway more likely to close during sleep and keep you from breathing like you should for longer periods. Sleeping on your side. This can help if you get mild sleep apnea only when you sleep on your back. Nasal sprays. These can help if sinus problems or nasal congestion make it harder to breathe while you sleep.', 'CPAP machine. This device includes a mask that you wear over your nose, mouth , or both. An air blower forces constant air through your nose or mouth . The air pressure is just enough to keep your upper airway tissues from relaxing too much while you sleep. A similar device is the BPAP, which has two levels of air flow that change when you breathe in and out. Oral devices. If you have mild sleep apnea , you might get dental appliances or oral ""mandibular advancement"" devices that keep your tongue from blocking your throat or bring your lower jaw forward. That may help keep your airway open while you sleep. A trained dental expert can decide which type of device may be best for you. Surgery. This is for people who have extra or uneven tissue that blocks airflow through the nose or throat. For example, if you have a deviated nasal septum, swollen tonsils, and adenoids , or a small lower jaw that causes your throat to be too narrow, surgery might help you. Doctors usually try other treatments first.', 'Types of surgery for obstructive sleep apnea include: Upper airway stimulator . This device, called Inspire, has a small pulse generator that your surgeon puts under the skin in your upper chest. A wire leading to your lung tracks your natural breathing pattern. Another wire, leading up to your neck, delivers mild signals to nerves that control your airway muscles, keeping them open. You can use a remote to turn it on before bed and turn it off in the morning. Somnoplasty. Your doctor\xa0uses radiofrequency energy to tighten the tissue at the back of your throat. UPPP, or UP3. This procedure takes out soft tissue in the back of your throat and palate, making your airway wider at your throat opening. (UPPP stands for uvulopalatopharyngoplasty.) Nasal surgery . These operations correct obstructions in your nose, such as a deviated septum (when the wall between your nostrils is off-center). Mandibular/maxillary advancement surgery. Your doctor moves your jawbone and face bones forward to make more room in the back of your throat.

6,"Apraxia: Symptoms, Causes, Tests, Treatments","[""What Is Apraxia? Apraxia is a neurological condition that makes it difficult or impossible to make certain movements. This happens even though your muscles are normal and you have the understanding and desire to make these movements. It's caused by damage to your brain that keeps it from forming and giving instructions to your body. It can affect you in several different ways, depending on what type you have. Dyspraxia Milder forms of apraxia are known as dyspraxia. This condition starts in childhood and causes problems with movement and coordination. It can affect both your fine and gross motor skills, as well as your balance and motor planning. This may make it hard to do things like riding a bike, writing, or tying your shoe. Dyspraxia isn’t as severe as apraxia because you only lose part of your motor ability. With apraxia, you totally lose your ability to make certain movements. You might also hear dyspraxia called developmental coordination disorder (DCD)."", ""Types of Apraxia There are multiple forms of apraxia, and each affects your body differently. Apraxia of speech With apraxia of speech, sometimes called verbal apraxia, it's hard or impossible to move your\xa0mouth and tongue to form words. This happens even though you have the desire to speak and your mouth and tongue muscles are physically able to form words. There are two forms of apraxia of speech -- acquired apraxia and childhood apraxia of speech: Acquired apraxia of speech. Also known as verbal apraxia or oral apraxia, it can affect people of all ages, though it's usually found in adults. It causes you to lose the speech-making abilities you once had. When it affects adults, it's sometimes called adult apraxia of speech. Childhood apraxia of speech. This is a motor speech disorder that you're born with. It affects a child's ability to form sounds and words. It isn’t a muscle issue; it happens because your child’s brain has a hard time planning for and directing the movements of their lips, jaw, and tongue. Children who have it are often far better at understanding speech than at expressing themselves with spoken words. Most children with childhood apraxia of speech\xa0can get much better, if not recover completely, with the right treatment."", ""Oral apraxia This disorder affects the movements of your jaw, lips, tongue, and palate. Along with speech issues, it can cause problems with eating and drinking. Ideational apraxia With this condition, your brain can't make a plan for motor tasks that require multiple steps, such as brushing your teeth. Ideomotor apraxia This is the most common type of apraxia. When you have it, you’re unable to follow instructions or copy the actions of someone else to make movements with your head, arms, or legs. This includes things such as waving and using a hammer. Conceptual apraxia This is similar to ideomotor apraxia, but it’s more serious because your brain doesn’t understand how tools are used. For instance, you may try to use a hammer as a screwdriver or a pen. Buccofacial apraxia Also known as orofacial apraxia, this condition makes you unable to voluntarily make certain movements involving your facial muscles. For instance, you may not be able to lick your lips or wink."", 'Oculomotor apraxia With this condition, you have a hard time moving your eyes in the direction you want. Constructional apraxia When you have constructional apraxia, you can’t draw or copy simple shapes or build simple objects. Limb-kinetic apraxia With this condition, you have a hard time moving a finger, arm, or leg exactly the way you want to. For example, you may be unable to button a shirt.', ""Apraxia vs. Aphasia Apraxia is sometimes confused with aphasia , another communication disorder. That confusion can be complicated by the fact that the two conditions can occur together. People with apraxia and aphasia might both have trouble expressing themselves with words. But there are differences between the two conditions. Aphasia is a condition that affects your ability to understand or use words effectively. This may make it hard to speak, read, or write. But apraxia isn't a problem with understanding language. It's when you have a hard time starting and completing the movements needed to speak. This happens even though you don't have weakness in the muscles you use to speak."", 'Symptoms of Apraxia The main symptom of apraxia is being unable to make voluntary movements or gestures even though you have the physical ability and understanding to do so. The types of movement and the muscle groups that are affected depend on the part of your brain that’s involved. Depending on what type you have, symptoms may include issues with: Facial movements such as coughing or winking Precise movements using your finger , arm, or leg Using specific tools for specific tasks Moving your eyes Carrying out complicated tasks such as brushing your teeth or tying your shoe Mimicking movements with your head, arms, or legs Taking small steps Copying simple drawings Apraxia of speech can affect the way you speak in several different ways. Early signs of apraxia of speech in children may include: Very little babbling (in infants) Little variety in the sounds they make Omitting sounds within words, especially at the beginning of a word Being able to say a sound or word properly at certain times but not always Losing the ability to say a word they already learned Often using nonverbal forms of communication, such as nodding or pointing', 'Childhood apraxia of speech often comes with other language or thinking and memory deficits, which may bring symptoms such as: Trouble chewing and swallowing Clumsiness If you have adult apraxia of speech, you may Speak slowly Say one word when you mean another, like “kitchen” instead of “chicken” Move your lips and tongue around a lot as you try to make certain sounds, a process called groping Have no trouble with words or phrases you often say, like “good morning” Lose the ability to make any sounds in serious cases', 'What Causes Apraxia? Apraxia happens when certain parts of your brain aren’t working the way they should, particularly the parietal lobe. This can be caused by some diseases, but it usually results from\xa0brain damage\xa0to areas of the\xa0brain\xa0that contain memories of how to perform learned tasks. Apraxia can also be caused by damage to other brain areas. Conditions that can lead to apraxia include\xa0head trauma, stroke, dementia, and a\xa0brain tumor.', ""Experts don't yet understand what causes childhood apraxia of speech. Some scientists believe it results from signaling problems between the brain and the muscles used for speaking. Ongoing research is focusing on whether brain abnormalities that cause apraxia of speech can be identified. Other research is looking for genetic causes of this type of apraxia. Some studies are trying to determine exactly which parts of the brain are linked to the condition."", ""Apraxia Diagnosis Tests that may be used to diagnose apraxia include: Evaluation by a doctor: Your doctor will ask you to do familiar tasks that you’ve learned, such as brushing your teeth or cutting out a shape. An evaluation will also include a physical exam to see if your symptoms are due to problems with your muscles or joints. Your doctor may talk to your family members as well to find out how well you're able to do your normal daily activities. Brain function tests: Your doctor may use neuropsychologic tests to check how your brain is working in areas such as problem-solving, memory, language, attention, and processing. Imaging tests: If your doctor believes your apraxia is caused by damage to your brain, you may have imaging tests such as a CT scan or MRI to find the extent and location of the damage."", ""Your doctor may look for other symptoms too. For instance, they may check for muscle weakness or difficulties with language comprehension. This helps them determine whether you might have another condition instead of apraxia. Diagnosing childhood apraxia of speech There's no single test or procedure that is used to diagnose childhood apraxia of speech. Diagnosis is complicated by the fact that speech-language pathologists have different opinions about which symptoms indicate the condition."", ""Most experts, though, look for multiple, common symptoms. They may assess your child’s ability to repeat a word multiple times. Or they may see if your child can recite a list of words that are increasingly more difficult, such as “play, playful, playfully.” A speech-language pathologist may interact with your child to determine which sounds, syllables, and words they're able to make and understand. The pathologist will also examine your child's\xa0mouth, tongue, and face for any structural problems that might be causing symptoms. Usually, a diagnosis can't be made before your child's second birthday. Before this time, most kids are unable to understand or perform the tasks needed to determine whether they have apraxia."", ""Apraxia Treatments There's no particular treatment for apraxia, and it can’t be cured. But it can be managed with physical, speech, and/or occupational therapy. These therapies can improve your symptoms and make apraxia easier to live with. If another condition is causing your apraxia, you'll get treatment for that condition. In some cases of acquired apraxia, the condition goes away on its own. But that's not the case with childhood apraxia of speech, which doesn't improve without speech-language therapy . Most children with apraxia of speech benefit from seeing a speech-language pathologist three to five times a week. Your child may also work with you to practice the skills they're developing. For the best results, the treatment should be designed to meet your child’s particular needs. Therapy for childhood apraxia of speech aims to improve speech coordination. Apraxia speech therapy activities may include: Repeatedly practicing forming and pronouncing sounds and words Practicing stringing together sounds to make speech Working with rhythms or melodies Using multisensory approaches, such as watching in a mirror while trying to form words or touching the face while talking If your child’s apraxia of speech is serious, they can also learn alternative ways to communicate, such as writing, drawing, or pointing. Another option is to use assistive electronic devices, including computers that can produce words and sentences."", ""Many therapists believe sign language is helpful for children who have trouble being understood. They often recommend that children try to say the words they're signing, helping them practice making mouth movements. People with more serious cases of acquired apraxia may also benefit from sign language or computers. Very few studies have been done to determine how effective different treatments for childhood apraxia of speech are. This may be due, in part, to disagreement among experts about which symptoms should lead to a diagnosis of apraxia."", ""Takeaways When you have apraxia, you have a hard time making certain movements.

In the case of illness or injury, the person's skin may change color, becoming darker (hyperpigmentation) or lighter (hypopigmentation)."", ""Hyperpigmentation and Skin Hyperpigmentation in skin is caused by an increase in melanin, the substance in the body that is responsible for color (pigment). Certain conditions, such as pregnancy or Addison's disease (decreased function of the adrenal gland), may cause a greater production of melanin and hyperpigmentation. Exposure to sunlight is a major cause of hyperpigmentation, and will darken already hyperpigmented areas. Hyperpigmentation can also be caused by various drugs, including some antibiotics , antiarrhythmics, and antimalarial drugs."", 'Melasma An example of hyperpigmentation is melasma.\xa0This condition is characterized by tan or brown patches, most commonly on the face. Melasma can occur in pregnant women and is often called the ""mask of pregnancy;"" however, men can also develop this condition. Melasma sometimes goes away after pregnancy. It can also be treated with certain prescription creams (such as hydroquinone ). Melasma is often seen in women, but men can get it, too. Sunblock, either with clothing or strong sunscreen, can help.', 'If you have melasma, try to limit your exposure to daylight. Wear a broad-brimmed hat and use a sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher at all times, because sunlight will worsen your condition. Sunscreens containing the physical blockers zinc oxide or titanium dioxide are also helpful in blocking daylight’s UVA rays, which makes hyperpigmentation worse. People with darker skin are at higher risk for melasma. It will look like dark brown or greyish brown patches on darker skin. Consult with your doctor before treating the condition yourself.', ""Hypopigmentation and Skin Hypopigmentation in skin is the result of a reduction in melanin production. Examples of hypopigmentation include: Vitiligo : Vitiligo causes smooth, white patches on the skin. In some people, these patches can appear all over the body. It is an autoimmune disorder in which the pigment-producing cells are damaged. There is no cure for vitiligo, but there are several treatments, including cosmetic cover-ups, corticosteroid creams, calcineurin inhibitors ( Elidel cream , Protopic ointment ) or ultraviolet light treatments. The Janus Kinase inhibitor ruxolitinib \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b ( Opzelura ) has been approved for the treatment of nonsegmental vitiligo in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older. Albinism : Albinism is a rare inherited disorder caused by the absence of an enzyme that produces melanin. This results in a complete lack of pigmentation in skin, hair , and eyes . Albinos have an abnormal gene that restricts the body from producing melanin. There is no cure for albinism. People with albinism should use a sunscreen at all times because they are much more likely to get sun damage and skin cancer. This disorder can occur in any race, but is most common among whites. Pigmentation loss as a result of skin damage: If you've had a skin infection, blisters , burns, or other trauma to your skin, you may have a loss of pigmentation in the affected area. The good news with this type of pigment loss is that it's frequently not permanent, but it may take a long time to re-pigment.

Some researchers think it can be tied to your genes. Other times, it happens because of damage to a string of nerves (called a pathway) that helps control your eyes , heart rate , sweat, and blood pressure . One of three pathways may be involved in Horner syndrome: First order (central) This pathway involves the nerves that run from the hypothalamus in your brain to your chest, through your brain stem and spinal cord. Conditions that can affect it include: Sudden loss of blood to your brain stem Tumors on your hypothalamus Spinal cord lesions Stroke Damage to myelin (a thin sheath around your nerves)', ""Second order (preganglionic) These nerves go from your chest to the top of your lungs and along the carotid artery in your neck.

9,Amyloidosis,"['Amyloidosis is when an abnormal protein called amyloid builds up in your tissues and organs. When it does, it affects their shape and how they work. Amyloidosis is a serious health problem that can lead to life-threatening organ failure.', 'Causes and Types of Amyloidosis Many different proteins can lead to amyloid deposits, but only a few have been linked to major health problems. The type of protein and where it collects tells the type of amyloidosis you have. Amyloid deposits may collect throughout your body or in just one area. The different types of amyloidosis include: AL amyloidosis (immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis). This is the most common type and used to be called primary amyloidosis. AL stands for “amyloid light chains,” which is the type of protein responsible for the condition. There’s no known cause, but it happens when your bone marrow makes abnormal antibodies that can’t be broken down. It’s linked with a blood cancer called multiple myeloma. It can affect your kidneys, heart, liver, intestines, and nerves.', ""AA amyloidosis. Previously known as secondary amyloidosis, this condition is the result of another chronic infectious or inflammatory disease such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn’s disease, or ulcerative colitis. It mostly affects your kidneys, but it can also affect your digestive tract, liver, and heart. AA means the amyloid type A protein causes this type. Dialysis-related amyloidosis (DRA). This is more common in older adults and people who have been on dialysis for more than 5 years. This form of amyloidosis is caused by deposits of beta-2 microglobulin that build up in the blood. Deposits can build up in many different tissues, but it most commonly affects bones, joints, and tendons. Familial, or hereditary, amyloidosis. This is a rare form passed down through families. It often affects the liver, nerves, heart, and kidneys. Many genetic defects are linked to a higher chance of amyloid disease. For example, an abnormal protein like transthyretin (TTR) is usually the cause. Age-related (senile) systemic amyloidosis. This is caused by deposits of normal TTR in the heart and other tissues. It happens most commonly in older men. Organ-specific amyloidosis. This causes deposits of amyloid protein in single organs, including the skin (cutaneous amyloidosis). Though some types of amyloid deposits have been linked to Alzheimer's disease, the brain is rarely affected by amyloidosis that happens throughout your body."", 'Risk Factors for Amyloidosis Men get amyloidosis more often than women. Your risk for amyloidosis goes up as you grow older. Amyloidosis affects 15% of patients with a form of cancer called multiple myeloma. Amyloidosis may also happen in people with end-stage kidney disease who are on dialysis for a long time (see ""Dialysis-related amyloidosis"" above).', 'Symptoms of Amyloidosis Symptoms of amyloidosis are often subtle. They can also vary greatly depending on where the amyloid protein is collecting in the body. It is important to note that the symptoms described below may be due to a variety of health problems. Only your doctor can make a diagnosis of amyloidosis. General symptoms of amyloidosis may include: Changes in skin color Severe fatigue Feeling of fullness Joint pain Low red blood cell count (anemia) Shortness of breath Swelling of the tongue Tingling and numbness in legs and feet Weak hand grip Severe weakness Sudden weight loss', 'Cardiac Amyloidosis (Stiff Heart Syndrome) This condition can cause less blood to flow to your heart muscle. Eventually, your heart will no longer be able to pump normally.', ""Some doctors also call cardiac amyloidosis “stiff heart syndrome.” Others say a stiff heart is actually a symptom of cardiac amyloidosis. Either way, amyloid deposits in your heart can make the muscular walls of your heart stiff. They can also make your heart muscle weaker and affect the electrical rhythm of the heart. Stiff heart syndrome can be serious. It may lead to congestive heart failure if it's not successfully treated. Who’s at risk? Cardiac amyloidosis is more common in men than in women. It’s also more likely to affect older people. People under 40 rarely get the condition. You can inherit stiff heart syndrome. Other things that raise your chances of getting it are: Having untreated high blood pressure Being obese Being over 60 Having gone through menopause What are the symptoms? If amyloidosis affects your heart, some symptoms you might notice are: Shortness of breath when you're doing light activity or lying down An irregular heartbeat Signs of heart failure, including swelling of the feet and ankles, weakness, fatigue, and nausea, among others"", ""These can be signs of other health conditions, too. So see your doctor to figure out what’s going on. How is it diagnosed? Your doctor will ask you about your symptoms and whether anyone in your family has cardiac amyloidosis or other heart conditions. They’ll give you a physical exam, too. The doctor may do several tests to diagnose or rule out cardiac amyloidosis, like: Blood and urine tests Imaging tests to see inside your body, like ultrasound, echocardiogram, electrocardiogram, MRI, or CT scan Biopsy Genetic testing, if cardiac amyloidosis runs in your family What are the treatments? There’s more than one type of cardiac amyloidosis. Your treatment will depend on the type you have. Among the options your doctor might recommend are: Medications, including chemotherapy and immunotherapy A pacemaker A stem cell transplant While some of these treatments, like chemo and immunotherapy, are also used to treat cancer, cardiac amyloidosis isn't cancer. It's a disease that affects the heart muscle. There's no cure, but there are treatments for most types of cardiac amyloidosis. Getting an early diagnosis is important since treatment can prevent permanent damage."", 'Renal (Kidney) Amyloidosis Your kidneys filter waste and toxins from your blood. Amyloid deposits in the kidneys make it hard for them to do this job. When your kidneys do not work properly, water and dangerous toxins build up in your body. If amyloidosis affects the kidneys, you may have: Signs of kidney failure, including swelling of the feet and ankles and puffiness around the eyes High levels of protein in your urine', 'Gastrointestinal Amyloidosis Amyloid deposits along your gastrointestinal (GI) tract slow down the movement of food through your intestines. This interferes with digestion. If amyloidosis affects your GI tract, you may have: Less appetite Diarrhea Nausea Stomach pain Weight loss If your liver is affected, that can cause liver enlargement and fluid buildup in the body.', ""Amyloid Neuropathy Amyloid deposits can damage the nerves outside your brain and spinal cord, called the peripheral nerves. The peripheral nerves carry information between your brain and spinal cord and the rest of your body. For example, they make your brain perceive pain if you burn your hand or stub your toes. If amyloidosis affects your nerves, you may have: Balance problems Problems controlling your bladder and bowel Sweating problems Tingling and weakness Lightheadedness when standing due to a problem with your body's ability to control blood pressure"", ""Diagnosing Amyloidosis A thorough physical exam and a detailed and accurate account of your medical history are crucial in helping your doctor diagnose amyloidosis. Blood and urine tests can spot abnormal proteins. Depending on your symptoms, your doctor may also check your thyroid and liver. Your doctor will do a biopsy to confirm a diagnosis of amyloidosis and know the specific type of protein you have. The tissue sample for the biopsy may be taken from your belly fat (the abdominal fat pad), bone marrow, or sometimes your mouth, rectum, or other organs. It's not always necessary to biopsy the part of the body damaged by the amyloid deposits. Imaging tests can also help. They show the amount of damage to organs like your heart, liver, or spleen. Your doctor will do a genetic test if they think you have a type that is passed down through families. Treatment for hereditary amyloidosis is different from treatment for other types of the disease. Once you’re diagnosed, your doctor might check your heart with an echocardiogram or your liver and spleen with imaging tests."", 'Amyloidosis Treatment There is no cure for amyloidosis. Your doctor will prescribe treatments to slow the development of the amyloid protein and manage your symptoms. If amyloidosis is related to another condition, then treatment will include targeting that underlying condition. Specific treatment depends on what type of amyloidosis you have and how many organs are affected. High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant can help remove the substance that leads to amyloid formation in some people with primary AL amyloidosis. Chemotherapy medicines alone may be used to treat other patients with primary AL amyloidosis. Secondary (AA) amyloidosis is treated by controlling the underlying disorder and with powerful anti-inflammatory medicines called steroids, which fight inflammation. A liver transplant may treat\xa0the disease if you have certain types of hereditary amyloidosis. New therapies can slow the production of the abnormal protein TTR. Your doctor might also recommend a kidney transplant. Other treatments to help with symptoms include: Diuretic medicine to remove extra water from your body Thickeners to add to fluids to prevent choking if you have trouble swallowing Compression stockings to relieve swelling in your legs or feet Changes to what you eat, especially if you have gastrointestinal amyloidosis', 'What to Expect Amyloidosis can be deadly, especially if it affects your heart or kidneys. Early diagnosis and treatment are important and can help improve survival. Researchers continue to question why some types of amyloid make people sick and how the formation of amyloid can be stopped. Studies to find new treatments are ongoing. If you have amyloidosis, consider asking your doctor if there are any clinical trials you can join, or search for one by visiting www.clinicaltrials.gov and typing in the search term ""amyloidosis.""']"
10,What Is Olecranon Bursitis?,"['If you’ve had a bad blow to one of your elbows or spend a lot of time leaning on them, you could see the tip of the joint get red and swollen. In severe cases of swelling, a lump could form, jutting out from the tip -- kind of like the cartoon character Popeye. That’s why olecranon bursitis is sometimes called “Popeye’s elbow .” “Olecranon” refers to the pointy bone in your elbow. “Bursitis” refers to inflammation of a part of your body called a bursa. A bursa is a sac full of fluid. Bursa occur throughout your body, acting as cushions between body parts, such as where muscles and tendons glide over bones and near large joints such as your shoulders, hips, and knees. The bursa in your elbow, called the olecranon bursa, reduces friction between the skin and the pointy bone in your elbow, which you can feel when you bend it. You don’t notice the bursa because it usually lies flat, conforming to the shape of your bone. But when it gets irritated, the bursa can get swollen and large.', 'Causes Your elbow can start swelling for several reasons: Trauma: A hard blow to the elbow such as hitting it or falling on top of it could cause the bursa to swell. Too much pressure: Leaning your elbow against a hard surface over a long time can irritate the bursa. Plumbers, air-conditioning technicians, and others who have to work on their elbows are more likely to get this. Other conditions: If you have another condition such as rheumatoid arthritis (a disease where your immune system attacks your joints), gout (a type of arthritis ), or kidney failure in which you need dialysis (your blood is filtered through a machine), you have a higher chance of getting Popeye’s elbow. Infection: If your bursa is infected from a cut, scrape, or insect bite, this will cause the sac to fill up with extra fluid, swell, and get red.', 'Symptoms You may see some of these symptoms when you have elbow bursitis:', 'Swelling: This is usually the first symptom you’ll notice. The skin on the back of the elbow may be loose, so you may not see the swelling at first. In some cases, the swelling flares up quickly and you might notice it right away. As the swelling gets bigger, it can look like a golf ball at the tip of your elbow.', 'Pain : As the bursa stretches, this can start causing pain in your elbows, especially when you bend them. There is usually no pain when the elbow is extended. But some people with elbow bursitis don’t feel any pain whether their elbows are flexed or not. Redness or warmth: If you see this in the area around your elbow, you might have an infected bursa. Tenderness: Another sign is sensitivity in and around the elbow. Pus: Watch for a yellow or white, thick, cloudy fluid draining from an infected bursa. Diagnosis Discuss your symptoms and medical history with your doctor. Your doctor will examine your arm and elbow. In some cases, they may suggest an X-ray, which looks to see whether a broken bone or a piece of bony growth (called a bone spur ) is causing your elbow to swell. Bone spurs on the tip of the elbow bone could repeatedly cause you to have elbow bursitis. They could also order a blood test to see whether you have an infection, but this is not usually very helpful. Your doctor may take a sample of the fluid from your bursa. This will be done using a needle. The fluid sample is taken to the lab for further testing. If the fluid is pus, this means you have an infection.', 'Treatments Treatment is about easing your discomfort and taking steps to prevent or cure infection. If your elbow bursa is not infected, take the following steps: Protect your elbow. This could mean wearing elbow pads or a wrap to cushion it. Avoid activities that put direct pressure on your affected elbow. Take pain medicine such as ibuprofen or other anti-inflammatories to reduce the swelling and the pain. Follow your doctor’s directions and read the medicine label carefully.', 'If you have elbow bursitis because of an infection, you may have to take antibiotics that your doctor prescribes. Take the medication as directed to fight the infection. If you don’t see improvements in pain and swelling in your elbow after taking these steps for 3 to 4 weeks, let your doctor know. They may suggest draining the fluid from your bursa and injecting a medicine to reduce the swelling. An injection of corticosteroid, a medication commonly used to reduce inflammation and redness, may be used to lessen the pain and swelling.', 'If your elbow bursitis isn’t getting better despite medicine and treatment, your doctor may recommend surgery. Depending on your case, the entire bursa may be removed. You’ll most likely stay overnight in the hospital to have this done. The bursa usually grows back normally after several months. You typically need about 3 to 4 weeks to regain full use of your elbow after surgery.', '']"
11,Oophorectomy,"['What Is an Oophorectomy? An oophorectomy is surgery to remove your ovaries . You might also hear it called ovary removal surgery.', 'Reasons for Oophorectomy There are many reasons your doctor may recommend surgery to remove your ovaries. They include: Benign tumors , which are noncancerous growths BRCA gene mutations, which are changes in your DNA that make you more likely to have breast or ovarian cancer Cysts, a type of noncancerous tumor Ectopic pregnancy Endometriosis , a condition where cells that normally grow inside your uterus start growing elsewhere Ovarian cancer , which is a cancer that starts in your ovaries PID, which is when you get an infection in your ovaries or around them (It’s also called pelvic inflammatory disease or a tubo-ovarian abscess .) Torsion of the ovary, a condition where your ovary twists around its stalk, where the blood supply is. This might cause you serious pain . Treat pelvic pain: It can treat chronic pelvic pain , or pain after an ovary-sparing hysterectomy .', 'Oophorectomy Procedure There are several types of oophorectomies. The one you’ll get depends on the medical condition you’re being treated for: Unilateral oophorectomy: Remove one ovary Bilateral oophorectomy: Remove both ovaries Salpingo-oophorectomy: Remove an ovary and fallopian tube (the small organ that guides eggs from your ovary to your uterus) Bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy: Remove both ovaries and both fallopian tubes Hysterectomy with salpingo-oophorectomy: Remove your uterus and one or both ovaries and fallopian tubes Usually, you’ll get general anesthesia for surgery and won’t be awake. But in some cases, you may have local anesthesia instead. That means the doctor only numbs the area they’re working on. There are a few ways the surgery can be done. Your doctor will suggest the method based on your particular situation: An open procedure: This is the traditional way to perform the surgery. Your doctor will make one large incision, or cut, in your belly. This lets them see your ovaries, separate each one from other tissues and arteries that supply blood , and then remove them. Laparoscopic surgery: Your surgeon will insert a small camera, called a laparoscope, through a tiny cut in your bellybutton. It lets them see your ovaries. The camera sends images to a monitor, just like a TV or computer screen. The doctor will make other small cuts in your belly, as needed, using special surgical tools. They’ll remove the ovaries through a small cut in your belly or vagina . In some cases, the doctor may start to remove your ovaries this way but change to an open procedure once they see what’s happening inside. Vaginal approach: This is usually done when you’re also getting your uterus removed (hysterectomy). You have a smaller chance of getting an infection with this type, and you might even recover faster. Laparotomy: The doctor will make a large cut on your belly to remove your ovaries. Although your chance of getting an infection is low for any surgery, it’s higher with a laparotomy and it’ll take longer to recover with this method. Robotic-assisted ovary removal: Your doctor makes several small incisions to put the robot’s camera and specialized instruments in place. Guided by the camera, your doctor controls the robotic device and uses the special tools on its arms to remove your ovaries.', 'Oophorectomy Hospital Stay If your doctor performs an open procedure to remove your ovaries, you can expect to stay in the hospital several days. If you have a laparoscopic or robot-assisted operation, you may stay in the hospital for a day or be released the same day.', 'Oophorectomy Recovery The doctor will give you instructions about your return to an active lifestyle. Things you can do to take care of yourself at home include: Keeping the area where the doctor made the cut clean and sterile Eating plenty of healthy food Not driving Not exercising (but walking around is OK) Not lifting heavy things Taking it easy at work, at home, and at school Taking the pain medication your doctor suggests How quickly you can return to normal activities depends on your overall health before surgery, the reason for your surgery, and the way your surgery was done. Most women get back to an active life within 6 weeks of surgery. Women who had laparoscopic surgery or robot-assisted surgery tend to have quicker recoveries -- about 2 weeks.', 'While you recover, look out for signs that you may need to see the doctor. Some things to watch out for include: Blood or liquid coming out of the cut Feeling nauseated or throwing up A fever over 100.4 F Trouble peeing Serious pain Swelling or redness around the cut Vaginal discharge (You might feel itchy or notice a bad smell.)', 'Risks of Oophorectomy Although getting an oophorectomy is generally safe, as with any surgery, there are a few risks. They include: Bleeding: If you bleed too much during surgery, you may need blood transfusions. Damage to nearby organs: Surgery could damage your bladder or bowel, but this is rare. It happens in less than 1% of all cases. Infection: You could get one several days, or even several weeks, after surgery. It could cause a fever or redness and pain near the cut. Hernia : Sometimes the muscle near the cut gets weak. Tumor rupture: Your tumor could burst, spreading cancerous cells into your body. Retention of ovary cells: Your ovary cells could keep causing problems, like pain near your pelvis. Loss of fertility : If both ovaries are removed, you’ll need a treatment like in vitro fertilization (IVF) to get pregnant . The doctor will discuss these risks with you before your surgery. If they advise you to have this surgery, it means they think the benefits outweigh the risks for you.', 'Fertility and Menopause After Oophorectomy This can cause menopause symptoms like: Hot flashes Vaginal dryness A higher risk of osteoporosis Anxiety or depression Heart disease Problems with memory Lowered sex drive Your doctor may recommend low-dose hormone therapy , or other medications and lifestyle changes, to help you with the symptoms. Younger women may have concerns about whether they can get pregnant . It will depend on your situation. If the doctor removes only one ovary, the remaining ovary will probably still produce estrogen . That means you’ll still have a menstrual cycle and be able to get pregnant. If they remove both ovaries, you may need a treatment like in vitro fertilization to get pregnant. Sometimes, eggs can be removed from your ovaries before surgery and frozen for future use. Talk to your doctor about your options.']"
12,What Opportunistic Infections Do You Get With HIV?,"['If you have HIV, treating it early with antiretroviral medicines will help your immune system and allow you to stay in good health.\xa0But untreated HIV, over the course of years, will harm your immune system and can lead to opportunistic infections.\xa0""Opportunistic"" means they take advantage of the weaker immune system of someone with HIV. People with healthy immune systems aren\'t bothered by them. HIV attacks CD4 cells, which find and destroy bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other germs. Without enough CD4 cells to fight them off, infections can lead to illnesses, cancers, and brain and nerve problems. Certain opportunistic infections are signs that your HIV has become AIDS. If your CD4 count stays up, opportunistic infections are less likely to be a problem. This is why you must continue to take your HIV medicines. If your CD4 count is low, your doctor may want you to take preventive drugs in addition to your antiretroviral medicines to lessen your chances of getting sick. If you do get sick, you can take medicines to help your body fight some of these infections.', ""Common Opportunistic Infections Almost any disease can become an opportunistic infection when your immune system is weak. Some are more common than others, and depending on your CD4 count, some are more likely to occur. Candidiasis\xa0or thrush, a fungal infection in your mouth, throat, or vagina Cryptococcus neoformans\xa0(crypto), a fungus that can lead to meningitis, a serious inflammation of the membranes that surround your brain and spinal cord Cryptosporidiosis\xa0and\xa0microsporidiosis, infections of microscopic animals called protozoa that mess up your gut Cytomegalovirus\xa0(CMV), a virus that causes eye disease and can lead to blindness. It can also cause severe diarrhea and ulcers. Herpes simplex, a group of viruses that cause sores around your mouth (cold sores) and on your genitals Mycobacterium avium complex\xa0(MAC), bacteria that cause fevers, problems with digestion, and serious weight loss Pneumocystis pneumonia\xa0(PCP), a fungus that causes a deadly lung infection Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a virus that affects your brain Toxoplasmosis, a disease caused by a parasite that can lead to encephalitis, which is an inflammation of the brain, as well as blurry vision and eye damage Tuberculosis (TB), a bacterial infection that attacks your lungs. It can also invade other organs and lead to meningitis. Men are three times more likely than women to develop a cancer called Kaposi's sarcoma. Women have a greater chance of getting certain infections like HPV that can lead to cancers of the reproductive system such as cervical cancer."", ""Prevention The most important way to prevent opportunistic infections is to take your HIV medicines and keep your CD4 count from becoming low.\xa0 If you are starting with a low CD4 count (less than 200 cells per microliter of blood), you can take steps to lower your chances of getting these infections. Take your HIV medicines and see your doctor regularly to make sure that they are working and that your immune system remains strong.\xa0 Take other medicines and get vaccinated as recommended by your doctor. Wash and cook all of your food well. Avoid raw or undercooked meats and eggs, and unpasteurized dairy. Thoroughly clean and disinfect your hands, knives, cutting boards, and counters where you make food. Have someone else handle cat litter or pick up dog waste, or use gloves if you do. Keep cats indoors so they don't bring in germs that could harm you. Use a towel on shared gym equipment and a different towel to dry yourself. Try not to swallow water in pools, lakes, or streams. If you're a woman, get regular pelvic exams and Pap tests to spot infections, precancers, and cancers."", ""Diagnosis and Treatment You can get lab tests to find out which germs are already in your body. This will help your doctor know\xa0what medicines or vaccines you need in addition to your HIV drugs. If you have a low CD4 count, keep a record of your symptoms, and pay attention to: Fever for more than 2 days Bad diarrhea Difficulty breathing Weight loss A change in vision Problems with your mouth, skin, or breathing Call your doctor when you have new or unusual symptoms. Don't wait for your next scheduled\xa0visit. Because the HIV virus makes copies of itself more quickly when you have an opportunistic infection, early treatment is important. It will help you avoid the serious consequences of infection as well as preserve your immune system. Follow through with all of the treatment. Don't quit early. Your doctor might also prescribe medication to prevent the infection from coming back, and if your immune system recovers, you may be able to stop taking that.""]"
13,What Is Neuromyelitis Optica?,"[""Neuromyelitis optica, or NMO, \xa0is also called neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) and Devic disease. It is a disease that affects your eyes and spinal cord. It's not very common -- only about 4,000 people in the United States have it. NMO happens because your body's immune system attacks healthy cells in your central nervous system (your brain and your spinal cord). These attacks can happen over days or weeks -- this is called monophasic NMO. Or you may go a long time between attacks, even months or years. This is called relapsing NMO. With relapsing NMO, symptoms go away but can come back and get worse over time. Men and women are equally likely to get the monophasic type, but women get relapsing NMO much more often than men. Children also can get the disease."", 'Symptoms The signs of NMO fall into two categories. See your doctor if you have any of these symptoms: Optic neuritis : inflammation of the optic nerve (this carries information from your eye to your brain ). You might feel sudden pain inside your eye. That can be followed by problems like not seeing clearly or even blindness. It usually happens only in one eye , but it can happen in both. Transverse myelitis : inflammation of the spinal cord. This can cause problems with your arms and legs, including pain, weakness, numbness, or paralysis. It also can lead to loss of control of your bladder and bowel. You could have nausea , vomiting , hiccups, a stiff neck , or a headache . Children who have NMO may seem confused, have seizures , or fall into a coma .', ""NMO Is Not MS Another condition that also causes inflammation and can make it hard to move is multiple sclerosis (MS). Doctors used to think NMO was a type of MS. Now research shows they're different: MS usually happens more slowly and over a longer time. There is a blood test for NMO, but there is no blood test for MS. An MRI of the brain usually looks normal when you first get NMO but not with MS. With NMO, you might have nausea, vomiting, and hiccups. This doesn't usually happen with MS."", ""Cause Doctors aren't sure what causes NMO. It doesn't seem to run in families, but many people who have it also have other autoimmune diseases , in which your body mistakenly attacks healthy cells. Or they may have family members who have them. Some examples of autoimmune diseases are type 1 diabetes , rheumatoid arthritis , psoriasis , and vitiligo ."", 'Diagnosis Your doctor will examine you and check your thinking, vision , speech, strength, and reflexes. They may want to test fluid from your spine and your blood. More than 70% of people who have NMO have a certain protein in their blood called an antibody.', ""Your doctor also may want to look at your spine to see if it's inflamed. One way to do that is with a test called an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). It uses a large magnet and a computer to create an image of your spinal cord. You also might need to see a doctor who specializes in treating eyes ( ophthalmologist ) and have an optical coherence tomography (OCT) to check for damage to the optic nerve."", ""Treatment There's no cure for NMO,\xa0but there are medicines and other treatments that can help ease your symptoms, including: Drugs to prevent attacks. The\xa0FDA has recently approved three drugs to treat it. Eculizumab ( Soliris ), inebilizumab-cdon ( Uplizna ), and satralizumab-mwge ( Enspryng ) work by targeting the defective antibodies that attack the healthy cells in your body, triggering NMO. Your doctor may prescribe you other drugs to suppress your immune system. Steroids. Your doctor will likely give you steroids or corticosteroids that help with inflammation. Other drugs may help keep your body from fighting off the good cells and prevent future attacks. You'll get them into a vein in your arm through an IV. Plasma exchange . Called plasmapheresis ., this removes harmful antibodies from the blood. A machine separates the different parts of your blood, then your plasma is replaced with a substitute. After that, the new blood is put back into your body.""]"
14,"Oral Cancer: Risks, Symptoms, and Prevention","['Oral cancer appears as a growth or sore in the mouth that does not go away. About 50,000 people in the U.S. get oral cancer each year, 70% of them men. Oral cancer includes cancers of the lips, tongue , cheeks, floor of the mouth , hard and soft palate, sinuses , and pharynx (throat. It can be life-threatening if not diagnosed and treated early. When it is caught early, oral cancer is much easier for doctors to treat. Yet most people get a diagnosis when their condition is too advanced to treat effectively. If you see your dentist or doctor regularly and learn how to spot suspicious changes, you’ll have a much better shot at an early diagnosis.', ""What Are the Symptoms of Oral Cancer? The most common symptoms of oral cancer include: Swellings/thickenings, lumps or bumps, rough spots/crusts/or eroded areas on the lips, gums, cheek, or other areas inside the mouth Velvety white, red, or speckled (white and red) patches in the mouth $('.ua_type_mobile .article table').css('width','100%'); Unexplained bleeding in the mouth Unexplained numbness, loss of feeling, or pain/tenderness in any area of the face, mouth, or neck Persistent sores on the face, neck, or mouth that bleed easily and do not heal within 2 weeks A soreness or feeling that something is caught in the back of the throat Difficulty chewing or swallowing, speaking, or moving the jaw or tongue Hoarseness, chronic sore throat , or change in voice Ear pain Swelling or pain in your jaw.

A change in the way your teeth or dentures fit together Dramatic weight loss If you notice any of these changes, contact your dentist or health care professional immediately."", ""Who Gets Oral Cancer? According to the American Cancer Society, men face twice the risk of developing oral cancer as women. Men who are over age 50 face the greatest risk. It's estimated that over 50,000 people in the U.S. received a diagnosis of oral cancer in 2019."", 'Risk factors for the development of oral cancer include: Smoking. Cigarette, cigar , or pipe smokers are six times more likely than nonsmokers to develop oral cancers. Smokeless tobacco use . Users of dip, snuff, or chewing tobacco products are 50 times more likely to develop cancers of the cheek, gums, and lining of the lips. Excessive consumption of alcohol. Oral cancers are about six times more common in drinkers than in nondrinkers. \xa0Using alcohol and tobacco together increases your chances even more. Family history of cancer. Excessive sun exposure, especially at a young age. Ultraviolet radiation from the sun can cause lip cancers. Human papillomavirus (HPV). Certain HPV strains are etiologic risk factors for Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC). Almost everyone who’s sexually active will get HPV at some point in life. A specific type of this virus is causing a growing number of otherwise healthy men under 50 to get cancers in the back of their mouths and throats from oral sex. The more people you and your partners have sex with, the bigger your risk. Age. Oral cancers can take years to grow. Most people find they have it after age 55. But more younger men are getting cancers linked to HPV. Gender. Men are at least twice as likely as women to get oral cancer . It could be because men drink and smoke more than women do. Poor diet. Studies have found a link between oral cancer and not eating enough vegetables and fruits. It is important to note that over 25% of all oral cancers occur in people who do not smoke and who only drink alcohol occasionally.', 'What Is the Outlook for People With Oral Cancer? The overall 5-year survival rate for patients with an early diagnosis of oral cavity and pharynx cancers is 84%. If the cancer has spread to nearby tissues, organs, or lymph nodes, the 5-year survival rate drops to 65%.', 'How Is Oral Cancer Diagnosed? As part of your routine dental exam, your dentist will conduct an oral cancer screening exam. \xa0Your dentist knows what a healthy mouth should look like and probably has the best chance of spotting any cancer. Experts recommend getting checked every year starting at age 18, and sooner if you start smoking or having sex.', ""More specifically, your dentist will feel for any lumps or irregular tissue changes in your neck, head, face, and oral cavity. When examining your mouth, your dentist will look for any sores or discolored tissue as well as check for any signs and symptoms mentioned above. A biopsy may be needed to determine the makeup of a suspicious-looking area. There are different types of biopsies and your doctor can determine which one is best.\xa0 Many doctors don’t use brush biopsies because while they're very easy, they still need a scalpel biopsy to confirm the results if the brush biopsy is positive.\xa0 Also there are different types of scalpel biopsies, incisional and excisional, depending whether only a piece or the whole area is needed to determine what the nature of the problem is. \xa0Some doctors perform these biopsies with lasers."", 'How Is Oral Cancer Treated? Oral cancer is treated the same way many other cancers are treated -- with surgery to remove the cancerous growth, followed by radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy (drug treatments) to destroy any remaining cancer cells.', ""What Can You Do to Prevent Oral Cancer? Scientists think that oral cancer starts when the DNA in the cells inside your mouth gets damaged. But some things, including your health habits, can make you more likely to get it. To prevent oral cancer: Don't smoke or use any tobacco products and drink alcohol in moderation (and refrain from binge drinking). Eat a well-balanced diet. Limit your exposure to the sun. Repeated exposure increases the risk of cancer on the lip, especially the lower lip. When in the sun, use UV-A/B-blocking sun protective lotions on your skin , as well as your lips. You can take an active role in detecting oral cancer early, should it occur, by doing the following: Conduct a self-exam at least once a month. Using a bright light and a mirror, look and feel your lips and front of your gums. Tilt your head back and look at and feel the roof of your mouth. Pull your checks out to view the inside of your mouth, the lining of your cheeks, and the back gums. Pull out your tongue and look at all surfaces; examine the floor of your mouth. Look at the back of your throat. Feel for lumps or enlarged lymph nodes in both sides of your neck and under your lower jaw. Call your dentist's office immediately if you notice any changes in the appearance of your mouth or any of the signs and symptoms mentioned above. See your dentist on a regular schedule. Even though you may be conducting frequent self-exams, sometimes dangerous spots or sores in the mouth can be very tiny and difficult to see on your own. The American Cancer Society recommends oral cancer screening exams every 3 years for persons over age 20 and annually for those over age 40. During your next dental appointment, ask your dentist to perform an oral exam. Early detection can improve the chance of successful treatment.""]"

If the burning doesn't go away or gets worse, see your dentist or doctor."", 'Causes of Burning Mouth Syndrome Burning mouth syndrome is grouped as primary or secondary, depending on the cause. Primary burning mouth syndrome The burning pain can’t be explained by a lab test or other health condition. You might also hear primary burning mouth syndrome called idiopathic burning mouth syndrome. Doctors think the cause could be damage to nerves that control taste or pain. Secondary burning mouth syndrome Sometimes, burning mouth syndrome results from another health event or condition. In this case, it’s called secondary burning mouth syndrome. Causes of secondary burning mouth syndrome include: Acid reflux (acid from your stomach comes back up into your mouth) Allergic reaction to materials used in dentures Anxiety or depression Changes in hormones due to the thyroid disease, diabetes, or menopause Dry mouth resulting from diseases or treatments; for example, Sjogren’s syndrome and radiation therapy Medications used to treat blood pressure Dentures don’t fit well Lack of iron, vitamin B12, or folic acid Reaction to certain toothpastes or mouthwashes Stress Thrush (a yeast infection in your mouth)', 'Risk Factors for Burning Mouth Syndrome Burning mouth syndrome is more common in women than men.

Any type of chronic pain can lead to anxiety which is known to cause sleeping problems.']"
16,Tardive Dyskinesia,"[""Tardive dyskinesia is a side effect of antipsychotic medications . These drugs are used to treat schizophrenia and other mental health disorders. TD causes stiff, jerky movements of your face and body that you can't control. You might blink your eyes , stick out your tongue , or wave your arms without meaning to do so. Not everyone who takes an antipsychotic drug will get it. But if TD happens, it’s sometimes permanent. So if you have movements you can't control, let your doctor know right away. To ease your symptoms, your doctor may: Lower the dose Add another medication to counteract the movements Switch you to a different drug"", ""Symptoms Tardive dyskinesia causes stiff, jerky movements that you can't control. They include: Orofacial dyskinesia or oro-bucco-lingual dyskinesia : Uncontrolled movements in your face -- namely your lips, jaw, or tongue . You might: Stick out your tongue without trying Blink your eyes fast Chew Smack or pucker your lips Puff out your cheeks Frown Grunt Dyskinesia of the limbs: It can also affect your arms, legs, fingers, and toes. That can cause you to: Wiggle your fingers Tap your feet Flap your arms Thrust out your pelvis Sway from side to side These movements can be fast or slow. You may find it hard to work and stay active."", ""Causes and Risk Factors Antipsychotic meds treat schizophrenia , bipolar disorder , and other brain conditions. Doctors also call them neuroleptic drugs. They block a brain chemical called dopamine. It helps cells talk to each other and makes the muscles move smoothly. When you have too little of it, your movements can become jerky and out of control. You can get TD if you take an antipsychotic drug. Usually you have to be on it for 3 months or more. But there have been rare cases of it after a single dose of an antipsychotic medicine. Older versions of these drugs are more likely to cause this problem than newer ones. Some studies find a similar risk from both types, though. Antipsychotic medications that can cause tardive dyskinesia include antipsychotics like: Haloperidol (Haldol) Fluphenazine Risperidone (Risperdal) Olanzapine (Zyprexa) Your chances of getting TD go up the longer you take an antipsychotic medicine. Some drugs that treat nausea , reflux, and other stomach problems can also cause TD if you take them for more than 3 months. These include: Metoclopramide ( Reglan ) Prochlorperazine ( Compazine ) You're more likely to get it if you: Are a woman who has gone through menopause Are over age 55 Abuse alcohol or drugs Are African American or Asian American"", ""Diagnosis TD can be hard to diagnose. Symptoms might not appear until months or years after you start taking antipsychotic medicine. Or you might first notice the movements after you've already stopped taking the drug. The timing can make it hard to know whether the medicine caused your symptoms. Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS): If you take medicine for mental health conditions, your doctor should check you at least once a year to make sure you don't have TD. They can give you a physical exam called the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale, which will help them rate any abnormal movements. They can also do tests to find out whether you have another disorder that causes abnormal movements, like: Cerebral palsy Huntington's disease Parkinson's disease Stroke Tourette's syndrome To rule out these conditions, you may get: Blood tests Imaging scans of the brain, such as a CT or MRI scan"", 'Treatment and Prevention The goal is to prevent TD. When your doctor prescribes a new drug to treat a mental health disorder, ask about its side effects. The benefits of the drug should outweigh the risks.', ""If you have movement problems, tell your doctor but don't stop taking the drug on your own. Your doctor can take you off the medicine that caused the movements, or lower the dose. You might need to switch to a newer antipsychotic drug that may be less likely to cause TD. There are two FDA-approved medicines to treat tardive dyskinesia: Deutetrabenazine ( Austedo ) Valbenazine ( Ingrezza ) Both of these medicines work in similar ways to regulate the amount of dopamine flow in brain areas that control certain kinds of movements. Both can sometimes cause drowsiness. Austedo also has been shown to sometimes cause depression when used in patients with Huntington's disease. There's no proof that natural remedies can treat it, but some might help with movements: Ginkgo biloba Melatonin Vitamin B6 Vitamin E Talk to your doctor before you take any supplements for your symptoms.""]"
17,What You Need to Know About Organ Transplants,"[""If you need a donor organ, you are probably coping with a lot of emotions. This article will help you understand what to expect. Organ transplantation -- the surgical removal of a healthy organ from one person and its transplantation into another person whose organ has failed or was injured -- is often lifesaving and gives the recipient a wonderful new lease on life. But organ transplantation is also a major surgery that carries potential risks and drawbacks, such as the chance of organ rejection. That's precisely why you and your loved ones need to gather as much information as possible on organ transplants, as soon as possible."", 'Organ Transplants: An Overview In the United States, 9\xa0types of organ transplants are now performed, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), a nonprofit organization in Richmond Va. UNOS administers the country\'s only Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network, which includes the organ transplant waiting list. Organ transplants include kidney , pancreas , liver , heart , lung , and intestine. Vascularized composite allografts (VCAs), are now also possible, including face and hand transplantation. Sometimes, ""double"" transplants are done, such as kidney / pancreas or heart / lung .', 'In 2021, more than 40,000 organ transplants were performed in the U.S.,\xa0according to UNOS. Most recipients are between the ages of 50 and 64. To date, most donor organs have come from deceased donors, but the percentage of living donors\xa0has climbed each year\xa0since 1988. Kidney transplants are the most common type of transplant surgery; the least common single-organ transplants are the intestines . Depending on the organ needed, organs are matched using several characteristics, including blood type and size of the organ needed. Also taken into account is how long someone has been on the waiting list, how sick they are, and the distance between the donor and the potential recipient.', ""You Need an Organ Transplant: What's Next? Once your doctor gives you the news, they will typically refer you to an organ transplant center. You aren't bound to go to the recommended center, says Gigi Spicer, RN, former vice president of transplant services for Tulane Health System in New Orleans. This is the point at which you as a potential transplant recipient have to become very proactive, even if you're still reeling from the news."", 'It\'s a mistake to give up and let your health care team make all the decisions, Spicer says. There are some things you can\'t control, but a surprising amount you can. Start by searching for transplant centers by organ type, and then by state or by region, on the UNOS web page. Click on ""Resources"" and then ""Member Directory."" You can get specific reports on centers nationwide by visiting the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients\xa0website.\xa0Included in the reports are waiting times, number of living vs. deceased donors, survival rates, and other facts. The statistics can get complicated, so you should ask your own doctor or the facility to help you interpret them. It is important, says Spicer, to educate yourself about your disease as much as you can and gather as much information as possible on organ transplants, so that you are an informed patient.', 'Getting on the Organ Transplant Waiting List To get on the national transplant waiting list, UNOS tells potential recipients, contact the transplant hospital you and your doctor have decided on and ask for an appointment. You will be evaluated by the organ transplant team, which will take into account your medical history, current health status, and other variables to see if you are indeed a good candidate for the transplant.', 'Every transplant hospital has its own criteria for evaluation. UNOS has also developed guidelines. If the team accepts you as a candidate, it will add you to the national waiting list maintained by UNOS. To find out if you are on the list, check with your transplant hospital. Written notices about who is on the waiting list are not sent by UNOS. According to UNOS, you may ask to be listed at more than one hospital, but be aware that individual hospitals can have their rules about that; be sure to ask. UNOS keeps a running total of the transplant waiting lists in the entire nation, organ by organ, on its website and updates it regularly. As of\xa0October 2021, about 106,800\xa0people were on the waiting list nationwide for organs of all types.', 'Organ Transplant Waiting Times, Policies, Procedures The average wait time for an organ transplant varies by organ, age, blood type, and other factors. For instance, waiting times can reach seven to 10 years for candidates waiting for deceased kidney organ donors.', 'UNOS has an online database known as UNET, which collects, stores, and analyzes data on the patient waiting list, organ matching, and the transplants. All U.S. organ transplant programs, as well as organ procurement organizations and tissue typing labs, work together to share the organs. The database allows the facilities to register patients, match donated organs to patients on the transplant waiting list, and manage the data of transplant patients before and after the surgery. More than 250 transplant hospitals operate in the U.S. New federal rules that tightened standards for the centers took effect in June 2007. Among other requirements, the centers are now required to perform an average of 10 transplants a year, with some exceptions allowed, to keep federal funding. UNOS distributes the organs first locally. But if no match is found, the organ is offered to a good match regionally and then nationally, if necessary.', 'What Are Your Organ Donor Options? You also may have a choice about whether the organ donor is deceased or living.', 'Living donors are arranged through the individual transplant centers, according to UNOS. Another option, if you need a kidney transplant, is to contact the National Kidney Foundation\'s National Donor Family Council. Your living organ donor can be a spouse or other family member or an unrelated person such as a friend, Spicer says. The potential living donor\'s blood is tested to see if they are\xa0compatible with the recipient. But even if the blood types are not compatible, you may be able to find a program that allows proxy donors. This is when someone who doesn\'t match the intended donor can still donate the organ for someone else\'s use, and the intended donor goes to the top of the transplant list. Another possibility is called paired kidney exchange in which recipients who have donors that are not compatible can enter programs where they are able to ""swap"" donors. Those who need a transplant often ask if they can buy an organ. The answer is simple: No. In the United States, it is a felony to buy an organ. Though other countries allow the sale of organs, a doctor practicing in the U.S. would not place that organ, Spicer says.', ""Gathering Information on Organ Transplants Depending on the organ being transplanted, you can get other help from a variety of organizations. UNOS has on its site an exhaustive list, from national organizations such as the American Heart Association, America Kidney Foundation and American Liver Foundation to state organizations such as the Georgia Transplant Foundation. There's a wide array of information on organ transplants available to you. You can be an integral part of your care by tapping into these resources.""]"
18,Braces,"['What Are Braces? Braces are dental tools that help correct problems with your teeth , like crowding, crooked teeth , or teeth that are out of alignment. Many people get braces when they’re teenagers, but adults get them too. As you wear them, braces slowly straighten and align your teeth so you have a normal bite. Some people get braces to adjust their smile . If you have crooked teeth and/or a misaligned bite (an underbite or overbite), there are a variety of treatments that can help straighten teeth, including braces and retainers, custom-made, removable or fixed tools that cover the outside of your teeth and help keep them in position.\xa0Learn more about how to tell if you have an overbite . Many general dentists do basic alignment and treat other tooth problems, but orthodontists specialize in correcting issues with your teeth.\xa0An orthodontist has 2 to 3 years of advanced orthodontic education and training beyond dental school. They specialize in straightening teeth, correcting misaligned bites, and jaw problems.', 'The dentist or orthodontist you choose will ask questions about your health, do a clinical exam, take a digital scan of your teeth, take photos of your face and teeth, and order X-rays of the mouth and head. They’ll come up with a treatment plan based on this information. You might only need a removable retainer. If you have an extreme overbite or underbite, you could need surgery. But most people need braces.\xa0Learn more: Can your overbite return after you wear braces?', 'Types of Braces Braces are the most popular way to straighten teeth and correct misaligned bites in children. They’re not the shiny mouthful of metal of years past. Many more options are now available. If braces are indeed the solution for you, the dentist or orthodontist will prescribe an appliance specific for your needs. The braces may consist of bands, wires, and other fixed or removable corrective appliances. No one method works for everyone. Metal/traditional braces: Traditional braces are made of metal. They include brackets that are attached to the front of your teeth or bands that fit around each tooth, as well as flexible wires or archwires that hold the brackets or bands together. Some braces also include rubber bands or metal ties that link the brackets to the wire. These bands create more pressure to help straighten and align your teeth. Sometimes, your orthodontist will have you wear a device called headgear at night. It provides added pressure to help straighten your teeth. You can put it on and take it off. Ceramic braces: The brackets in traditional braces are now also made in tooth-colored ceramic, so you don’t notice them as much. They can also be made with stainless steel, clear materials, or gold. Lingual braces: The brackets on these braces are attached to the backs of your teeth, facing your tongue . Lingual braces are harder to see. Clear aligners : You might also hear them called invisible braces. These are clear plastic trays that fit snugly onto your teeth. They use pressure to gently move your teeth into the correct positions and straighten your smile. You remove the aligners to eat, brush, or floss, but you should keep them in at least 22 hours each day for them to work. The orthodontist may also place tooth-colored attachments onto your teeth to hold the aligners in place.\xa0Find more information on dental aligners and how to straighten teeth at home .', 'How Do Braces Work? Braces work by putting pressure on your teeth over a period of time to slowly move them in a specific direction. The bone under them changes shape, too. Braces are made up of these things: Brackets are the small squares that go on the front of each tooth. The dentist uses a special bonding agent or attaches them with orthodontic bands. Brackets act like handles, holding the arch wires that move your teeth. There are several types of brackets, including stainless steel and tooth-colored ceramic or plastic. Dentists use these a lot because they’re harder to see. Sometimes the dentist will cement brackets to the backs of your teeth, in order to hide them from view. Orthodontic bands are stainless steel, clear, or tooth-colored materials cemented to your teeth. They wrap around each tooth to provide an anchor for the brackets. The clear or tooth-colored bands look better, but they also cost more than stainless steel. Not everyone gets bands. Some people have only brackets and no bands. Spacers fit between your teeth to create a small space for the orthodontic bands. Arch wires attach to the brackets and act as tracks to guide the movement of your teeth. Some archwires are made of metal. Others are clear or tooth-colored. Ties are small rubber rings or fine wires that fasten the arch wire to the brackets. They can be clear, metal, or colored. A buccal tube on the band of the last tooth holds the end of the arch wire securely in place. Tiny elastic rubber bands, called ligatures, hold the arch wires to the brackets. The orthodontist may place springs on the arch wires between brackets to push, pull, open, or close the spaces between your teeth. Elastics or rubber bands attach to hooks on the brackets. They go between your upper and lower teeth in various ways. They use pressure to move your upper teeth against the lower teeth to get a perfect fit. You can choose your favorite color. Many kids choose their school colors or decorate their mouth during holidays (for example, orange and black for Halloween). Some people need headgear, a wire gadget that moves your upper molars farther back in the mouth to correct bite problems or make more room for crowded teeth. The orthodontist will add headgear tubes to two bands on your upper teeth to hold the facebow part of your headgear in place. The rest of this horseshoe-shaped piece surrounds your face and connects to a strap at the back of your head. If headgear is needed, it usually has to be worn only while sleeping or at home. Newer “mini-braces,” which are much smaller than traditional braces, may be an option for some. Another method of straightening teeth uses removable plastic retainers. This may also work if your teeth aren’t too crowded. Your orthodontist will discuss the various types of braces with you and figure out which option is best.\xa0Find more information on buying retainers online .', 'How Long Will I Have to Wear Braces? The time required for braces varies from person to person. It depends on: How severe your problem is The amount of room inside your mouth The distance your teeth must travel The health of the teeth, gums, and supporting bone How closely you follow instructions On average, once braces go on, they usually remain in place for 1 to 3 years. After braces come off, most people need to wear a retainer all the time for the first 6 months. After that, you have to wear it only while you’re asleep, but you may do it for many years.', 'Braces Treatment The orthodontist will want to see you about every month or so in order to make sure the braces are putting steady pressure on your teeth. They’ll adjust the wires, springs, or rubber bands to create more tension and pressure. In some cases, braces alone won’t be enough to straighten your teeth or shift your jaw. That’s when the orthodontist will suggest headgear.', 'Will Braces Be Painful? There may be some discomfort when braces are put on, when they are adjusted, or when you start using a new appliance, such as rubber bands or headgear. Over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help. Tell your orthodontist if you have a lot of pain after each adjustment. They may be able to make the adjustments a bit differently or provide special wax to cover the sharp areas on the braces.', 'Can You Be Allergic to Braces? Some people are allergic to certain metals, such as nickel. When this happens, other materials can be used instead. People can also be allergic to the latex gloves used by the orthodontist and the assistants. Braces can sometimes irritate gums, causing swelling. This is not an allergic reaction but is still something to watch for.', ""Caring for Teeth With Braces and Retainers Braces, wires, springs, rubber bands, and other appliances can attract food and plaque, which can stain teeth if not brushed away. Most orthodontists recommend brushing after every meal or snack with fluoride toothpaste and carefully removing any food that may have gotten stuck in your braces. Some orthodontists will also prescribe or recommend a fluoride mouthwash, which can get into places in the mouth that a toothbrush can't reach. A Waterpik or AirFlosser is also sometimes helpful to flush out stuck food."", 'To floss teeth if you have braces, feed the short end of the floss through the space between the main arch wire and the upper portion of the tooth closest to the gum. Use a gentle sawing motion to work the floss on each side of the two teeth the floss is between. Be careful not to pull with too much force around the arch wire. Begin brushing teeth by using a regular soft toothbrush. Brush down from the top and then up from the bottom on each tooth with braces. Next, brush your teeth with a Proxabrush or ""Christmas tree"" brush. This brush is specially designed for cleaning between two braces. Insert the brush down from the top and then up from the bottom between two braces. Use several strokes in each direction before moving on to the next space between two braces. Repeat the procedure until all teeth have been cleaned. Every time you brush your teeth, brush your retainer as well, but not with toothpaste. Once a day or at least once a week, disinfect the retainer by soaking it in a denture cleanser, such as Efferdent, Polident, or other brand-name solution. Add the cleanser to a cup full of warm -- not hot -- water. Thoroughly rinse the retainer with plain water before putting it back in your mouth .', 'What Foods Are Off-Limits With Braces? Braces are delicate. Breaking part of the appliance can result in the teeth moving in the wrong direction and in longer treatment. Avoid anything that is hard, sticky, or chewy, including: Ice Nuts Popcorn Hard candy Chewing gum Chewy candy, like caramel Gummies Hard or tough-to-bite foods, such as apples or bagels Corn on the cob Hard pretzels Carrots', 'Braces and Age Your dentist can tell you when to seek evaluation from an orthodontist. The American Association of Orthodontists and the American Dental Association recommend that all kids be evaluated for orthodontics by age 7. By this age, the orthodontist can spot subtle problems with jaw growth and emerging teeth. Most kids begin active treatment between ages 9 and 14. Orthodontists recommend that you correct dental problems while your child is still growing. The mechanical process used to move teeth with braces is the same at any age. That means braces can help both children and adults. The main difference is that some corrections for adults may require more than braces alone. The treatments could also take longer because adult bones are no longer growing.', 'Sports and Braces If you have braces, you can take part in any sport you choose. If there’s a chance you might get hit in the face, you’ll need to wear a specially designed mouthguard to protect the inside of your mouth. It’ll be made of durable plastic and designed to fit comfortably over your braces and will protect the soft tissues inside your mouth.', ""What to Do if a Bracket or Wire Breaks Broken braces, loose bands, or protruding wires can cause problems but rarely require emergency treatment. But call your orthodontist to set up an office visit to fix the problem. If you have a more severe mouth or facial injury, get help right away. Here are tips to get through some of the more common problems until you are able to see your orthodontist: Loose brackets. Apply a small piece of orthodontic wax to temporarily reattach loose brackets, or place wax over the bracket to provide a cushion between the bracket and your gums and other soft tissues of the mouth. Your orthodontist usually gives you orthodontic wax when you get braces. Loose bands. These will need to be replaced or recemented into place. Save the band and schedule an appointment for the repair. Protruding or broken wire. Use the eraser end of a pencil to move the wire to a less bothersome position. If you can't move it out of the way, apply a small amount of orthodontic wax over the protruding end. Do not attempt to cut the wire, because you might accidentally swallow it or inhale it into your lungs . If a mouth sore develops from the wire poking the inside of your mouth, rinse your mouth with warm saltwater or an antiseptic rinse. An over-the-counter dental anesthetic can also be used to numb the area. Loose spacers. These will need to be repositioned or replaced if they slip or fall out completely."", 'Other Problems With Braces and Retainers Because braces and retainers brush up against the inside surface of the mouth, you may be more prone to developing canker sores . If a canker sore develops, your orthodontist or dentist may prescribe a corticosteroid ointment or a prescription or nonprescription solution to ease the pain and irritation and help heal the sore.', 'After Braces After your braces come off, the orthodontist will thoroughly clean your teeth. They may want to take another set of X-rays and bite impressions to check how well the braces straightened your teeth and if you’ve developed any wisdom teeth . If your wisdom teeth are beginning to come in after the braces are removed, the dentist or orthodontist may suggest you get them pulled to prevent newly straightened teeth from shifting. Your dentist or orthodontist will also fit you with a retainer, which is a very important part of post-braces care. Even though braces may have successfully straightened your teeth, they aren’t completely settled in their new position until the bones, gums, and muscles adapt to the change. Also, after long periods of time, teeth tend to shift. That’s why the time frame for wearing a retainer will vary from person to person.', ""How Much Do Braces Cost? The price varies, depending on how much work is being done, the type of braces being used, and where you live, but you can expect traditional metal braces to cost about $5,000 (or less in rural areas). Some insurance carriers provide partial coverage for orthodontic treatment, so check to see what your policy covers. Most orthodontists offer payment plans and will let you make payments over the course of treatment without charging interest. Ask your orthodontist about all treatment fees and payment plans they offer before treatment begins. If your child could benefit from braces but you can't afford them, there may be other ways to cover the cost, including: Financial aid programs. Low-income families can apply to the Smiles Change Lives program. This gives access to orthodontic treatment for children between the ages of 11 and 18. If accepted, the child can receive braces for $250 to $500. To be accepted, you must meet certain income requirements (for example, a family of four cannot earn more than $40,000 per year), and your teeth must be moderately to severely crooked. Medicaid . Medicaid may cover braces, especially if your child's teeth cause problems with talking, eating, or swallowing. This coverage varies from state to state. Dental schools. If you live close to a dental school with an orthodontics program, you may be able to get treatment from a student (supervised by an experienced orthodontist) for a lower cost. Dentists. Some general dentists provide orthodontic treatment and may be able to take care of your orthodontic needs at a reduced rate since they are not orthodontists. Deciding to have orthodontic treatment may not be easy, but an improved smile can make a huge difference in appearance and self-esteem.""]"
19,Osgood-Schlatter Disease,"['What Is Osgood-Schlatter Disease? Osgood-Schlatter disease is an injury that affects your knee area. It happens from overuse. Repeated physical stress and movement leads to inflammation in the specific point where your shinbone (tibia) meets the tendon from your kneecap (patella). It causes a painful lump below the kneecap. It can affect one or both knees and happens most often in kids who play sports or do activities that involve running, jumping, and changing direction quickly. For kids and teenagers who play sports, it’s one of the most common causes of knee pain .', 'Osgood-Schlatter Disease Symptoms The symptoms of OSD aren’t always the same for everyone. Some people might get a severe case and feel constant pain, and others might have a more mild case and only feel pain when they do certain activities. Symptoms can last from weeks to months and can recur until kids stop growing. Generally, the symptoms include: Pain, tenderness, or swelling just below the kneecap Pain that worsens while playing sports, running, jumping, or changing direction quickly Limping after doing a sport or activity In some cases, a bony lump under the kneecap', 'Osgood-Schlatter Disease Causes Sports and activities like basketball and ballet that require movements like running, jumping, and bending at the knee cause the muscles in your thighs (quadriceps) to pull on the tendon connecting your shinbone and kneecap. Over time, this can force the tendon to separate slightly from the shinbone. This is what causes the symptoms of OSD. Some kids with OSD get a bony lump where the tendon and shinbone are separating. This is because their bodies are trying to grow new bone to close the gap that’s developed.', 'Osgood-Schlatter Disease Risk Factors OSD is more common in boys than in girls, but it affects both sexes. Since boys and girls go through puberty at different ages, they can develop OSD at different times. It usually happens to boys around age 13 or 14;\xa0and in girls much younger,\xa0usually around 11 or 12. It happens during puberty because of growth spurts. This is when girls and boys gain a lot of height very quickly.', 'Osgood-Schlatter Disease Diagnosis Your child’s doctor will do a physical exam and look for signs of swelling, redness, pain, and tenderness. They may also order X-rays to take a closer look at the bones and the area where the tendon and shinbone attach.', 'Osgood-Schlatter Disease Treatments Usually, kids with OSD don’t need any specific treatments. The condition gets better on its own over time. The symptoms tend to go away once their bones stop growing. If the pain is very uncomfortable, over-the-counter pain relievers can help. Acetaminophen and ibuprofen can help ease symptoms, as can naproxen . Physical therapy can sometimes help the pain, too. Certain exercises can help stretch the quadriceps and hamstring muscles in the thighs. This may ease some of the tension on the spot where the tendon and shinbone attach. Other exercises that strengthen the quadriceps can help, too, since they can stabilize the knee joint. There are also many things your child can do at home to help relieve the symptoms: Rest. Running, jumping, bending, and kneeling can aggravate OSD, so taking time off from activities that involve those movements can help prevent things from getting worse. Ice. Cold applied to the area can help reduce pain and swelling. Cross-training. If your child has to take time off from an activity or sport of choice, trying something different that’s low-impact, like swimming or cycling, may be a good alternative. Stretching . Doing specific exercises to stretch the quadriceps can help ease some of the tension and pain. Protection. If your child is going to continue playing sports, wearing a protective pad over the injury can keep it safe from more damage. Stabilization with a strap. Using a special strap called a patellar tendon strap can anchor the tendon in place during activities. It fits around the leg under the kneecap and can help spread out some of the force that’s on the shinbone.', ""Osgood-Schlatter Disease Complications Most kids don’t have long-term complications from OSD.\xa0If they do, they might have chronic pain or swelling in the area. Even after symptoms are gone, a bony bump might remain on the shinbone just below the kneecap. But it doesn't usually cause knee problems. In rare cases, OSD\xa0can cause the growth plate to pull away from the shinbone.""]"
20,Ovarian Cysts,"[""What Is an Ovarian Cyst? Ovarian cysts are fluid-filled or semi-solid pockets in or on one of your ovaries. They’re common, especially when you're pregnant or haven’t gone through menopause yet. Most of the time, they don't hurt or cause any problems. You might get one every month as part of your menstrual cycle and never know it. Anyone who has ovaries can get an ovarian cyst. They usually go away on their own without treatment. A cyst can be a problem when it doesn’t go away, gets bigger, causes bleeding, or starts to hurt. There’s also a chance that an ovarian cyst is cancer , but that’s rare."", 'Types of Ovarian Cysts Most cysts are “functional.” They’re a result of your normal menstrual cycle. These most often go away on their own within 2 to 3 months. Types of functional cysts include: Follicle cyst. Your ovaries usually release one egg with each cycle. It grows inside a tiny sac called a follicle. When the egg is ready, the follicle breaks open and releases it during ovulation. If the sac doesn’t open and keeps growing, it causes a follicle cyst. Corpus luteum cyst. After an egg is released, the empty follicle usually shrinks. The follicle also starts making hormones. At this point, the follicle is called the corpus luteum. If the opening where the egg got released is blocked, fluid can collect inside to make a cyst.', ""Other ovarian cysts aren't functional. That means they don't form as a part of your menstrual cycle. These cysts don't always mean you have a disease you need to worry about. But your doctor might watch them to make sure they don't cause you any problems. These\xa0 cysts include: Dermoid cyst. These cysts form from cells that make eggs. They start when tissues from your hair, skin, or teeth collect inside your ovary. Also called a teratoma, these cysts are almost never cancer. Cystadenoma. The cells that cover your ovary can form this type of cyst. It usually contains watery fluid or mucus and can grow larger than other types of ovarian cysts. Endometrioma. Sometimes called chocolate cysts, these complex ovarian cysts are filled with dark brown fluid. They can happen when you have endometriosis. This is a condition in which tissue similar to the lining of your uterus grows outside of it, including in your ovaries. Ovarian cancer. Rarely, an ovarian cyst may be caused by cancer. Unlike other types of ovarian cysts, these are solid masses."", 'You can also get a condition called polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), in which your ovaries make many small cysts with immature eggs in them. When you have PCOS, you may not have monthly periods and your ovaries may not release eggs regularly.', ""Ovarian Cyst Symptoms Most ovarian cysts are small and don’t cause any problems. Cysts more often cause trouble when they get bigger. So what does an ovarian cyst feel like? Most of the time, they don't feel like anything at all. If you do have symptoms, signs of an ovarian cyst might include:: Pelvic pain or pressure Dull ache in your back Bloating or feeling full Nausea Swelling in your belly area Pain during sex Pain during your period A frequent urge to pee or poop The ovarian cyst pain location may be on one side of your lower belly or in your back. Ovarian cyst pain may be sharp or dull, and it can come and go. Most cysts go away on their own, but you may need to see a doctor if your cyst grows large, causes symptoms, or bursts."", ""Symptoms of a burst ovarian cyst A cyst can break open, or rupture. You'll probably feel some pain when this happens, but you might not. You may notice some discomfort a few days after your cyst bursts, too. Sometimes, when ovarian cysts rupture, you'll have discharge that looks like vaginal spotting or bleeding. Symptoms of a burst ovarian cyst may include: Sharp, sudden pain in your lower belly or back Bloating that doesn’t go away Abnormal spotting or bleeding Sometimes when an ovarian cyst bursts, it's an emergency. \xa0Get medical help right away if you have: Sudden, serious belly pain Pain with fever and throwing up Dizziness, weakness, or feeling faint Fast breathing Call 911 or go to the hospital if you have symptoms of internal bleeding from a burst ovarian cyst, including belly pain that gets worse or signs you've lost a lot of blood like dizziness or weakness. You may need surgery to control the bleeding. Difference between ovarian cysts and ovarian cancer Less than 1% of ovarian cysts are caused by cancer. Your odds are slightly higher if you’ve gone through menopause. But no matter your age or whether you can get pregnant, it can be hard to tell the difference between ovarian cysts and ovarian cancer from your symptoms alone."", ""Ovarian cancer and cysts both can cause symptoms like: Bloating and pressure in your belly Urges to pee often Pain in your lower belly or pelvis Pain in your lower back Fatigue Changes in how often you poop, including constipation Losing weight for no known reason But with ovarian cysts, hair on your body and face sometimes grows in unusual ways. Ovarian cancer doesn't usually cause this symptom. Your doctor can take a closer look at your ovarian cyst with an ultrasound or other type of imaging. They may also order other tests. If they think you might have cancer, they may refer you to a specialist to learn more."", 'Ovarian Cyst Causes The most likely cause of your cyst depends on several things, including whether you still have a regular menstrual cycle. If you still get your period, some common causes of ovarian cysts include: Ovulation. Most functional cysts happen when the follicle grows like it should but doesn’t break open to release the egg. Endometriosis. People who have endometriosis, especially advanced stages of the disease, can develop endometrioma cysts. Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). You may get pus-filled cysts on or close to your ovaries if you have a pelvic infection. Abnormal cell growth. You may get dermoid or cystadenoma cysts if cells in your ovaries grow in an abnormal way. Other causes of ovarian cysts when you still have menstrual cycles include: Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) Pregnancy Noncancerous growths Cancer If you’ve gone through menopause, your ovarian cysts may be from: Noncancerous growths Fluid in the ovary Cancer', ""Ovarian Cyst Risk Factors Things that may make you more likely to get ovarian cysts include: Age. You're most likely to get ovarian cysts when you have a menstrual cycle. Cysts are less common in those too young to have periods and after menopause. Hormonal problems. You're more likely to get ovarian cysts if you have a medical condition that affects your hormones, such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Taking fertility drugs. For instance, using clomiphene ( Clomid ) to help you ovulate can increase your risk of cysts. Pregnancy. A cyst that forms during ovulation may stay on your ovary after you get pregnant and throughout your pregnancy. Endometriosis . Anyone with endometriosis can get ovarian cysts, but it's more likely if you have a serious case. A serious pelvic infection. If this spreads to your ovaries, it can cause cysts there. A previous ovarian cyst. If you’ve had an ovarian cyst before, you’re more likely to get others."", ""Are Ovarian Cysts Dangerous? Usually the answer is no. But some people have ovarian cyst complications. Your ovarian cyst is more likely to lead to complications or need surgery if it gets bigger than 5 to 10 centimeters (from about the size of a lime to that of a grapefruit). Ovarian torsion. If cysts grow large, they can make the ovary move and twist. This twisting, called ovarian torsion, is very painful. It also can make you feel nauseous or throw up. Rupture. Cysts can break open, causing serious pain and bleeding, especially if they're large. Sex and other vigorous activities can make a rupture more likely. A ruptured cyst sometimes heals on its own, but it can be a \xa0medical emergency. Infected ovarian cyst. An ovarian cyst can develop from a pelvic infection, forming an abscess . If the abscess bursts, dangerous bacteria can spread through your body. This could lead to sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition."", 'Ovarian Cyst Diagnosis Sometimes, your doctor finds a cyst during a pelvic exam. They’ll ask questions about your pain and other symptoms.', 'A cyst can be fluid-filled, solid, or mixed. To diagnose what kind you have, your doctor may recommend one or more of these tests: Pregnancy test . A positive pregnancy test may mean you have a corpus luteum cyst. Pelvic ultrasound . This uses sound waves to make an image of your uterus and ovaries. Your doctor can confirm that you have a cyst, pinpoint its location, and figure out what kind it is. Laparoscopy. Your doctor inserts a slim instrument with a light and a camera into your belly through a small cut. They can see your ovaries and remove any ovarian cysts. Blood test. If you have a partially solid ovarian cyst, your doctor may want to test your blood for levels of a protein called CA 125 ( cancer antigen 125). It’s often higher in women who have ovarian cancer and in those who have conditions such as uterine fibroids , endometriosis , and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).', ""Ovarian Cyst Treatment Most cysts go away on their own. Your doctor may suggest: Watching and waiting. Your doctor will monitor you over time to see if your cyst goes away or changes. Medicine. There isn't any specific ovarian cyst medication. But your doctor can give you medicine if you're in pain. They might also prescribe birth control pills or other hormonal treatment . Hormone treatments won’t make the cysts go away, but they can help prevent new ones. Surgery. Some ovarian cysts need surgery. That includes those that are large, don’t go away, or cause serious symptoms. You could also need surgery if you’re near or past menopause because your cysts are more likely to be cancerous. Your surgeon may decide to take just the cyst or the entire ovary."", ""Surgeons use two types of surgery to remove ovarian cysts: Laparoscopy . \xa0You're most likely to have this type of surgery to remove ovarian cysts. The doctor makes tiny cuts above or below your belly button. A small tool with a camera allows your doctor to see inside, and a different tool removes the cyst. You can probably go home the same day. Laparotomy. Your surgeon will make one bigger cut in your belly, so they can get to your ovary and cyst better. You're more likely to need this kind of surgery if you have a large cyst or doctors think it may be cancerous."", ""Takeaways Many people with ovaries get fluid-filled cysts that come and go. Usually it's nothing to worry about, but tell your doctor if you have new symptoms of pelvic pain, bloating, heavy bleeding, or bleeding outside of your period. You may need surgery or other medical treatment for ovarian cysts that get bigger, cause symptoms, or don’t go away on their own.

21,What Is Ovarian Cancer? What Causes It?,"['The ovaries are almond-sized organs -- one on each side of the uterus -- that store eggs and make female hormones. When you have ovarian cancer , malignant cells begin to grow in the ovary. Cancer that starts in another part of your body can also spread, or metastasize, to your ovaries, but that is not considered ovarian cancer.', 'What Causes It? Researchers have many theories, but no one knows exactly what causes ovarian cancer. Scientists have not been able to find a single chemical in our environment or our diets that they can link specifically to ovarian cancer, unlike some other kinds of cancer . Certain things -- genetics or the way you live -- can raise the odds that you’ll get ovarian cancer, but that doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll get it. Some ovarian cancers are linked to gene changes first discovered in families with lots of cases of breast cancer . Those mutations are called BRCA1 ( breast cancer gene 1) and BRCA2 ( breast cancer gene 2).', 'If your family came from Eastern Europe or you have Ashkenazi Jewish ancestors, your odds of having one of the BRCA mutations are higher. Another set of gene mutations that raises your ovarian cancer risk is one that causes Lynch syndrome , also called hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer or HNPCC. If one of your close relatives (grandmother, mother, sister, daughter) had ovarian cancer, you have an increased risk as well, even if their cancer wasn’t linked to a genetic mutation. Your risk also goes up if you have a family history of breast cancer, colon cancer , uterine cancer , or rectal cancer. Your risk is higher if you’ve had another type of cancer , like melanoma or cervical cancer . Other things that can raise your risk of ovarian cancer include: Age . Few women younger than 40 get the disease. Most women get ovarian cancer after menopause . Obesity . If your body mass index (BMI) is 30 or higher, some studies indicate your risk may go\xa0up, but those studies are inconclusive. Hormone replacement therapy . While inconclusive, some studies suggest that using estrogen after menopause increases your risk.', 'Your chances of getting ovarian cancer are also affected by your reproductive history: when your period began and ended, whether you had children, and related issues. You have higher odds of getting ovarian cancer if: You never gave birth. You had your first child after you were 30 years old. Your period started before age 12. You started menopause after age 50 . You never took birth control pills . You experienced infertility , even if you didn’t take fertility drugs to treat it. Other things that may increase your ovarian cancer risk include: Smoking Using an intrauterine device , or IUD (Researchers disagree on whether these raise your risk.) Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a problem with your endocrine system that leads to enlarged ovaries Taking large doses of estrogen over a long period of time without progesterone A history of endometriosis (the lining of your uterus grows in the wrong place) Some people believe using talcum powder near your genitals is linked to ovarian cancer, but the evidence on that is not clear. Talk with your doctor about early screening options like blood tests and pelvic imaging if any of these risk factors apply to you.', 'Can I Prevent It? Ovarian cancer is tricky. It’s hard to spot and spreads faster than any other cancer in the female reproductive system . Because so little is known about the specific causes of ovarian cancer , there’s not a long list of ways to prevent it. If your family history points to a higher risk, your doctor can help you decide how best to manage your situation. Options include genetic testing and counseling . If your risk is high, you may decide to have your ovaries removed as a precaution. This surgery is called a prophylactic oophorectomy. Eating a diet low in fat may lower your risk of ovarian cancer, and in general, exercising and keeping a healthy weight can reduce your risk of many diseases. Other things that can lower your odds of ovarian cancer include: Breastfeeding Tubal ligation to prevent pregnancy (also known as “having your tubes tied”) Taking hormonal birth control Daily aspirin use (although if you aren’t already doing this for another medical reason, you shouldn’t start just to prevent ovarian cancer) Hysterectomy (surgery to remove the uterus and cervix )', 'Ovarian Cancer Recurrence and Survival Rates Ovarian cancer comes back, or recurs, after treatment in more than 80% of cases. But the odds of this happening largely depend on how far it had spread (called the stage) when you got the diagnosis. Chances of recurrence by stage are: I: 10% II: 30% III: 70% to 90% IV: 90% to 95% Survival rates are the percentage of people who live a certain amount of time (usually 5 years) after diagnosis. Overall, about 46% of women with ovarian cancer live at least 5 years after diagnosis. By stage, 5-year ovarian cancer survival rates are: IA: 93% IB: 91% IC: 79% IIA: 78% IIB: 73% IIC: 57% IIIA: 59% IIIB: 52% IIIC: 39% IV: 20% Remember that everyone’s case is different, so these numbers are only a guideline. Your doctor can talk with you about what to expect.']"
22,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS),"[""What Is PCOS? Polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS) is a hormonal condition that affects your ovaries, the female reproductive organs that make eggs. It affects about 1 in every 10 women (and people assigned female at birth) who are of childbearing age. It's one of the most common causes of infertility. It can: Stop your periods or make them hard to predict Cause acne and unwanted body and facial hair Raise your risk for other health problems, including diabetes and high blood pressure Some people with PCOS have cysts (small sacs of fluid) on their ovaries. That’s why it’s called “polycystic.” But the name is a bit misleading because many people with the condition don’t have cysts. In fact, many don’t have symptoms at all. That's one reason why up to 70% of those with PCOS don’t know they have it. Polycystic ovaries are those that have lots of immature egg sac cysts (follicles). Not everyone with PCOS has ovarian cysts. (Photo credit: iStock/Getty Images) The condition starts after puberty, but may not be diagnosed until you’re trying to get pregnant. It never goes away, but symptoms usually get better after menopause. In the meantime, several treatments can relieve the symptoms or help you get pregnant."", ""PCOS vs. PCOD Polycystic ovary disease (PCOD)\xa0is another, older name for PCOS. PCOS has also been called Stein-Leventhal syndrome. Endometriosis vs. PCOS When you have endometriosis, the type of tissue that lines your uterus grows in places it shouldn't, such as your vagina or ovaries. Each month, this tissue can break down and bleed. Like PCOS, endometriosis can cause cysts in your ovaries and may lead to infertility. Its main symptoms are cramps and pain in the belly area. Unlike PCOS, it doesn't cause symptoms such as acne or excess body hair."", ""Types of PCOS Some scientists propose dividing PCOS into types based on symptoms and hormone levels: Non-hyperandrogenic PCOS, or type D: You have problems with ovulation (which can lead to irregular periods or loss of periods) and cysts on your ovaries. But your levels of androgens (male hormones) are normal. Ovulatory PCOS (type C): You have increased levels of androgens along with cysts on your ovaries. Non-PCO PCOS (type B): You have high levels of androgens as well as problems with ovulation. Full-blown PCOS (type A): You have high levels of androgens, problems with ovulation, as well as cysts on your ovaries. Informally, you might hear people describe it using other terms that refer to its causes or symptoms: Insulin-resistant PCOS. Often, those who have PCOS also have insulin resistance, which is when your body makes the hormone insulin but can't use it correctly. Insulin resistance increases your risk for type 2 diabetes. Inflammatory PCOS. Inflammation results when your immune system tries to fight off a threat. Research has linked PCOS to low levels of inflammation throughout the body. This could cause or worsen symptoms. Conditions such as insulin resistance and obesity contribute to inflammation. Hidden-cause PCOS. Some websites use this term to refer to PCOS for which the cause isn't known. But this is true of PCOS in general. Scientists don't know what causes the condition, though they believe that both your genes and environmental factors play a role. Pill-induced PCOS or post-pill PCOS. The pill and other hormonal birth control methods don't cause PCOS. But when you stop using this type of birth control, you could temporarily have irregular periods or other symptoms that look like those of PCOS. Hormonal birth control can also mask the symptoms of PCOS. So you might not be diagnosed with it until you go off birth control. Doctors sometimes prescribe hormonal birth control to treat PCOS symptoms."", ""PCOS and Hormones Your body makes many types of hormones. Hormones are chemical messengers that help control many body functions. Some affect your menstrual cycle and are tied to your ability to have a baby.\xa0When you have PCOS, your reproductive hormones are out of balance. Several hormones play a role in PCOS. PCOS insulin resistance Insulin is a hormone that manages your blood sugar levels. Scientists estimate that 30%-80% of those with PCOS have insulin resistance. When your body doesn't react to insulin as it should, you can end up with too much insulin in your body. Some researchers think this excess insulin plays a role in causing your body to overproduce androgens. Other hormones involved in the syndrome include: Androgens. They’re often called male hormones, but everyone has them. When you have PCOS, your ovaries make more androgens than usual. This can keep your ovaries from releasing eggs on their monthly schedule and cause irregular periods.\xa0Extra androgens are responsible for many PCOS symptoms, including acne, hair loss, and unwanted hair growth. Follicle-stimulating hormone. This hormone helps prepare your body for ovulation and helps control your menstrual cycle. Luteinizing hormone. This also helps regulate your monthly cycle, triggering your ovaries to release eggs . Progesterone. With PCOS, your body may not have enough of this hormone. So you might miss periods for a long time or have trouble predicting when they’ll come. Estrogen. When you have PCOS, your levels of estrogen may be too high in relation to your progesterone levels."", ""PCOS Symptoms What are the first signs of PCOS? Polycystic ovary syndrome isn't actually a disease but a set of symptoms. These symptoms can vary from person to person. But the most common signs of PCOS are missed, irregular, infrequent, or too-long periods. Other possible signs of PCOS include: Hair loss . PCOS can cause the hair on your head to get thinner, especially if you're middle-aged or older . Excess face and body h air (hirsutism). At the same time, hair may grow in places you don’t want it, like your face, chest, belly, arms, fingers, and toes. Oily skin. Extra androgens can lead to oilier skin. Acne. You might have breakouts on your face, chest, and/or back. Darkened skin. Patches of skin that look darker than the surrounding area can show up under your breasts or arms, or on your neck. Skin tags. These little flaps of excess skin most often appear on your neck or armpits. PCOS pain. You may have pain in your lower-belly (pelvic) area during your period and occasionally at other times. Weight gain (PCOS belly) . About 50% of those with PCOS have weight gain, especially in the abdominal (belly) area. Ovarian cysts. When you have an ultrasound, your doctor might notice that your ovaries look bigger or have lots of egg sac cysts (follicles). Mood changes. PCOS raises your risk of mood swings and feelings of depression or anxiety. This can be caused by hormonal changes as well as the strain of dealing with PCOS symptoms."", ""Can you have PCOS without symptoms? Sometimes, PCOS doesn't cause any symptoms, or they're so minor that you don't notice them. For that reason, and because many other issues can cause similar period problems, it may take a while to get a PCOS diagnosis."", ""PCOS Causes Doctors don’t know exactly what causes the syndrome. But things that are thought to be involved include: Excess weight. The link between weight and PCOS is complicated. Weight gain plays a role in the development of the condition. But PCOS can also contribute to weight gain. High levels of androgens. This condition, called hyperandrogenism, affects most people with PCOS. Insulin resistance . Extra insulin can affect your ovaries and their ability to release eggs (ovulate). It can also make it easier to gain weight and harder to lose it. Long-term, low-grade inflammation . This also contributes to your body's overproduction of androgens. Is PCOS genetic? The genetic link to PCOS isn't clear, but you're more likely to get it if your close relatives also have it. Some 20%-40% of those with PCOS have a mother or sister with the condition. This may be related to similar lifestyles as well as to genes."", 'PCOS Risk Factors Risk factors for PCOS include: A family history of menstrual problems or disorders (including PCOS) Type 2 diabetes Being overweight or obese Fast weight gain Transgender men (also known as female-to-male transsexual people, or FTMs) are prone to PCOS. Hormone therapy may or may not be a reason for that, as so many other factors come into play. Some studies have shown that while hormone therapy can cause changes to the ovaries of transgender men, it doesn’t necessarily cause PCOS.', ""What Are the Complications of PCOS? When you have PCOS, you have higher odds of having several other health problems, such as: Trouble getting pregnant. Hormonal imbalances can interfere with ovulation . If no healthy egg is available to be fertilized by a sperm , you can’t get pregnant . However, you may still be able to get pregnant despite having PCOS. For that, you might need to take medicine and work with a fertility specialist. Pregnancy complications. Most people with PCOS can have a healthy pregnancy. But the condition raises your risk for diabetes (gestational diabetes) and high blood pressure (preeclampsia) during pregnancy. It also increases the risk of preterm delivery, a cesarean section delivery, and miscarriage. Insulin issues and diabetes. When you have insulin resistance, the cells in your muscles, organs, and other tissues don’t absorb blood sugar very well. So you end up with excess sugar in your bloodstream. Insulin resistance doesn't usually cause symptoms until blood sugar levels get so high that you have diabetes. More than half of those with PCOS will get type 2 diabetes by the time they're 40. Metabolic syndrome. This group of symptoms raises your risk of cardiovascular disease. The symptoms include high triglyceride and low HDL (“good”) cholesterol levels , high blood pressure , and high blood sugar levels . Other possible complications include: Depression Anxiety Bleeding from the uterus and a higher risk of uterine and endometrial cancers Sleep problems, including sleep apnea Inflammation of the liver"", ""PCOS Diagnosis You may be diagnosed with PCOS if you have at least two of these symptoms: Periods that aren't regular Signs your body is making extra androgens, such as acne, excess facial and body hair, or a blood test that shows high androgen levels Ovarian cysts or enlarged ovaries that show up on an ultrasound How to get tested for PCOS No single test can diagnose PCOS. Your doctor will start by asking about your symptoms and medical history. They'll do a physical exam to look for symptoms such as acne and facial and body hair. They may also do a pelvic exam. For this test, they place a gloved hand inside your vagina, then feel your reproductive organs to see if your ovaries are enlarged or if there are other abnormalities. They may also do an ultrasound, an imaging test that shows them whether you have cysts and measures the lining of your uterus. For a transvaginal ultrasound, your doctor places a wand in your vagina that uses sound waves to create images of your reproductive organs."", ""You might also have a blood test to check your levels of androgens and other hormones. Other tests you might get If your doctor thinks you have PCOS, they may want you to get checked for other health conditions that aren't linked to PCOS. This might involve: Blood pressure testing Blood tests for sugar, cholesterol, and triglyceride levels Mental health screening Screening for sleep apnea"", ""PCOS Treatment There's no cure for PCOS. The medical treatment that your doctor recommends to manage your symptoms depends on whether you're trying to get pregnant.\xa0It's important to talk to your doctor about this because certain medications can harm a developing baby. They might prescribe: Hormonal birth control. If you aren’t planning to get pregnant, your doctor might prescribe hormonal birth control, such as the patch, pill, shot, or hormonal IUD. They might contain estrogen, progesterone, or both. They can get your periods on track, help with acne and extra body hair, and lower your risk of endometrial cancer. Progestin therapy. This hormone can help normalize your menstrual cycle and reduce your odds of uterine cancer. It doesn't prevent pregnancy or reduce levels of androgens. Insulin-sensitizing medications . Metformin, a drug used to treat type 2 diabetes, helps lower insulin and androgen levels. While it's not FDA-approved to treat PCOS, it can help with ovulation and period problems. Androgen blockers . These drugs block the effects of the extra male hormones that cause issues such as unwanted hair growth and acne.

But losing weight isn't easy. A nutritionist or dietitian may be able to help. Also, some people find that keeping a journal or using an app to track meals and snacks can make things easier. PCOS diet To manage your blood sugar, your doctor may suggest focusing on foods that are lower in sugar and certain carbohydrates (carbs). Some carbs are good for you, such as those in high-fiber vegetables and fruits. But it's best to limit refined carbs, such as those found in white flour, white rice, white potatoes, sugar, and highly processed foods.

These are called thyroxine (T-4) and triiodothyronine (T-3). Your thyroid controls things like how fast your heart beats and how quickly you burn calories. It releases hormones to control your metabolism (all the things your body does to turn food into energy and keep you going). Hyperthyroidism, also known as overactive thyroid, can speed up your metabolism and cause unpleasant symptoms.', 'Hyperthyroidism Signs and Symptoms Common signs include: Nervousness, anxiety, or crankiness Mood swings Fatigue or weakness Sensitivity to heat A swollen thyroid (called a goiter ). You might see swelling at the base of your neck.

Or you could just feel more tired after everyday activities. Certain medicines can mask the signs of hyperthyroidism. If you take beta-blockers to treat high blood pressure or another condition, you might not know you have it. Be sure your doctor knows about all the medications you take. When you first get hyperthyroidism, you may feel energetic. This is because your metabolism is sped up. But over time, this increase in your metabolism can break your body down and cause you to feel tired. Usually, hyperthyroidism develops slowly. If you’re young when you get it, the symptoms might come on suddenly.', 'Hyperthyroidism Causes Several conditions can cause hyperthyroidism. Graves’ disease. This immune system disorder is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism (70% of cases). Normally, the antibodies in your blood go after bacteria, but if you have Graves’ disease, the antibodies turn on your thyroid instead. This causes the gland to make too much T-4 and T-3 thyroid hormone. Doctors aren’t sure why some people get Graves’ disease, but it tends to run in families. It’s more likely to affect women under the age of 40.', 'Thyroid nodules (Plummer’s disease). These lumps of tissue in your thyroid can become overactive, creating too much thyroid hormone. Plummer’s disease is more common in older people. Thyroiditis . An infection or an immune system problem can cause your thyroid to swell and leak hormones into your bloodstream. With this condition, your thyroid is swollen for no clear reason. This is often followed by hypothyroidism, in which your thyroid doesn’t make enough hormones. These conditions are usually temporary. Thyroiditis can happen: After pregnancy When you get a virus or another problem with your immune system If you take too much thyroid medication You can also get hyperthyroidism if you get lots of iodine in your diet (like in a medication or supplement) or from taking too much thyroid hormone medication.', 'Thyroid Eye Disease About 30% of people with Graves’ disease get a condition called thyroid eye disease. It involves your vision and eyes , including the muscles and tissues around them. Symptoms include: Bulging eyes A gritty feeling, pain, or pressure in your eyes Redness or inflammation in or around your eyes Eyelids that are puffy or pulled back Sensitivity to light Double vision or loss of vision People with Graves’ disease may also get a rare condition called Graves’ dermopathy. It can cause redness and thickening of your skin, usually on the tops of your feet or your shins.', 'Hyperthyroidism Diagnosis Your doctor will ask about your medical history and look for symptoms including a swollen thyroid, a fast pulse, moist skin, and shaking in your hands or fingers. They’ll give you tests that might include: Thyroid panel. This blood test measures levels of thyroid hormones and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). Thyroid scan. A technician injects a small amount of radioactive iodine into your bloodstream. Your thyroid absorbs it, and a special camera takes pictures of the gland to look for nodules or other signs of problems. Ultrasound. A technician runs a device called a transducer over your neck. It uses sound waves to create images of your thyroid. Radioactive iodine uptake test. You swallow a small amount of radioactive iodine. A device called a gamma probe measures how much of the iodine collects in your thyroid. If this uptake is high, you probably have Graves’ disease or thyroid nodules.', 'Hyperthyroidism Treatment Your doctor will help you decide on a treatment based on your age, your overall health, the kind of hyperthyroidism you have, and how severe it is. Your options might include:', 'Antithyroid drugs. Methimazole ( Tapazole ) and propylthiouracil (PTU) block your thyroid from making too many hormones. These medicines will typically ease your symptoms within weeks or a few months, although you will probably need to stay on them for up to 18 months to help lessen the chance of a relapse. Methimazole has less severe side effects, so it’s prescribed more often. Side effects include allergic reactions like rash or itching. Up to 3% of people who take antithyroid medications have allergic reactions. It’s rare, but these drugs can also cause your body to make fewer white blood cells, a condition called agranulocytosis . This makes you more likely to get infections. Rarely, these medicines can damage your liver, so call your doctor right away if you have symptoms like yellow skin or eyes, fatigue, a fever, sore throat , or pain in your belly. Beta-blockers. These medications don’t treat your levels of thyroid hormone but can help with symptoms like anxiety, shaking, or a fast heartbeat. Beta-blockers affect the way thyroid hormone acts on your body. They’re most often used to treat high blood pressure . Side effects may include: Headache Dizziness Digestive problems', 'Radioactive iodine. You swallow a small amount of radioactive iodine. Overactive thyroid cells absorb it, and it destroys them. This makes your thyroid shrink and your levels of thyroid hormone go down. You might need to have this treatment more than once. Because taking this medication makes your thyroid slow down, it may also cause hypothyroidism. This is easier to treat than hyperthyroidism: You’ll take a hormone supplement once a day. It usually takes 3 to 6 months to work. Doctors have used radioactive iodine to treat hyperthyroidism for over 60 years. It’s generally considered safe, and it’s used to treat more than 70% of adults with hyperthyroidism. Surgery. If medications aren’t a good option for you, your doctor may remove all or part of your thyroid. This is called thyroidectomy. You might need to take antithyroid medicines before the surgery to prevent complications. Afterward, you might have hypothyroidism and need to take a hormone supplement. If your parathyroid glands are also removed, you may need medication to keep the calcium levels in your blood where they should be. This surgery comes with some risks. It can damage your vocal cords and your parathyroid glands .', 'Treatments for Eye Problems If you have thyroid eye disease but your symptoms aren’t severe, you can usually manage them by avoiding bright lights and wind, raising the head of your bed, and using eye drops. Your doctor may suggest a selenium supplement. In some cases, your doctor might prescribe a medication called teprotumumab-trbw ( Tepezza ). It’s FDA-approved to treat the symptoms of thyroid eye disease. They might also suggest steroids or other medications to help control the swelling behind your eyes . For some people, especially those with severe thyroid eye disease, surgery is the best option. There are two kinds that can help severe symptoms: Orbital decompression surgery involves removing the bone between your sinuses and eye socket. It can make more room for your eyes so that they go back to their normal position. It can help improve your vision. There are risks to the surgery, including double vision. Eye muscle surgery is sometimes used to correct double vision . It works by cutting muscles in your eyeball that are covered in scar tissue. Thyroid eye disease can cause this. The cut muscles are then reattached in a different position, which can put your eyes back in proper alignment. You may need this surgery more than once to get the right results.']"
24,What’s In Your Joint Pain Medicine?,"[""There are many different names for the over-the-counter (OTC) medications that people take to relieve joint pain . Most products rely on just a few ingredients to do that. Here's what you need to know about the ingredients in OTC pain relievers, including benefits and possible side effects."", 'Aspirin for Joint Pain Aspirin -- acetylsalicylic acid -- belongs to a family of related drugs called salicylates . It is available orally under many brand names, including Bayer, Bufferin , Ecotrin , and St. Joseph. Aspirin relieves mild pain and fever .', 'Side Effects of Aspirin The most common side effects of aspirin are stomach pain , heartburn , indigestion , nausea , and vomiting. Stomach irritation can lead to ulcers and bleeding in the stomach. You can reduce the risk of stomach problems by taking aspirin with food or milk. Other possible risks of aspirin include: Allergic reactions ( hives , facial swelling, wheezing , and asthma ) Excessive bleeding and bruising Ringing in the ears and slight deafness If you have any of these effects, stop taking the medication and call your doctor.', 'Joint Pain Relief: When Should You Avoid Aspirin? You should not take aspirin if you know you are allergic to it. You should also avoid aspirin if you: Have stomach ulcers Have bleeding problems Are scheduled for surgery If you drink more than three alcoholic drinks per day, don’t take aspirin. Doing so could increase your risk of stomach upset and gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. If you have kidney or liver disease , talk to your doctor before using aspirin.', 'Using Acetaminophen to Relieve Joint Pain Like aspirin, acetaminophen ( Tylenol ) is used in many OTC products. And like aspirin, it relieves pain and fever. Acetaminophen is also the active ingredient in many products labeled ""aspirin-free pain reliever"" or ""non-aspirin pain reliever."" To be sure what you’re getting in a medicine, read the ingredients.', 'Acetaminophen Side Effects When taken as directed, acetaminophen has few side effects. But taking more than directed, taking it longer than directed, or taking it with three or more alcoholic drinks every day can cause liver damage and even liver failure . Because acetaminophen is an ingredient in many over-the-counter and prescription medications, it is important to check your other medicines to avoid an accidental overdose . Certain people may have to take a lower dosage or may not be able to take acetaminophen at all.', 'In fact, to prevent accidental overdose, the maker of Extra-Strength Tylenol brand acetaminophen has reduced the maximum dose from eight pills (4,000 mg) to six pills (3,000 mg) a day. Because the signs and symptoms of liver damage from acetaminophen may not be immediately noticeable, if you think you may have taken too much it is important to call 911 or poison control at 800-222-1222 right away. You should not take acetaminophen if you have three or more alcoholic drinks daily or if you have advanced liver disease.', 'Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) NSAIDs work similarly to aspirin to ease joint pain. Although there are more than a dozen NSAIDs available by prescription, only two are currently available OTC: ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB) and naproxen sodium (Aleve). Ibuprofen is also available in many generic and store-brand products and, like acetaminophen, may be the active ingredient in products labeled ""non -aspirin pain relief.""', 'Side Effects of NSAIDs Use of NSAIDs can increase the risk of heart attack or stroke , particularly in higher doses. However, the most common side effects of NSAIDs are heartburn , indigestion, abdominal or stomach cramps , diarrhea , nausea, and vomiting. You can reduce the risk of side effects by taking the medicine with food or milk. Other possible side effects include: dizziness drowsiness swelling of the feet stomach ulcers or GI bleeding headache', 'When to Avoid NSAIDs You should not use NSAIDs for pain if you are allergic to aspirin or similar drugs. If you have heart disease , kidney disease , liver cirrhosis, high blood pressure , asthma or a history of stomach problems, or if you take blood thinners or a diuretic, ask your doctor before taking NSAIDs. If you are pregnant or nursing, you should ask your doctor before taking naproxen, although ibuprofen is considered safe except during the third trimester of pregnancy .', ""The Problem With Combining OTC Pain Relievers Because many OTC products contain the same ingredients, it's important to know what’s in the medicines you take. Otherwise, if you take more than one product, you may get too much of one ingredient. Overdoses of any of these pain relievers can increase the risk of side effects and even be fatal."", 'Some products also combine ingredients. For example, aspirin may be combined with acetaminophen in a single tablet. Some medicines combine OTC pain relievers with other drugs, such as antihistamines, decongestants , or pain medicines to help you sleep. There may be times when your doctor says it’s OK to use more than one drug -- such as when you have a cold or the flu. But you should not use more than one medication long-term for joint pain. If you need more than one drug, ask your doctor to prescribe them separately so you can get the appropriate dose of each.']"
