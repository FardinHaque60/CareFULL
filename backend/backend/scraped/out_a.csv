0,Alpha-1 Antitrypsin (AAT) Deficiency,"What Is AAT Deficiency? Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency is a condition that can cause serious lung or liver disease. Symptoms often include trouble breathing and jaundiced, or yellow, skin. It's a genetic disease, which means it's passed down to you from your parents. You get it because your liver doesn't make enough of the AAT protein, and much of what it does make gets trapped in your liver. You need this protein to protect your lungs from inflammation and damage caused by infections and irritants such as smoke and pollution. If your lungs are damaged, you can get COPD or emphysema. AAT deficiency is sometimes known as genetic COPD or genetic emphysema. And when AAT builds up in your liver, the buildup may cause scarring, or cirrhosis, of your liver. You might not know you have the disease until you're an adult. Most people get their first symptoms between the ages of 20 and 50. Symptoms of AAT Deficiency When you have AAT deficiency, your lungs don't get enough of a protein they need to protect them. This can lead to COPD or emphysema. (Photo credit: Lisa F. Young/Dreamstime) Common symptoms of AAT deficiency include: Wheezing or whistling sounds when you breathe Having colds often Feeling tired A fast heartbeat when you stand up Weight loss If AAT deficiency affects your liver, you could have: Yellowish skin or eyes A swollen belly or legs Coughing up of blood A newborn baby might have: Yellowing of the skin or eyes (jaundice) Bright yellow urine Trouble gaining weight An enlarged liver Bleeding from the nose or umbilical stump Pale, smelly poop Low energy It's rare, but some people also get a skin disease called panniculitis. It is inflammation of the fat layer under your skin and causes hardening of the skin along with painful lumps or patches. How Alpha-1 Affects Your Liver Alpha-1 is a rare disease that makes an enzyme in your liver work poorly. Alpha-1 antitrypsin protein usually travels from your liver through your blood to protect your lungs and other organs. But if the proteins aren't the right shape, they can get stuck in your liver. This can cause cirrhosis , severe liver damage and scarring, and liver cancer . And because the proteins aren't traveling to your lungs like they should, it can also cause lung problems. AAT Testing First, your doctor will listen to your breathing with a stethoscope to check for wheezing or other signs that your lungs aren't working right. Blood tests. These will show the levels of AAT in your blood and measure your liver function. A special blood test called a blood gases test looks at the oxygen level in your arteries, a sign of how well your lungs work. Genetic testing: If your blood levels of AAT are low, these tests will find abnormal genes and see if any have a link to AAT. Imaging. X-rays and CT scans show where damage is in your lungs and how serious it is. Pulmonary function tests. You'll breathe into a machine that measures how well your lungs are working. Liver ultrasound or elastography. These tests will show if there are signs of scarring on your liver. Liver biopsy. A small sample of cells is taken using a very thin needle and checked for signs of damage. Questions for the Doctor It's important to ask your doctor any question you have about this condition. You might start with these: Have you treated other people with AAT deficiency? What treatments do you suggest? Is replacement therapy something that may be right for me? What are my chances of having COPD or emphysema? How will we know how I'm doing? Should my children be tested for this condition? Is it safe for me to exercise? What are some things I can do to manage my symptoms? Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency Treatment There's no cure for AAT deficiency. But you can protect yourself from more lung damage with a treatment called augmentation therapy, sometimes called replacement therapy. It works by raising the amount of AAT protein in your blood. You may also have this treatment if you get emphysema. With this treatment, you get a new supply of AAT protein from healthy human donors through an IV once a week. You can have this procedure at your doctor's office or at home with the help of a technician. Augmentation therapy can slow or stop the damage to your lungs, but it won't reverse the disease or heal any damage you already have. You'll need these treatments for the rest of your life. You may also get a bronchodilator, or medication to open your airways that you breathe into your lungs with an inhaler. If your breathing trouble leads to low levels of oxygen in your blood, you might need extra oxygen through a mask or nosepiece. Your doctor may also suggest that you go into pulmonary rehab, where you can learn breathing techniques and exercises, as well as how to make some everyday activities easier. Why Get Tested for Alpha-1? Though there's no cure for AAT deficiency, there are treatments to delay or prevent lung disease. It's also important to know if you can pass the genes on to family members. A healthy lifestyle--including a balanced diet, regular exercise, and not smoking--can help keep your lungs in the best possible shape. If you do develop lung disease, you can work with your doctor on a plan to help you manage symptoms and feel your best. Your Care Team for AAT Deficiency Your health care team is an important part of diagnosing and treating AAT deficiency. Here are some of the medical professionals you could visit for care: Pediatrician. You're more likely to get AAT deficiency as an adult, but kids get it, too. A pediatrician takes care of the general health of children and young adults, or they may specialize in certain health conditions. Geneticist. Since AAT deficiency is a genetic disease, your doctor may suggest genetic testing to precisely diagnose or help manage it. Geneticists and genetic counselors work with you and your regular doctor to include genetic information in your health care plan. Pulmonologist. These doctors diagnose and treat illnesses that affect your lungs, such as AAT deficiency. Gastroenterologist. AAT deficiency can also affect your liver, one of the organs that gastroenterologists focus on. These doctors mainly diagnose and treat diseases affecting your digestive tract. Pulmonary rehab team. Experts suggest pulmonary rehabilitation for people with AAT deficiency. This is a program of exercise, breathing techniques, education, nutrition, and more. It's designed to help people with pulmonary disease. Doctors, nurses, physical and respiratory therapists, exercise specialists, and dietitians could all be part of your rehab team. What to Expect With AAT Deficiency AAT deficiency is different for everyone. Some people have severe problems. Others may have few or no symptoms. Breathing issues. You'll be more sensitive to smoke, dust, and allergens like pollen. If you catch a cold, your symptoms may be stronger. You also might have chronic bronchitis, an irritation of your airways that causes coughing and affects breathing. COPD. AAT deficiency can cause chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). When you have COPD, you often have symptoms of emphysema, a serious condition that makes it hard for you to push air out of your lungs. COPD can make you wheeze and struggle to breathe. You may cough up mucus and feel tightness in your chest. Liver issues. About 30% to 40% of people with this condition will have liver problems at some point in their lives. While these health issues are possibilities, with treatment, you'll probably still be able to work, be active, and enjoy many of your favorite hobbies. In babies and children, the condition is more likely to cause liver damage than lung problems. Still, only about 10% of children with it have severe liver disease. Children with AAT deficiency also may have asthma. Treating Liver Problems If your liver is damaged, you can get treatment to help prevent or slow down the health problems this can cause. You can also get treatments to ease symptoms. These include: Vitamin supplements Medicines to ease itching or jaundice Treatments for bleeding and fluid in your belly If your liver damage is life-threatening or severe, you may need a liver transplant. How Your AAT Deficiency Might Change Over Time You could have the gene that causes AAT deficiency and never have symptoms or organ damage. This is especially true if you avoid smoking. Meanwhile, others with the illness have serious, even deadly health problems. Other conditions that can happen with AAT deficiency include: Lung conditions that get worse over time, like COPD Lasting airway damage (emphysema, bronchiectasis) High blood pressure that affects the arteries from your heart to your lungs (pulmonary hypertension) Liver scarring Liver cancer Heart, liver, or respiratory failure Inflammation of fat beneath the skin (panniculitis) Many people with AAT deficiency live a normal lifespan, especially if they don't smoke. Others may have serious complications. Your medical outlook depends on: Whether you're diagnosed promptly The type of Alpha-1 you have How the disease impacts you Your level of organ damage How strong your lungs are If your lung or liver disease is getting worse quickly or more slowly If you smoke The best thing you can do is follow guidance from your doctor to manage your condition. Tips for Living With AAT Deficiency Good habits are important to help you stay healthy with this condition. There are several things you can do to manage your symptoms: Stay away from things that can irritate your lungs, like smoke, dust, and pet hair. Steer clear of infections: Wash your hands often, and stay away from others who are sick. Pay attention to how you feel, and pace yourself if you need to. Take your medications as prescribed. Stay up to date on vaccines, including those for flu and COVID-19. Talk to your doctor about how to exercise safely. Limit how much alcohol you drink. If you don't drink, don't start. Don't smoke. If you need help to quit, talk to your doctor. Eat a healthful diet. Make daily tasks easier: Plan chores so you can cut down on climbing stairs, or use a rolling cart to move things from place to place. Get the support you need: Ask friends and family for help with tasks. Consider joining a support group to talk with others in a similar situation. If you have feelings of depression, talk to your doctor or a counselor about what treatments may help. Caring for Your Emotional and Mental Health Living with AAT deficiency can affect your emotional health. You're more likely to have feelings of anxiety and depression than someone who doesn't have it. It's important to be aware of how you feel and take steps to help yourself feel better. Let your doctor know how you feel. If your low mood persists, your care provider may suggest that you work with a counselor or therapist. They may also prescribe medications that can help. Take care of your health. Your physical health can affect your mood, so keep up with healthy habits: Get enough sleep, eat a healthy diet, and stay as active as you can with your doctor's OK. Watch your stress levels. Stress can affect how you breathe, so learn techniques that help you manage it. This can be things like breathing exercises, journaling, meditation, or just taking some ""you time."" Connect with support groups. It can help to talk to people who understand what you're going through. You can find names of doctors, links to support groups, genetic counseling resources, and other information from the Alpha-1 Foundation website. Ask for help when you need it. Whether it's taking over some chores for a while or giving a listening ear, support from your loved ones can make a big difference. Let loved ones know how they can help you when you're not feeling your best. The Future of Treatment While augmentation therapy works to slow or stop lung damage from AAT deficiency, it's only for people who are seriously ill. This means people with less severe symptoms often don't get treatment. Augmentation therapy is also expensive, and weekly treatments can be inconvenient. Also, it only treats lung disease, not liver disease that sometimes forms when you have AAT deficiency. Researchers are now looking into new options for people living with this lifelong disease. Here's a closer look at some of them: Recombinant AAT (rAAT) AAT can come from two sources: human plasma and through the use of recombinant technology. Scientists use this technology to create new proteins or change existing ones. In the future, it could be a more consistent and reliable source of AAT. But it's a newer technology and not approved to treat AAT deficiency. Inhaled AAT People with AAT deficiency have replacement therapy through an IV, which can be inconvenient and uncomfortable. Researchers are now studying an inhaler that delivers AAT directly to your lungs. They've found it may work even better than an IV, since most AAT-related damage happens in the lungs. Several studies have found AAT inhalers are safe and boost AAT levels in the lungs. Other emerging treatments Other treatments for AAT deficiency are in different stages of development. They include: Gene therapy. This involves replacing the faulty gene responsible for AAT deficiency with a healthy one. Research into gene therapy for AAT deficiency has been mixed. The results of one study showed the treatment is safe and worked to keep AAT levels in the normal range. But the results of another study showed lower AAT levels. Stem cell therapy. This treatment replaces damaged cells with healthy stem cells. The stem cells come from people with AAT, which scientists use to study and create treatments for the disease. Small molecule therapy. These are drugs that target specific molecules involved in disease. In AAT deficiency, they could help slow liver damage by stopping the protein from building up in liver cells. This type of therapy shows promise but needs more research."
1,Headache and Nausea,"Headache and nausea are common, and they can happen to you at the same time. Experts don’t know why they seem to be more likely in some people. But they do know things like dehydration, migraine, or other conditions can cause you to have headache and nausea together. Migraine: The Most Common Cause of Headache and Nausea Migraines are the kind of headaches that are most likely to make you nauseated. Of people who have migraines, 8 out of 10 have nausea with them too. Research shows women and anyone prone to motion sickness are more apt to have nausea with migraines. It’s not clear why women are more affected than men, but some experts think it’s linked to changes in hormones. You can also get migraines during pregnancy. You might have pain on one side of your head and you may be nauseated. If you had migraines before you were pregnant, you may have fewer migraines while expecting. Or, you may notice an uptick in your number of headaches. Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS). This gastrointestinal (GI) disorder is linked to migraine headaches, but it’s not a type of migraine. It happens most often in children, though kids usually outgrow them by the time they're teenagers. Some kids with CVS go on to have migraines as adults. You’re more likely to develop CVS as an adult if you have a history of migraines or long-term marijuana use, or you’re prone to motion sickness. Triggers include hot weather, physical or emotional stress, and sinus or respiratory infections. The main symptoms of CVS are sudden episodes of severe nausea and vomiting. These attacks can last for a few hours or several days. You might vomit several times an hour. Between episodes, you may feel healthy and have no symptoms. Doctors might misdiagnose your CVS as food poisoning or stomach flu. Common Lifestyle Causes of Headache and Nausea Your lifestyle affects your health in many ways. It can sometimes increase your risk for headache and nausea. Or, you may have a health condition you can’t help, but you might get headache and nausea if your condition isn’t well-managed or controlled. Here are some examples: Alcohol. If you overdo it, you can wake up with a severe headache and nausea, vomiting, or stomach pain. You might also be dizzy, really thirsty, and super sensitive to light and sound. Or you might have a headache and nausea and vomiting when you’re withdrawing from alcohol. Caffeine. Whether you missed your morning coffee or you’re trying to cut down, caffeine withdrawal is real. In addition to having a headache and nausea, you might feel tired and have trouble concentrating. Nicotine. Too much can lead to a headache and nausea, with or without vomiting. You might also have a fast heartbeat, tightness in your chest, and trouble breathing . Food poisoning. If you eat food that has certain germs in it, you may have headaches and nausea. Or, if you’re throwing up a lot from eating bad food, you might become dehydrated. That can also give you a headache. Other Conditions That Can Cause Headache and Nausea If you’re having headaches and nausea, see your doctor and tell them about your symptoms and what seems to trigger them. They’ll help you figure out what’s going on and help you choose the right treatment. Some common causes for headache and nausea are: Cold, flu, or stomach infections. These illnesses can give you nausea and a bad headache. But unlike migraine headaches, you’ll usually have other symptoms, too, like a runny nose, diarrhea, chills, body aches, and fever. Which ones you get depend on the virus. COVID-19. The coronaviruses that cause COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have similar symptoms. They include headache, nausea, vomiting, fever, a cough, and trouble breathing. Low blood sugar. This can cause you to have nausea and headache. You might faint or be sweaty and confused. A headache can also be a sign of high blood sugar. Without treatment, high blood sugar in people with diabetes can lead to a serious condition called diabetic ketoacidosis. It can cause nausea and vomiting, weakness, confusion, or a coma. Medication withdrawal. Headache and nausea can happen when you stop taking some meds, especially common antidepressants like Lexapro, Prozac, and Zoloft. PMS and menstrual cycle. Changes in your hormone levels can cause nauseating headaches, which usually strike 2 days before, or in the first 3 days of, your period. You might have throbbing pain on one side of your head along with nausea and sensitivity to light. Preeclampsia. This condition is marked by high blood pressure during your pregnancy. You may not notice any symptoms. Or you could have severe headaches, vision changes, belly pain, nausea, or vomiting. You might pee less than usual. HELLP syndrome, a rarer condition linked to preeclampsia, can also cause you to have headache and nausea. Food poisoning. Germs that can lurk in your food may cause headaches and nausea. Or, if you’re throwing up a lot, you might become dehydrated. That can also give you a headache. High blood pressure. A severe headache, nausea, and vomiting are among the symptoms of very high blood pressure. You might hear this called a hypertensive crisis or malignant hypertension. High elevations. When you go to a much higher elevation than you’re used to, you might get altitude sickness, also known as mountain sickness. Headache and nausea are two of its symptoms. Glaucoma. High pressure inside your eyes can cause a headache along with nausea and vomiting. Rare Causes of Headaches and Nausea Some less common causes may include: Inner ear infection Carbon monoxide poisoning West Nile virus Toxic shock syndrome Dengue fever Black widow bite Cluster headaches Brain bleeding Brain injury Brain tumor Brain infection Acoustic neuroma (tumor around the nerves that connect your inner ear and your brain) Malaria and yellow fever Hepatitis A Fifth disease Kidney disease Treatments for Headaches and Nausea Some things that might help include: Reduce your stress. Stress is a common trigger for nauseating headaches. Find ways to cut it, and your attacks could get less severe and happen less often. Quit smoking. Keep a diary to identify any foods that trigger your headaches. Common culprits include chocolate and alcohol. Get plenty of sleep and rest. Take your med s . Your doctor might prescribe drugs to help prevent your headaches, especially if you’re diagnosed with migraines. Meds may also help stop your headache after it starts, or ease your symptoms. You can also take anti-nausea medications during your headaches. They come in different forms, like pills, nasal sprays, suppositories, syrups, and shots. They have a number of side effects, so work with your doctor to find the best one for you. Try complementary treatments. Some evidence shows that biofeedback and acupuncture may help ease migraines and other kinds of headaches and related symptoms, such as nausea."
2,Amyloidosis,"Amyloidosis is when an abnormal protein called amyloid builds up in your tissues and organs. When it does, it affects their shape and how they work. Amyloidosis is a serious health problem that can lead to life-threatening organ failure. Causes and Types of Amyloidosis Many different proteins can lead to amyloid deposits, but only a few have been linked to major health problems. The type of protein and where it collects tells the type of amyloidosis you have. Amyloid deposits may collect throughout your body or in just one area. The different types of amyloidosis include: AL amyloidosis (immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis). This is the most common type and used to be called primary amyloidosis. AL stands for “amyloid light chains,” which is the type of protein responsible for the condition. There’s no known cause, but it happens when your bone marrow makes abnormal antibodies that can’t be broken down. It’s linked with a blood cancer called multiple myeloma. It can affect your kidneys, heart, liver, intestines, and nerves. AA amyloidosis. Previously known as secondary amyloidosis, this condition is the result of another chronic infectious or inflammatory disease such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn’s disease, or ulcerative colitis. It mostly affects your kidneys, but it can also affect your digestive tract, liver, and heart. AA means the amyloid type A protein causes this type. Dialysis-related amyloidosis (DRA). This is more common in older adults and people who have been on dialysis for more than 5 years. This form of amyloidosis is caused by deposits of beta-2 microglobulin that build up in the blood. Deposits can build up in many different tissues, but it most commonly affects bones, joints, and tendons. Familial, or hereditary, amyloidosis. This is a rare form passed down through families. It often affects the liver, nerves, heart, and kidneys. Many genetic defects are linked to a higher chance of amyloid disease. For example, an abnormal protein like transthyretin (TTR) is usually the cause. Age-related (senile) systemic amyloidosis. This is caused by deposits of normal TTR in the heart and other tissues. It happens most commonly in older men. Organ-specific amyloidosis. This causes deposits of amyloid protein in single organs, including the skin (cutaneous amyloidosis). Though some types of amyloid deposits have been linked to Alzheimer's disease, the brain is rarely affected by amyloidosis that happens throughout your body. Risk Factors for Amyloidosis Men get amyloidosis more often than women. Your risk for amyloidosis goes up as you grow older. Amyloidosis affects 15% of patients with a form of cancer called multiple myeloma. Amyloidosis may also happen in people with end-stage kidney disease who are on dialysis for a long time (see ""Dialysis-related amyloidosis"" above). Symptoms of Amyloidosis Symptoms of amyloidosis are often subtle. They can also vary greatly depending on where the amyloid protein is collecting in the body. It is important to note that the symptoms described below may be due to a variety of health problems. Only your doctor can make a diagnosis of amyloidosis. General symptoms of amyloidosis may include: Changes in skin color Severe fatigue Feeling of fullness Joint pain Low red blood cell count (anemia) Shortness of breath Swelling of the tongue Tingling and numbness in legs and feet Weak hand grip Severe weakness Sudden weight loss Cardiac Amyloidosis (Stiff Heart Syndrome) This condition can cause less blood to flow to your heart muscle. Eventually, your heart will no longer be able to pump normally. Some doctors also call cardiac amyloidosis “stiff heart syndrome.” Others say a stiff heart is actually a symptom of cardiac amyloidosis. Either way, amyloid deposits in your heart can make the muscular walls of your heart stiff. They can also make your heart muscle weaker and affect the electrical rhythm of the heart. Stiff heart syndrome can be serious. It may lead to congestive heart failure if it's not successfully treated. Who’s at risk? Cardiac amyloidosis is more common in men than in women. It’s also more likely to affect older people. People under 40 rarely get the condition. You can inherit stiff heart syndrome. Other things that raise your chances of getting it are: Having untreated high blood pressure Being obese Being over 60 Having gone through menopause What are the symptoms? If amyloidosis affects your heart, some symptoms you might notice are: Shortness of breath when you're doing light activity or lying down An irregular heartbeat Signs of heart failure, including swelling of the feet and ankles, weakness, fatigue, and nausea, among others These can be signs of other health conditions, too. So see your doctor to figure out what’s going on. How is it diagnosed? Your doctor will ask you about your symptoms and whether anyone in your family has cardiac amyloidosis or other heart conditions. They’ll give you a physical exam, too. The doctor may do several tests to diagnose or rule out cardiac amyloidosis, like: Blood and urine tests Imaging tests to see inside your body, like ultrasound, echocardiogram, electrocardiogram, MRI, or CT scan Biopsy Genetic testing, if cardiac amyloidosis runs in your family What are the treatments? There’s more than one type of cardiac amyloidosis. Your treatment will depend on the type you have. Among the options your doctor might recommend are: Medications, including chemotherapy and immunotherapy A pacemaker A stem cell transplant While some of these treatments, like chemo and immunotherapy, are also used to treat cancer, cardiac amyloidosis isn't cancer. It's a disease that affects the heart muscle. There's no cure, but there are treatments for most types of cardiac amyloidosis. Getting an early diagnosis is important since treatment can prevent permanent damage. Renal (Kidney) Amyloidosis Your kidneys filter waste and toxins from your blood. Amyloid deposits in the kidneys make it hard for them to do this job. When your kidneys do not work properly, water and dangerous toxins build up in your body. If amyloidosis affects the kidneys, you may have: Signs of kidney failure, including swelling of the feet and ankles and puffiness around the eyes High levels of protein in your urine Gastrointestinal Amyloidosis Amyloid deposits along your gastrointestinal (GI) tract slow down the movement of food through your intestines. This interferes with digestion. If amyloidosis affects your GI tract, you may have: Less appetite Diarrhea Nausea Stomach pain Weight loss If your liver is affected, that can cause liver enlargement and fluid buildup in the body. Amyloid Neuropathy Amyloid deposits can damage the nerves outside your brain and spinal cord, called the peripheral nerves. The peripheral nerves carry information between your brain and spinal cord and the rest of your body. For example, they make your brain perceive pain if you burn your hand or stub your toes. If amyloidosis affects your nerves, you may have: Balance problems Problems controlling your bladder and bowel Sweating problems Tingling and weakness Lightheadedness when standing due to a problem with your body's ability to control blood pressure Diagnosing Amyloidosis A thorough physical exam and a detailed and accurate account of your medical history are crucial in helping your doctor diagnose amyloidosis. Blood and urine tests can spot abnormal proteins. Depending on your symptoms, your doctor may also check your thyroid and liver. Your doctor will do a biopsy to confirm a diagnosis of amyloidosis and know the specific type of protein you have. The tissue sample for the biopsy may be taken from your belly fat (the abdominal fat pad), bone marrow, or sometimes your mouth, rectum, or other organs. It's not always necessary to biopsy the part of the body damaged by the amyloid deposits. Imaging tests can also help. They show the amount of damage to organs like your heart, liver, or spleen. Your doctor will do a genetic test if they think you have a type that is passed down through families. Treatment for hereditary amyloidosis is different from treatment for other types of the disease. Once you’re diagnosed, your doctor might check your heart with an echocardiogram or your liver and spleen with imaging tests. Amyloidosis Treatment There is no cure for amyloidosis. Your doctor will prescribe treatments to slow the development of the amyloid protein and manage your symptoms. If amyloidosis is related to another condition, then treatment will include targeting that underlying condition. Specific treatment depends on what type of amyloidosis you have and how many organs are affected. High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant can help remove the substance that leads to amyloid formation in some people with primary AL amyloidosis. Chemotherapy medicines alone may be used to treat other patients with primary AL amyloidosis. Secondary (AA) amyloidosis is treated by controlling the underlying disorder and with powerful anti-inflammatory medicines called steroids, which fight inflammation. A liver transplant may treat the disease if you have certain types of hereditary amyloidosis. New therapies can slow the production of the abnormal protein TTR. Your doctor might also recommend a kidney transplant. Other treatments to help with symptoms include: Diuretic medicine to remove extra water from your body Thickeners to add to fluids to prevent choking if you have trouble swallowing Compression stockings to relieve swelling in your legs or feet Changes to what you eat, especially if you have gastrointestinal amyloidosis What to Expect Amyloidosis can be deadly, especially if it affects your heart or kidneys. Early diagnosis and treatment are important and can help improve survival. Researchers continue to question why some types of amyloid make people sick and how the formation of amyloid can be stopped. Studies to find new treatments are ongoing. If you have amyloidosis, consider asking your doctor if there are any clinical trials you can join, or search for one by visiting www.clinicaltrials.gov and typing in the search term ""amyloidosis."""
3,Pap Smear,"What Is a Pap Smear? A Pap smear, also called a Pap test, is an exam a doctor uses to test for cervical cancer in women. It can also reveal changes in your cervical cells that may turn into cancer later. Why Is a Pap Smear Done? A Pap smear is done to look for changes in cervical cells before they turn into cancer. If you have cancer, finding it early on gives you the best chance of fighting it. If you don’t, finding cell changes early can help prevent you from getting cancer. If you are between the ages of 21 and 65, you should have a Pap smear on a regular basis. How often you do depends on your overall health and whether or not you’ve had an abnormal Pap smear in the past. How Often Should I Have a Pap Smear? You should have the test every 3 years from ages 21 to 65. You may choose to combine your Pap testing with human papillomavirus (HPV) testing starting at age 30. If you do so, then you can be tested every 5 years instead. HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection (STI), and it’s linked to cervical cancer. A Pap smear, also called a Pap test, is an exam a doctor uses to test for cervical cancer in women. It can also reveal changes in your cervical cells that may turn into cancer later. If you have certain health concerns, your doctor may recommend you have a Pap more often. Some of these include: Cervical cancer or a Pap test that revealed precancerous cells HIV infection A weakened immune system due to an organ transplant, chemotherapy, or chronic corticosteroid use Having been exposed to diethylstilbestrol (DES) before birth Talk to your doctor if you have questions or concerns. They’ll let you know for sure. If you are a transgender man or nonbinary person, it is still important to get regular Pap smears. Shop around to find a doctor who makes you feel comfortable. Pap Smear Preparation You shouldn’t have a Pap smear during your period. Heavy bleeding can affect the accuracy of the test. If your test ends up being scheduled for that time of month, ask your doctor if you can reschedule. For the most accurate Pap smear, doctors recommend taking the following steps, starting 48 hours before your test. Don’t have sex or use lubricants. Don’t use sprays or powders near your vagina. Don’t insert anything into your vagina, including tampons, medications, creams, and suppositories. Don’t rinse your vagina with water, vinegar, or other fluid (such as a douche). Pap Smear Procedure It takes about 10-20 minutes for the whole exam, but only a few minutes for the actual Pap smear. The test is done in your doctor’s office or clinic. You’ll lie on a table with your feet placed firmly in stirrups. You’ll spread your legs, and your doctor will insert a metal or plastic tool called a speculum into your vagina. They’ll open it so that it widens the vaginal walls. This allows them to see your cervix. Your doctor will use a swab to take a sample of cells from your cervix. They’ll place them into a liquid substance in a small jar and send them to a lab for review. The Pap test doesn’t hurt, but you may feel a little pinch or a bit of pressure. Pap Smear Results Your doctor will get them within a few days. They’ll come back either negative (normal) or positive (abnormal). Normal result A negative result is a good thing. That means your doctor didn’t find any precancerous or cancerous cells on your cervix. You won’t need another Pap until you’re due for your next scheduled one. Abnormal result If your results come back positive, it doesn’t automatically mean you have cancer. There are several reasons you could have an abnormal Pap smear. Mild inflammation or minor cell changes (dysplasia) HPV or other infection Cancer or precancer Lab test error Most often, the abnormal test result means there have been cell changes caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV) . That’s the most common sexually transmitted infection (STI), and can be linked to cervical cancer. Changes to your cervical cells caused by HPV can be mild, moderate, or severe. Inflammation can happen if you’ve had sex or used a diaphragm shortly before having a Pap smear. If you have inflammation or minor cell changes, your doctor may take a “wait and see” approach. They may suggest you have another Pap test in a few months. Will I Need More Tests? Your doctor will review your test results and let you know. Their answer will depend on what type of abnormal cells are found in your cervix. The most common ones are listed below. Atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS). Thin, flat cells called squamous cells grow on the surface of a healthy cervix . ASCUS occurs when these cells are not typical. Your doctor will do a test with a special liquid to see if HPV is present. If it’s not, there’s probably no need for concern. Squamous intraepithelial lesion. These cells may be precancerous. Doctors call changes to them “low-grade” or “high-grade.” If they’re low-grade, a precancerous cell may not turn to cancer for many years. If it’s high-grade, the cells could turn to cancer much sooner. Your doctor will likely order more tests, including a colposcopy, an instrument that shows changes in the cervix that may lead to a biopsy of cervical tissue to check for cancerous cells. Atypical glandular cells. These cells make mucus. They grow in the opening of your cervix and inside your uterus. If they appear to be abnormal, your doctor will order more tests, including a colposcopy, to find out for sure if it’s cancer. Squamous cell cancer or adenocarcinoma cells. This means the cells on your cervix are so abnormal, your doctor is almost certain it’s cancer. To be sure, your doctor will likely order two other tests: a colposcopy and a biopsy. During a colposcopy, your doctor will insert a speculum into your vagina, just like they did for the Pap test. This time, they’ll look at the cervix with a colposcope. This is a tool that has a lens and a bright light that allows your doctor to get a better look at your cervix. They will swab your cervix with vinegar or some other liquid solution. It’ll highlight any suspicious-looking areas. Your doctor will be able to see them through the lens on the colposcope. If your doctor finds areas that don’t look right, they’ll take a sample, called a biopsy. They’ll send the tissue to a lab for further testing. Pap Smear Risks A Pap smear is considered a safe procedure. But it’s possible that the test may miss some abnormal cells or cervical cancers . This is called a false negative. Talk to your doctor about the benefits and risks of cervical cancer screening."
4,What Are the Types of Abortion Procedures?,"There are a few types of procedures to induce an abortion that are done in clinics or hospitals. A medical abortion ( mifepristone , also known as RU-486) is a prescription pill and can be taken at home used during the early part of a pregnancy. The type or abortion you get will probably depend almost entirely on how far you are along in your pregnancy . If you’re in your first trimester , you’ll likely have a vacuum aspiration. If you’re in your second trimester (meaning that it’s been more than 13 weeks since your last menstrual period), you’ll likely have a dilation and evacuation, or D&E. If you’re further along than that, you might have a dilation and extraction, or D&X. Almost all abortion procedures are out-patient, which means you won’t have to stay overnight in the doctor’s office, clinic, or hospital afterward. Before the Procedure When you schedule your appointment, your health care provider will probably give you some instructions over the phone. Because in-clinic abortions are considered surgeries, you may have to fast starting around midnight the night before your procedure. When you arrive at the clinic, you’ll fill out some paperwork and answer questions about your medical history. You’ll then get a pre-abortion workup, which includes a physical examination , pregnancy test , blood test, screening for sexually transmitted infections, and possibly additional testing, if your case warrants it. Many providers will also use an ultrasound to confirm how far along you are in your pregnancy and check for uterine, fetal, or placental abnormalities. All of this information, which your doctor will discuss with you during a short counseling session, will help them determine which procedure is right for you. Pain Management Your doctor will also talk to you about different types of pain management available to you during the procedure. For an in-clinic abortion, you’ll probably get local anesthesia , meaning that your cervix will be numbed but you’ll be awake. While 600 to 800 milligrams of ibuprofen usually provides enough pain relief, your doctor might also offer you an oral medication to calm you down or mildly sedate you, so you’re awake but relaxed. If you prefer heavy sedation, meaning you’re in a light sleep throughout the procedure, you can ask if a sedative medication can be given to you through an IV. Vacuum Aspiration (Suction Abortion) Most abortions done in the U.S. take place in the first 12 to 13 weeks of pregnancy. If you opt for an in-clinic abortion in your first trimester, you’ll have a vacuum aspiration, which you may also hear called a “suction abortion.” In most cases, your cervix doesn’t need to be prepped or dilated for this procedure. But if you’re more than about 10 to 12 weeks pregnant, your health care provider may take steps to open your cervix a bit before getting started so that the medical tools can access your uterus. They’ll likely insert little sticks made of sterilized seaweed that absorb moisture and expand, called laminaria. Once you’re ready for the procedure, your health care provider will have you lie on an exam table with your feet in stirrups, like you’re having a pelvic exam . When you’re comfortable and sedated, if you so choose, your health care provider will insert a medical tool called a speculum into your vagina to keep it open, and swab your vagina and cervix with an antiseptic solution called Betadine . They’ll inject an anesthetic into the cervix to numb it, holding your cervix in place with a grasping instrument. They’ll then insert a small tube attached to either a hand-held syringe or a suction machine into your uterus, and clear out its contents. From start to finish, the procedure takes several minutes. Afterward, your doctor will check to make sure that the procedure was successful, and then let you rest for about 30 minutes under observation. Second Trimester: Dilation and Evacuation If you’re more than 12 weeks pregnant, your provider will use an ultrasound to date your pregnancy. The farther along you are, the more prep work you may have to undergo to prepare your body for the procedure. While doctors can do vacuum aspirations until about 14 weeks, the most common type of second-trimester abortion is called dilation and evacuation, or D&E. The first step a provider will take before this procedure is to prepare and dilate your cervix so that it’s not injured in the procedure. They will likely use laminaria sticks, which might be left in overnight. They might also give you a dose of a medication such as misoprostol , either by mouth or through your vagina, to soften your uterus. They may also use tools to help dilate your cervix. Like a first-trimester abortion, you’ll lie on an exam table with your feet in stirrups, and your health care provider will swab your vagina and cervix with Betadine, inject anesthesia into your cervix, and then use a gripping tool to hold your cervix in place. The main difference is that in addition to using a vacuum suction in your uterus, they’ll also use forceps and other medical tools, including one called a curette to scrape the inside of your uterus. Your doctor may use ultrasound to guide them, and will likely use a suction or vacuum to make sure everything is cleared out. Some providers may use a medication, which you would get as a shot into your abdomen , to stop the fetal heartbeat before the procedure. Afterward, your provider may give you a medication to contract your uterus and reduce bleeding. This procedure takes 10 to 20 minutes. You’ll rest for 30 minutes to an hour while your health care providers make sure you’re well. Late-Term Abortion: Dilation and Extraction If you’re having an abortion further along in your pregnancy, you may have to find a specialized, experienced provider to do a dilation and extraction procedure, or D&X. This is a procedure that doctors usually reserve for when there is a serious problem with the fetus or medical complications related to the mother. All the steps leading up to the procedure and steps taken after the procedure are the same as for a D&E, including the ultrasound to date your pregnancy and prep work to soften and dilate your cervix. For sedation, you might be offered a general IV anesthesia, especially if the procedure is done in a hospital. There are a few other options, like labor induction, hysterotomy and hysterectomy . But because they are riskier, doctors only do them if medically necessary. How Much Does an Abortion Cost? The amount may depend on how many weeks pregnant you are, if you get anesthesia or sedation for pain or discomfort, your financial situation, and where you get the procedure. Many clinics offer free or sliding-scale payment options based on how much money you make. To explore these options, look into your local Planned Parenthood or other women’s health clinics. Generally, without other help, you can expect to pay anywhere from: $430 to $600 if you’re 4 to 12 weeks from your last menstrual period (LMP) $540 to $1,100 if you’re 13 to 16 weeks from your LMP $900 to $1,850 if you’re 17 to 21 weeks from your LMP Suction termination (also called suction curettage or vacuum aspiration abortion) may range around $500 to $700. Dilation and evacuation abortions, which are usually for later-stage pregnancies, range from $800 to $2,500. But in some areas, these prices could be as little as $300. In other cases, they may be more expensive depending on your medical needs. If you get conscious sedation as opposed to local anesthetic, your cost may be on the higher end. If you’re 5-10 weeks pregnant, you can use the abortion pill to end a pregnancy. It usually costs about $500 to $1,500. Paying for Abortions In some states, you may only be able to get an abortion if you get pregnant because of rape, incest, or if the pregnancy threatens your life. In these situations, you may be able to receive financial help from the government. The facility that does your abortion will need to apply for government funds in these cases. Ask your provider to complete an application if you need financial help. If you have Medicaid, you can get financial help for an abortion. Some states, including California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, and New Jersey, also choose to use their funds to help people with abortion costs. If you have insurance, abortions might be covered, depending on the rules of the state you’re insured in. Some states have stricter rules than others. If your insurance covers your abortion, it may be free. In some situations, you may have to pay a copay, just like with other medical procedures. For example, Texas only allows abortion coverage if the pregnancy could severely threaten your health or life. If you need a low-cost or free abortion, there are organizations that can help. You can find more information at: The National Abortion Federation: Visit prochoice.org or call 800-772-9100. Planned Parenthood: Visit plannedparenthood.org or call 800-230-7526. National Network of Abortion Funds: Visit abortionfunds.org to find local organizations that can offer financial help. What Happens Next? Once your procedure is done, you’ll rest at the clinic under supervision for about 30 minutes. You can then continue to relax in a recovery area until you’re ready to head home. If you’ve had any sedation, you’ll need someone to drive you. You’ll get a prescription for an antibiotic, too. You’ll probably have some cramping for a few days and light bleeding for up to 2 weeks. Most pain and cramping is effectively treated with an over the counter or prescription painkiller like acetaminophen , ibuprofen, or codeine. Plan to rest on the day of your procedure. You may need a few more days of rest if you had a D&E or D&X. You shouldn’t lift anything heavy for a few days. Ask your doctor when it would be OK to have sex or use a tampon again -- it may be up to a month before you can have anything in your vagina. If you have severe pain, a fever over 100 F, or soak through more than two pads per hour, you should call your provider or the emergency contact they gave you right away. Most providers will have you come back for a follow-up appointment in 1 to 4 weeks to make sure that you’ve physically recovered and are no longer pregnant."
5,Placental Abruption (Abruptio Placentae),"What Is Placental Abruption? Placental abruption is something that can happen suddenly during pregnancy . It can be dangerous for you and your baby . Fortunately, it’s not common. Your placenta develops in your uterus while you’re pregnant. It sends nutrients and oxygen from you to your baby, and it helps get rid of waste that builds up in your baby’s blood . It’s attached to the wall of your uterus, and your baby is attached to that by their umbilical cord. If you have placental abruption, the placenta separates from your uterus too soon, before your baby is ready to be born. Placental Abruption Signs and Symptoms Placental abruption affects about 1% of pregnant woman. It can occur at any time after 20 weeks of pregnancy, but it’s most common in the third trimester . When it happens, it’s usually sudden. You might notice vaginal bleeding , but there might not be any. The amount of blood can vary. Just because there’s not a lot of blood doesn’t mean the placental abruption isn’t severe. Sometimes, blood gets trapped inside the uterus. Other signs include: Pain in your belly or back Tenderness or quick, repeated contractions in your uterus Problems with the baby’s heart rate Placental abruption can happen little by little, too, called “chronic abruption.” You might notice: You have light vaginal bleeding that happens on and off. You have a low amount of amniotic fluid . Your baby isn’t growing as fast as they should. Causes of Placental Abruption Most of the time, doctors don’t know the cause. But drinking alcohol or using cocaine while you’re pregnant can increase your risk. Other things that can play a role include: Placental abruptions in previous pregnancies. If you’ve had it before, you’ve got about a 10% chance of it happening again. Smoking . One study showed that women who smoked before getting pregnant raised their chances of placental abruption by 40% for each year they smoked. Cocaine or other drug use. Abruption occurs in up to 10% of women who use cocaine in the last trimester of pregnancy. High blood pressure . Whether your blood pressure was high before or after you got pregnant, work with your doctor to manage it. Problems with your amniotic sac. This sac cushions your baby inside your uterus. It’s filled with fluid. If something breaks it or makes it leak before you’re ready to give birth, the possibility of placental abruption increases. Getting pregnant later in life. Your chances of having a placental abruption are higher if you’re 35 or older. In most cases, the mother is over 40. Carrying more than one baby. Sometimes, delivering the first baby can make the placenta separate before the next baby is ready to be born. Abdominal trauma. This could happen if you fall and hit your belly. It could also happen in a traffic accident if your abdomen is injured, so always remember to buckle up. You can’t prevent placental abruption, but there are some things you can avoid, such as tobacco , alcohol, and drugs to reduce your odds. You should tell your doctor if you’ve had placental abruption before. They’ll monitor you closely. They also may suggest other ways you can prevent it from happening again. Placental Abruption Diagnosis If you’re having bleeding or abdominal pain , you’ll need to see your doctor right away. They’ll do a physical exam and run blood tests, and also may perform an ultrasound to see inside your uterus. (Ultrasounds don’t always show placental abruptions). Placental Abruption Treatment The placenta can’t be reattached, so your treatment options depend on how far along you are in your pregnancy, severity of the abruption and status of mother and baby. If you’re less than 34 weeks pregnant: You might have be admitted into the hospital for monitoring -- as long as your baby’s heart rate is normal and the placental abruption doesn’t seem to be severe. If your baby appears to be doing fine and you stop bleeding, you eventually might be able to go home. You might also be given steroids to help your baby’s lungs develop faster in case you do go into labor early. If you’re more than 34 weeks pregnant: You might still be able to have a vaginal delivery if the abruption doesn’t seem severe. If it is, and it’s putting your health or your baby’s health at risk, you’ll need a C-section right away. You might also need a blood transfusion . Complications of Placental Abruption If only a small part of the placenta separates, it may not cause many problems. But if a big part or all of it detaches from your uterus, it can cause serious harm to you and your baby. For you, this could mean: Major blood loss that can cause you to go into shock or need a blood transfusion Problems with blood clotting Kidney failure or failure of other organs Death -- for you or your baby If you have a near or complete abruption, you’ll need to have a C-section right away. Complications for your baby could include: Premature birth. This means your child is born before 37 weeks. About 10% of babies born to mothers with placental abruption fall into this category. Problems with development. If your baby is born premature because of this condition, they may be more likely to have health problems early and later in life. Stillbirth. This means your child dies in the womb after you’ve been pregnant for at least 20 weeks."
6,What Is an Abscessed Tooth?,"What Is an Abscessed Tooth? An abscessed tooth is one that is infected in or around the root, creating a pocket of pus. Anyone, from children to the elderly, can get one. If you have one, it won’t get better on its own. You need treatment from a dentist or endodontist , which is a specialist who can help save your tooth. If you don’t treat it, the infection can spread beyond your jaw to your neck, head, or other body parts. Abscessed Tooth Types Regular dental checkups and cleanings can help you avoid the conditions that lead to tooth abscesses. (iStock/Getty Images) Abscessed teeth are divided into types, based on the location of the problem. Periapical abscess This type of abscess forms when bacteria invade the pulp of your tooth's root. The pocket of pus is around your tooth's root, and the infection can go all the way to the tip of the root and to nearby tissues. Periodontal abscess This type starts in your gums and often looks like a pimple on your gum. Abscessed Tooth Causes Your tooth is hard on the outside, but the inside is filled with a pulp made up of nerves, connective tissue, and blood vessels. Sometimes, it gets infected. Most often that results from: A deep cavity or tooth decay Gum disease , also known as periodontal disease A cracked tooth If you don’t treat the infection, it can kill the pulp and lead to an abscess. You can get more than one abscess. One abscess can travel through the bone and show up in several spots. But each is related to only one tooth. Abscessed Tooth Risk Factors Certain lifestyle factors make you more likely to get an abscessed tooth. They include: Not getting regular dental care . When you don't have regular teeth cleanings, tartar, and plaque buildup, inflaming your gums. Poor dental habits . If you don't brush your teeth at least twice a day and floss, you're more likely to have problems such as tooth decay and gum disease. Too much sugar in your diet. If you eat a lot of sweets and drink sugary drinks, you're more likely to get cavities. Dry mouth . You can get dry mouth from certain medicines or just as a result of aging. It increases your risk of tooth decay. Abscessed Tooth Stages A tooth abscess starts with the breakdown of enamel, the coating that protects your teeth. That allows bacteria to work through the next layer of protection and into the pulp of your tooth. A local infection builds up. From there, the infection can spread into your jaw or other parts of your body. Abscessed Tooth Symptoms In some cases, the area around the tooth hurts, but not always. If it does, it’s usually a sharp, throbbing pain, especially when you put pressure on your tooth. It might also spread to your jaw or other parts of your face on the side that’s affected. You might also notice: Swelling Gum redness Bad taste Swollen lymph nodes Sensitivity to hot or cold temperatures Puffy gums A bad odor when you chew with that tooth A rush of fluid in your mouth that's salty, bad-tasting, or foul-smelling, followed by an easing of your pain. That means your abscess has ruptured. The tooth feels loose Sometimes, an abscess causes a pimple-like bump on your gum. If you press it and liquid oozes out, it’s a sure bet you have an abscessed tooth and the liquid is pus. Symptoms of tooth infection spreading to your body The infection from a dental abscess can spread to other parts of your body if it's not treated early on. Signs of that include: Fever Swelling in your face, neck, or jaw Trouble breathing If you have swelling in your face and a fever, or you have trouble breathing or swallowing, go to the emergency room. How Is an Abscessed Tooth Diagnosed? An abscessed tooth won’t go away on its own. See your dentist right away if you have signs of one. It’s important to treat it because there’s a chance it could spread to your jaw or other parts of your head or neck. This is especially true if your immune system is weak because of a health condition such as AIDS or if you are being treated for certain conditions such as cancer or an organ transplant. To find out if you have an abscessed tooth, your dentist probably will: Tap on your teeth. If you have an abscess, it’ll hurt when they touch the affected tooth. Take an X-ray. This can tell your dentist if you have an abscess and if it has spread to other parts of your mouth . Do a CT scan if the dentist suspects the infection has spread to other areas. If your dentist can’t diagnose the abscess on their own, they’ll probably send you to an endodontist, who’s specially trained to work on abscessed teeth . They can tell for sure if you have an abscess and treat it if you do. Abscessed Tooth Treatment The goal is to get rid of the infection. To do that, the endodontist may try: Antibiotics . If the infection has spread past the abscess site to your jaw or farther into your body, you’ll probably get them. However, they won’t cure the abscess. Extraction. If the endodontist can’t save the tooth, it will have to come out. Root canal . You may have heard about this common way to treat an abscess. It’s the best way to save your tooth. The endodontist drills into your tooth and cleans the pulp from inside it and the root canals that go down into your gum. They fill and seal the empty spaces. You’ll either get a filling or a crown . The restored tooth will look and work just like your other teeth. Surgery. You may need it to drain a periodontal abscess. Keep in mind, if an abscess ruptures, your pain will ease but you'll still need treatment from a dentist or endodontist. How to get rid of tooth abscess without going to the dentist Your pain might ease, but that doesn't mean your abscessed tooth is better. That might happen because the abscess has ruptured, or because the pulp of your tooth has died and the nerves are no longer sending signals. An abscess won't get better on its own, and you can't fix it with home remedies. If you don't see a dentist, the infection will not clear up and will spread. Avoiding the dentist could lead to serious health complications. Will the abscess go away with antibiotics? You may take antibiotics to help your body fight the infection, but medicine alone won't cure an abscessed tooth. The tooth itself is the source of the infection, and it has to be dealt with. Abscessed Tooth Complications If you don't get treatment, a tooth abscess can lead to more serious problems. The infection may spread to other parts of your neck and head. If the abscessed tooth is near your sinus, it can create a hole between your tooth and your sinus. If that happens, the infection might spread to your sinuses, open spaces in your face behind your cheeks, and under your eyes. The worst-case scenario is that infection will spread throughout your body. That's called sepsis, and it can be fatal. Can an Abscessed Tooth Be Prevented? Take these simple steps to keep your teeth and gums healthy: Get regular dental checkups and teeth cleanings. Brush your teeth twice daily for 2 minutes with a fluoride toothpaste . Floss daily to clean hard-to-reach spots between your teeth and gums. Make a dentist appointment as soon as possible if you have a loose or cracked tooth. Limit sugary foods and drinks. Sweets and sodas lead to cavities , which can cause an abscess. Cut down on snacks between meals. Takeaways A tooth abscess is a pocket of infection in or around the root of your tooth. You might have pain and swollen gums, and the tooth may be sensitive to heat, cold, or pressure. You might see something that looks like a pimple on your gum. An abscess is a serious issue that needs attention from a dentist right away. Abscessed Tooth FAQs How do I know if my tooth is abscessed? Pain is your main clue. It might throb, or it might be a shooting pain. Your tooth might be sensitive to different temperatures. If your gums are swollen around the sore tooth, that's another sign you might have an abscess. What gets rid of a tooth abscess? You'll need a dentist to drain the abscess and then decide whether your tooth can be saved. If you take antibiotics, that will only help your body fight the infection. It won't get rid of the source, which is the abscessed tooth. How can I treat my tooth abscess at home? The first step is to call your dentist, explain why you think you have an abscess, and set up an appointment. You can't cure an abscessed tooth on your own. To manage your pain until your appointment, try these steps: Take an over-the-counter pain reliever. Ibuprofen may be the most effective for an abscess, but ask your doctor which one is safest for you. Avoid very hot or very cold drinks. They can make your pain worse. Choose soft foods and chew on the other side of your mouth. Use a toothbrush with soft bristles, and don't floss around the affected tooth. Rinse your mouth with warm water. Ask your doctor if it's OK to apply an over-the-counter toothache remedy that contains benzocaine. Is a tooth abscess an emergency? If you think you have an abscessed tooth, set up a dental appointment right away. If you have a fever, or swelling of your face, neck, or jaw, that's a sign that the abscess is spreading -- a serious complication. If you can't reach your dentist right away, go to an emergency room. If you have trouble breathing, call 911 and get emergency help."
7,Amenorrhea,"What Is Amenorrhea? Amenorrhea is when you aren’t getting your periods even though you’ve been through puberty , aren’t pregnant , and haven’t gone through menopause. It’s not about having irregular periods . If you have amenorrhea, you never get your period. Although it’s not a disease, you should tell your doctor about it because it might be a symptom of a medical condition that can be treated. Amenorrhea Types There are two types of amenorrhea: Primary amenorrhea. This is when young women have not had their first period by the age of 15. Secondary amenorrhea. This is when you have had normal menstrual cycles, but they stop for 3 or more months. Amenorrhea Symptoms Besides not having your period, there are some other symptoms you may have, depending on the cause of your amenorrhea: Pain in your pelvic area Changes in your vision Headaches Acne Hair loss More hair growth on your face A milky discharge from your nipples No breast development (in primary amenorrhea) Causes of Amenorrhea Many things could cause amenorrhea. Possible causes of primary amenorrhea (when you never get your first period ) include: Failure of the ovaries Problems in the central nervous system ( brain and spinal cord) or the pituitary gland (a gland in the brain that makes the hormones involved in menstruation ) Problems with reproductive organs In many cases, doctors don’t know why a first period never happens. Common causes of secondary amenorrhea (when someone who has had normal periods stops getting them) include: Pregnancy Breastfeeding Stopping the use of birth control Menopause Some birth control methods , such as Depo-Provera or certain types of intrauterine devices (IUDs) Other causes of secondary amenorrhea include: Stress Poor nutrition Depression Certain prescription drugs , including antidepressants , antipsychotics, blood pressure medicines, and allergy medications Extreme weight loss Over- exercising Ongoing illness Sudden weight gain or being very overweight ( obesity ) Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) Thyroid gland disorders Tumors on the ovaries or brain (rare) Chemo and radiation treatments for cancer Uterine scarring If you've had your uterus or ovaries removed, you will also stop menstruating. Amenorrhea Diagnosis Because many things can cause amenorrhea, it may take time to find the exact cause. Your doctor will first take your medical history and give you a physical and pelvic exam . If you’re sexually active, they might first order a pregnancy test to rule out pregnancy as a cause. It may take several kinds of tests to find out what’s causing your amenorrhea. Your doctor may use one or more of the following: Blood tests. These measure the levels of certain hormones in your blood, including follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), thyroid-stimulating hormone, prolactin , and male hormones. Too much or too little of these hormones can interfere with the menstrual cycle. Imaging tests . These tests can show abnormalities of your reproductive organs or the location of tumors. The tests include ultrasound , computerized tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Hormone challenge test. Your doctor will give you a hormonal medication that should cause menstrual bleeding when you stop taking it. If you don’t, this can mean that a lack of estrogen is behind your amenorrhea. Hysteroscopy. Your doctor will put a small lighted camera through your vagina and cervix to look at the inside of your uterus. Genetic screening. Looks for genetic changes that can stop your ovaries from working, and for X chromosomes that are partly or completely missing (Turner’s syndrome). Chromosome tests (karyotype). Identifies missing, extra, or rearranged cells in your chromosomes to help pinpoint abnormalities that can cause amenorrhea. Amenorrhea Treatment and Home Care Treatment for amenorrhea will focus on the condition that causes it. Hormone replacement therapy or birth control pills can help start your menstrual cycle again. A thyroid or pituitary disorder can be treated with medication. Physical abnormalities may need surgery. If something such as stress , weight gain or loss, or depression is affecting your menstrual cycle, you can take an active role in your treatment by taking steps to manage it. Friends, family, or your doctor may be able to help you. You can help your doctor trace the cause of your amenorrhea by tracking changes in your cycle and symptoms and sharing this information with them. Tell them what medications you’re taking, and about changes in your diet, exercise habits, and stress levels."
8,Understanding Absence Seizure -- the Basics,"What Is an Absence Seizure? Affecting about two of every 1,000 people, absence seizures (formerly called ''petit mal'' seizures ) are caused by abnormal and intense electrical activity in the brain . Normally, the brain 's nerve cells (neurons) communicate with one another by firing tiny electric signals. But with a seizure, these signals become abnormal. Seizures may affect an isolated part of the brain or may involve abnormal activity in the whole brain (called generalized seizures ). Absence seizures are one form of generalized seizure. They typically are brought on by exertion of some sort. Typically, this type of seizure lasts between 10 and 30 seconds. The person, most often a child aged 5 to 15, abruptly stops whatever they're doing (talking, walking) and appears to ""stare into space."" Absence seizures rarely cause a true convulsion in which the person falls down or collapses. Despite briefly losing consciousness, the person recovers fully with no lingering confusion or other ill effects. These ""spells"" may occur infrequently or several times per hour. In children, absence seizures may interfere with learning and are often misinterpreted as daydreaming or inattention. About a quarter of people who have absence seizures will develop another type of generalized seizure called tonic-clonic seizures (formerly called ''grand mal'' seizures). The vast majority of children, however, will outgrow them. What Causes Absence Seizures? Scientists are unsure of the underlying reasons for absence seizures; however, some research suggests that genetics may play a role."
9,Signs of Child Abuse,"What Are the Signs of Child Abuse? When you think of child abuse, your first thought may be of a child with bruises or other marks that raise red flags. But the signs aren’t always so clear. Abuse can be physical, sexual, or emotional. Or a child may be neglected, meaning their caregivers don’t provide for basic needs, like food or safety. What makes abuse even harder to stop is that most of the time, the abuser is someone the child knows. They may be reluctant to say something because they may want to protect that person or they are afraid of what the abuser will do if they speak up. It’s important to know how to recognize different types of abuse, and what you can do if you suspect it. Types of Child Abuse Child abuse happens when someone harms a child’s body or emotional health, development, and well-being. There are 4 main types. Physical abuse means that someone hurts a child’s body or puts them in physical danger. It doesn’t matter if the child gets seriously hurt or if it leaves a mark. Any harm is abuse. It includes when someone: Burns a child Hits, kicks, or bites Holds the child under water Shakes or throws the child Throws objects at the child Ties up the child Sexual abuse is any kind of sexual activity with a child, not just physical contact. It includes when someone: Forces a child to take part in pornographic pictures or videos Has any sexual contact with the child, from kissing in a sexual way to having sex Makes phone calls or sends emails, texts, or other messages that are sexual in any way Shows the child someone else’s genitals, as with “flashing” Shows pornography Tells “dirty” jokes or stories Emotional abuse is a pattern of behaviors that harm a child’s emotional well-being and development. This can mean when someone: Abuses others when the child is around, such as a parent, brother, sister, or pet Fails to show love and affection Ignores the child and doesn’t give emotional support and guidance Shames, belittles, criticizes, or embarrasses Teases, threatens, bullies, or yells Neglect is when a caregiver doesn’t give the child basic care and protection, such as: Clothing Food Heat in cold weather Housing with clean living conditions Medical care Neglect is also when someone leaves the child alone for long stretches of time or under dangerous conditions. Other types of child abuse include: Parental substance abuse. This happens when adults neglect or harm children through the use of drugs or alcohol . It includes situations like: A parent not able to care for a child because they're high on drugs or alcohol Giving illegal drugs or alcohol to a child Making methamphetamine (meth) while a child is around A pregnant woman's abuse of drugs or alcohol, which exposes her baby to these substances Medical neglect or abuse. A child is medically neglected when their caregivers don't provide them with needed medical or mental health treatment. Medical abuse is a rare situation in which a caregiver lies about a child's symptoms or harms them to try to get unnecessary medical attention. It's also called Munchausen syndrome by proxy . Abandonment. Many states consider this a form of child neglect. It happens when a parent leaves a child with no support or concern for their well-being, or when the parent's location is unknown. Human trafficking. This is basically a type of slavery. Children are trafficked when they're used for prostitution or pornography, or to beg, sell drugs, or work long hours for little pay. Signs of Child Abuse Abuse can be hard to recognize. Kids can get cuts and bruises or show signs of stress for lots of reasons that are a normal part of childhood. So it helps to know specific signs to look for, and trust your gut as you look at the whole picture of the child’s physical and emotional health. Signs of physical abuse may include: Bruises, welts, or other injuries that can’t be explained or don’t match with the child’s story Burns , especially from cigarettes, that can’t be explained Injury marks that have a pattern, like from a hand, belt, or other objects Injuries that are at different stages of healing Medical or dental issues that go untreated Kids who’ve been physically abused may also: Avoid any kind of touch or physical contact Be afraid to go home Seem to always be on high alert Wear clothing that doesn’t match the weather -- such as long sleeves on hot days -- to cover up bruises Withdraw from friends and activities Signs of sexual abuse may include: Avoiding a certain person for no clear reason Bloody, torn, or stained underwear Bruising or bleeding around the genitals Pain or itching around the genitals that might cause problems walking or sitting Pregnancy or STDs , especially for children under 14 years old Refusing to change clothes in front of others Running away from home Sexual activity or knowledge that people usually have only when they’re older Signs of emotional abuse may include: Constant worry about doing something wrong Speech problems or delays in learning and emotional development Depression and low self-esteem Doing poorly in school Extreme behavior, such as being way too obedient or way too demanding Headaches and stomachaches with no clear cause The child doesn’t seem close to a parent or caregiver Showing little interest in friends and activities Signs of neglect may include: Always looking dirty Being left alone or in the care of other young children Eating more than usual at a meal or saving food for later Missing a lot of school Poor weight gain and growth Doesn’t get medical, dental, or mental health care (medical neglect) You may see the same signs of neglect in children whose parents or caregivers abuse alcohol or other drugs. Signs of child trafficking could include: Missing school often Running away from home Sudden changes in style of dress or relationships Has an older ""boyfriend"" or ""girlfriend"" They talk about needing to pay off a debt They often care for children who aren't members of their family Their responses to questions seem rehearsed What to Do if You Suspect Abuse If you suspect child abuse, it’s important to report it. It isn’t a private matter or a family problem. A child’s physical and emotional well-being, and maybe even their life, could be at stake. You don’t need proof to report abuse. If you suspect it, call your local child protective services, police, a hospital, or a hotline, such as the Childhelp National Child Abuse Hotline at 800-422-4453. You don’t have to give your name. If you suspect child trafficking, call the National Human Trafficking Hotline at 888-373-7888. Depending on the situation, there are many ways you can help the child: If they need medical care right away, call 911. Take the child to the hospital -- it’s a haven for abused children. Doctors can check for signs of abuse and give medical care. Help the child stay safe. If you think someone like a babysitter or day-care worker has abused your child, keep the child away from them and contact police. If you suspect a parent or caregiver, supervise the child while they're around that person. If the abuse happened at school, tell the principal about it. But report it to your local or state child protection agency, too. Help the child get therapy to start healing the emotional damage of the abuse. Encourage the child to talk to you about what happened. But don't make it an interrogation. Focus on listening. Make sure they feel supported and know this is not their fault. It’s best to not confront the abuser yourself. Instead, contact police or a child protection agency and let them handle it."
10,What Is Epidermolysis Bullosa?,"Epidermolysis bullosa is a rare genetic condition that makes skin so fragile that it can tear or blister at the slightest touch. Children born with it are often called “Butterfly Children” because their skin seems as fragile as a butterfly wing. Mild forms may get better with time. But severe cases can be painful, trigger other serious health issues, and can be life-threatening. If you have this condition, you need special treatment to keep your delicate skin as healthy as possible. Types There are five major types of epidermolysis bullosa. The kind you have depends on where your blisters tend to form. Epidermolysis Bullosa Simplex: The most common type, it first shows up in newborns. It mainly affects the palms of the hands and soles of the feet . Junctional epidermolysis bullosa : While it also first appears in babies, this is a more severe form that causes blistering in deep layers of the skin. Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa: If you have this type, your skin doesn’t have collagen to hold it together, or the collagen you do have doesn’t work well. This means the layers of your skin don’t seal together like they should. Sometimes this type doesn’t show up until early childhood. Kindler syndrome: This is a mixed condition since blisters appear across different skin layers. It can also cause patchy changes in your skin coloring when it’s exposed to the sun. Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita: This form causes blisters on your hands and feet as well as in mucous membranes like the mouth . Causes Almost all types of epidermolysis bullosa run in families. If you inherited certain gene glitches from your parents, you will have it. There’s one exception. Epidermolysis bullosa aquisita is the only type that’s not inherited. It happens because of a problem in your immune system . Symptoms Usually, signs of epidermolysis bullosa first appear in babies or toddlers . Painful skin blisters are the main symptom. They can form anywhere on the skin. Sometimes they also form on the eyes , or in parts of the throat, stomach , or bladder . If these blisters become infected or scar the skin, they cause more problems. Diagnosis To confirm the condition, your doctor may take a small sample of skin and send it to a lab where experts will use a microscope to look at it. Treatment There’s no cure for epidermolysis bullosa. But there are treatments for it. If you have a severe case, you’ll care for your skin much like someone who has a burn does. You’ll need to learn how to perform daily wound treatment and how to bandage and protect affected areas. Your doctor can also prescribe a medicine to help with pain relief. In some cases, you might need surgery. If you have blisters that have fused your fingers and toes together, your doctor can separate them. Or if your esophagus , the tube connecting your mouth to your stomach , becomes too scarred, you can get surgery to widen it to help you eat. Some people with epidermolysis bullosa still find eating too painful. In that case, your doctor may suggest a feeding tube so food goes right into your stomach. Tips for At-Home Care To help prevent blisters, you have to take special care of your skin. Reduce friction. Use lotion to keep your skin moist and reduce friction. If you cover wounds, use only dressings that aren’t sticky, then loosely wrap again with rolled gauze. Wear loose-fitting clothes without tags, tight sleeves, or seams. Drain blisters. If left untreated, these can fill with fluid and become infected. Your doctor can show you the best way to drain them. Keep cool. Keep your bath water no warmer than room temperature. Stay in air conditioning as much as you can and avoid heat and humidity. Know the signs of infection. Your skin may get red or feel hot to the touch if it is becoming infected. You could also notice pus or a yellow discharge crusting at the site, a red streak under the skin, or have fever or chills. If you see any of these signs, call your doctor right away. You may need antibiotics . Check your diet . Many people with epidermolysis bullosa have low levels of iron, selenium , or vitamin D . Your doctor may suggest that you see a nutritionist about eating more foods that are rich in these vitamins and minerals. Get support. Talk to your doctor or someone you trust. You might also find it helpful to talk about your feelings to a therapist or at a support group in your area."
11,Skin and Acanthosis Nigricans,"Acanthosis nigricans is a skin disorder that results in velvety, light-brown-to-black markings that occur in areas including the neck, armpits, groin, and under the breasts . What Causes Acanthosis Nigricans? Acanthosis nigricans can affect otherwise healthy people, or it can be associated with certain medical conditions. Sometimes acanthosis nigricans is congenital (something a person is born with). It also can occur as a result of obesity or an endocrine (glandular) disorder. It is frequently found in obese people with diabetes or a tendency towards diabetes and is most common among people of African descent. There are many other possible causes of acanthosis nigricans, including: Acanthosis nigricans. Also called Velvety plaques, this is a thickening of the outer layer of skin resulting in a discoloration of brown-to-black. They can develop in the folds of the armpit, groin and/or neck and can start showing up during childhood or adulthood. Seeing this condition suggests diabetes or simply obesity. In rare cases acanthosis nigricans occurring in other places, such the hands or lips, may indicate an internal malignancy. Addison's disease, a condition caused by a deficiency of hormones from the adrenal gland Disorders of the pituitary gland within the brain Growth hormone therapy Hypothyroidism (low levels of thyroid hormone caused by decreased activity of the thyroid gland) Oral contraceptives Most people with acanthosis nigricans have an insulin level that is higher than that of people of the same weight who don't have acanthosis nigricans. Eating too much of the wrong foods, especially starches and sugars, can raise insulin levels. Rarely, people with certain types of cancer can also develop acanthosis nigricans. How Is Acanthosis Nigricans Diagnosed? The condition can be diagnosed by a doctor through a medical history and physical exam . How Is Acanthosis Nigricans Treated? Eating a special diet can help reduce circulating insulin and may lead to some improvement of the acanthosis nigricans. Other treatments to improve skin appearance include Retin-A, 20% urea, alpha hydroxyacids, topical vitamin D , and salicylic acid prescriptions . These are only minimally effective, however. Acanthosis nigricans caused by a drug may go away once the medication is stopped. Can Acanthosis Nigricans Be Prevented? When acanthosis nigricans is related to obesity , weight management is an important part of prevention. A diet that contributes to reduced insulin also can help prevent acanthosis nigricans. Other preventive strategies include treating medical problems that are linked to acanthosis nigricans (such as hypothyroidism ) and avoiding medications that tend to cause or worsen the condition (like birth control pills )."
12,What Is Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma?,"Adenoid cystic carcinoma is a rare kind of cancer that usually starts in the glands that make saliva . These are under your tongue and on each side of your jaw below the jawbone. But it also can occur in other parts of your mouth and throat or other areas of your body, such as your sweat glands or tear glands. Of the 1.9 million people who get cancer each year in the U.S., about 1,300 of them have adenoid cystic carcinoma. It affects more women than men, and it can happen at any age typically between your teens and your 80s. It tends to grow slowly, so it sometimes can spread to other parts of your body before you notice any symptoms. It can come back in places where it's been treated before or spread to your lungs , liver , or bones, where it's more serious. Doctors don't know what causes adenoid cystic carcinoma. It may be linked to some carcinogens, like pollution or asbestos . Symptoms The first sign may be a lump inside your mouth under your tongue or inside your cheek. These lumps usually grow slowly and don't hurt. You might have some trouble swallowing, or your voice might sound hoarse. This type of cancer can spread along nerves, so you might have some pain or numbness in your face. If you notice any of these symptoms, see your doctor. Diagnosis If your doctor thinks you might have adenoid cystic carcinoma, the first step is often a biopsy . They'll take a small sample of the tumor, either after making a small cut or with a needle. A pathologist, a doctor who specializes in the study of diseases, will study the sample to look for signs of cancer. These kinds of tumors can take different forms. They can be solid or round and hollow like a tube, or cribriform, which means they have holes in them like Swiss cheese. The solid tumors usually grow faster. Your doctor might want to find out the size and location of a tumor or look for signs the cancer has spread. You might have one of these tests: MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): Powerful magnets and radio waves are used to make detailed images. CT scan (computerized tomography): Several X-rays taken from different angles are put together to show more information. PET scan (positron emission tomography): Radiation is used to make 3-dimensional color images. Treatment The usual treatment for adenoid cystic carcinoma is surgery followed by radiation treatments. When you have surgery, your doctor will remove not only the tumor but also some of the healthy tissue around it. They'll look at that tissue to make sure the cancer hasn't spread beyond the tumor. Unlike many other cancers, which can go to other parts of your body through your lymph nodes, adenoid cystic carcinoma spreads along your nerves. Your doctor will look at your nerves to make sure the cancer isn't in the area around them and will try to remove any cancerous tissue without damaging them. Sometimes, part of a nerve may have to be removed to get all the cancer out. That can mean you won't be able to move part of your face or it might droop. Your doctor may try to reconnect the damaged nerve with part of another nerve so you can move the affected area. Other times, part of your windpipe or voice box has to be removed. If your doctor can't take out the entire tumor without hurting important organs, or if they're worried the cancer has spread somewhere they haven't seen, you may have radiation treatments. There are three main kinds: External beam radiation focuses high-energy X-rays or protons on cancer cells to destroy them. Your doctor will try to do as little damage as possible to the surrounding parts of your body. Internal radiation therapy is also known as brachytherapy. Your doctor will put small radioactive ""seeds"" at or near the tumor. This is often used when cancer has spread to the lungs . The radioactivity of the seeds lessens after a few weeks. Neutron therapy can target small tumors by heating up the cells with 100 times more energy than regular radiation treatment. That often kills cancer cells while letting the normal cells around them recover. Radiation therapy focused on your head and neck has side effects that can include dry mouth , difficulty swallowing, or soreness around the area that's being treated. It can also damage your teeth . Check with your doctor about these side effects and ask what they can do to help you with them. What to Expect It can be hard to get rid of the cancer entirely. Tumors may come back years later, either in the same place or, more likely, somewhere else -- usually in your lungs. Almost 90% of people who have adenoid cystic carcinoma live at least 5 years after their diagnosis. After your treatment, you'll need regular checkups to look for signs of new tumors. This can involve X-rays, CT scans, or MRIs, depending on your diagnosis."
13,Epilepsy and the Corpus Callosotomy,"What Is a Corpus Callosotomy? The corpus callosum is a band of nerve fibers located deep in the brain that connects the two halves (hemispheres) of the brain . It helps the hemispheres share information, but it also contributes to the spread of seizure impulses from one side of the brain to the other. A corpus callosotomy is an operation that severs (cuts) the corpus callosum, interrupting the spread of seizures from hemisphere to hemisphere. Seizures generally do not completely stop after this procedure (they continue on the side of the brain in which they originate). However, the seizures usually become less severe, as they cannot spread to the opposite side of the brain. Who Is a Candidate for a Corpus Callosotomy? A corpus callosotomy, sometimes called split-brain surgery, may be performed in people with the most extreme and uncontrollable forms of epilepsy , when frequent seizures affect both sides of the brain. People considered for corpus callosotomy are typically those who do not respond to treatment with antiseizure medications . What Happens Before a Corpus Callosotomy? Candidates for corpus callosotomy undergo an extensive pre-surgery evaluation -- including seizure monitoring, electroencephalography (EEG), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET). These tests help the doctor pinpoint where the seizures begin and how they spread in the brain. It also helps the doctor determine if a corpus callosotomy is an appropriate treatment. What Happens During a Corpus Callosotomy? A corpus callosotomy requires exposing the brain using a procedure called a craniotomy. After the patient is put to sleep with anesthesia, the surgeon makes an incision in the scalp, removes a piece of bone and pulls back a section of the dura, the tough membrane that covers the brain. This creates a ""window"" in which the surgeon inserts special instruments for disconnecting the corpus callosum. The surgeon gently separates the hemispheres to access the corpus callosum. Surgical microscopes are used to give the surgeon a magnified view of brain structures. In some cases, a corpus callosotomy is done in two stages. In the first operation, the front two-thirds of the structure is cut, but the back section is preserved. This allows the hemispheres to continue sharing visual information. If this does not control the serious seizures, the remainder of the corpus callosum can be cut in a second operation. After the corpus callosum is cut, the dura and bone are fixed back into place, and the scalp is closed using stitches or staples. What Happens After a Corpus Callosotomy? The patient generally stays in the hospital for two to four days. Most people having a corpus callosotomy will be able to return to their normal activities, including work or school, in six to eight weeks after surgery. The hair next to the incision will grow back over the area and hide the surgical scar. The person will continue taking antiseizure drugs. How Effective Is a Corpus Callosotomy? Corpus callosotomy is successful in stopping drop attacks, or atonic seizures in which a person suddenly loses muscle tone and falls to the ground, in about 50% to 75% of cases. This can decrease the risk of injury and improve the person's quality of life. What Are the Side Effects of Corpus Callosotomy? The following symptoms may occur after having a corpus callosotomy, although they generally go away on their own: Scalp numbness Nausea Feeling tired or depressed Headaches Difficulty speaking, remembering things, or finding words Paralysis, weakness, loss of sensation Change in personality What Are the Risks of a Corpus Callosotomy? Serious problems are uncommon with a corpus callosotomy, but there are risks, including: Risks associated with surgery, including infection, bleeding, and an allergic reaction to anesthesia Swelling in the brain Lack of awareness of one side of the body Loss of coordination Problems with speech, such as stuttering Increase in partial seizures (occurring on one side of the brain) Stroke"
14,Congenital Hypotrichosis,"Hypotrichosis is the term dermatologists use to describe a condition of no hair growth. Unlike alopecia , which describes hair loss where formerly there was hair growth, hypotrichosis describes a situation where there wasn't any hair growth in the first place. Hypotrichoses (plural) then are conditions that affect individuals right from birth and usually stay with them throughout their lives. The majority of hypotrichoses are due to genetic aberrations or defects of embryonic development. There are hundreds of types of genetic hypotrichoses. Often, affected individuals have other physical or mental problems beyond a lack of hair. Conditions such as Graham-Little syndrome, Ofuji syndrome, cartilage-hair hypoplasia, Jeanselme and Rime hypotrichosis, Marie Unna hypotrichosis, and metaphyseal chondrodysplasia, among many others, can involve the symptom of hypotrichosis. With the rapidly improving understanding of the human genome, our comprehension of why and how genetic defects cause hair loss and other symptoms is growing. But, while we may understand the genetics and the biochemistry behind hypotrichoses, treating them is very difficult. Most conditions involving hypotrichosis have no known treatment. A few forms of hypotrichosis are worth mentioning, either because they are relatively common or because they are interesting in terms of understanding hair follicles. Congenital Aplasia Aplasia cutis congenita, or congenital aplasia, is a developmental defect where, for reasons not understood, the skin does not fully form as an embryo develops. A baby may be born with a patch of skin that is like an open wound or an ulcer. Often this defect occurs at the back of the scalp, at the center of the ""whorl pattern"" of hair growth. If the defect is small, the skin will scab over and the baby is left with a scar. Sometimes this happens in the womb and all that can be seen at birth is a patch of scalp where there are no hair follicles. However, if a baby is born with a large congenital aplasia, it usually requires an operation to cut out the affected area and close up the skin. This is often done with some urgency, since the open wound is a site of potential hemorrhage and infection. The quicker the defect heals, the better. Triangular Alopecia Triangular alopecia (alopecia triangularis) is a condition similar to congenital aplasia. It is usually apparent from birth and tends to affect a triangular patch of skin and hair above the temples. For unknown reasons, the skin fails to grow hair follicles in this area in a few people. While babies are not born with open ulcers as with aplasia cutis congenita, the long-term result is much the same -- a bald patch where hair does not grow. The affected area can be surgically removed or implanted with hair follicles taken from elsewhere on the scalp. Congenital Atrichia Congenital atrichia or papular atrichia is a unique condition in terms of the hair loss pattern. It was the first human hair loss disease researchers determined was caused by a single gene defect. Although the condition is generally regarded as a hypotrichosis, it is not strictly so. People with congenital atrichia can be born with a full head of hair like any normal baby. But in early childhood they lose all their hair, and it never regrows. Normal hair follicles rely on chemical communication between two basic cells types: modified keratinocytes, which form the outer skin epithelium, and modified fibroblasts, called dermal papilla cells. These two cell groups must ""talk"" to each other through biochemical signals to ensure that hair growth and cycling occurs. The cells must stay in close contact with each other to keep the process going. One cell population cannot grow hair without receiving signals from the other cell population. The mechanism of congenital atrichia is not fully understood, but it seems that as the hair follicles enter their first resting (telogen) state in early childhood, the two cell types get separated from each other. The epithelial cell component of the hair follicle retracts, as it should when hair follicles go into the resting phase of the hair cycle. Normally the dermal papilla cells would also go with the retracting epithelial cells, keeping in close contact, but in congenital atrichia they don't. Instead the dermal papilla cells get left behind deep in the skin and too far away from the epithelial cells to talk to them. Without this communication a new anagen growth phase cannot occur and hair never grows again. While congenital atrichia is genetic and runs in families, it is a gene defect that can spontaneously develop in some embryos born to parents who do not have the condition. Some people diagnosed with alopecia universalis have congenital atrichia instead. Published on March 1, 2010"
15,Dwarfism,"What Is Dwarfism? Dwarfism is when a person is short in stature because of their genes or a medical reason. It’s defined by the advocacy groups Little People of the World Organization (LPOTW) and Little People of America (LPA) as an adult height of 4 feet 10 inches or under, as a result of a medical or genetic condition. Other groups extend the criteria for certain forms of dwarfism to 5 feet, but the average height of an adult with dwarfism is 4 feet. There are two main categories of dwarfism -- disproportionate and proportionate . Disproportionate dwarfism is characterized by an average-size torso and shorter arms and legs or a shortened trunk with longer limbs. In proportionate dwarfism, the body parts are in proportion but shortened. Dwarfism Symptoms In addition to short stature, dwarfism has many other symptoms that can vary depending the type it is. Disproportionate dwarfism symptoms Disproportionate dwarfism usually doesn’t affect intellectual development unless a child has other rare conditions, including hydrocephalus , or excess fluid around the brain . Symptoms of disproportionate dwarfism may include: Adults typically are about 4 feet tall Average-size torso and very short limbs, especially in the upper halves of arms and legs Short fingers Wide spaces between the middle and ring fingers Limited elbow mobility Disproportionately large head Prominent forehead Flattened bridge of the nose Bowing of legs that progressively worsens over time Swaying of the back that progressively worsens over time Some people with disproportionate dwarfism have a rare disorder called spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita (SEDC). Adults with SEDC are around 3 to 4 feet tall and may have these signs too: Very short trunk Short neck, arms, and legs, but average-size hands and feet Broad chest Flattened cheekbones Cleft palate , or an opening in the roof of the mouth Unstable neck bones Deformed hips where the thigh bones turn inward Twisted feet Hunched upper back that progressively worsens Swayed lower back that progressively worsens Arthritis Joint mobility problems Impaired vision or hearing Proportionate dwarfism symptoms Proportionate dwarfism is caused by a medical condition you have at birth or that develops in childhood that hinders growth and development. One common cause is too-low amounts of growth hormone produced by your pituitary gland. Symptoms of proportionate dwarfism include a smaller head, arms, and legs. But all are in proportion with each other. Organ systems may be smaller too. Other signs of proportionate dwarfism in children are: Slower growth rate than expected for their age Height lower than the third percentile on standard charts for age Delayed or no sexual development during the teen years Dwarfism Causes There are approximately 400 types of dwarfism. Causes of proportionate dwarfism include metabolic and hormonal disorders such as growth hormone deficiency. The most common types of dwarfism, known as skeletal dysplasias, are genetic. Skeletal dysplasias are conditions of abnormal bone growth that cause disproportionate dwarfism. They include: Achondroplasia. The most common form of dwarfism -- accounting for 70% of cases -- achondroplasia occurs in about one out of 26,000 to 40,000 babies and is evident at birth. People with achondroplasia have a relatively long trunk and shortened upper parts of their arms and legs. Other features of achondroplasia include: A large head with a prominent forehead A flattened bridge of the nose Protruding jaw Crowded and misaligned teeth Forward curvature of the lower spine Bowed legs Flat, short, broad feet ""Double-jointedness"" Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasias (SED). A less common form of dwarfism, SED affects approximately one in 95,000 babies. Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia refers to a group of conditions characterized by a shortened trunk, which may not become apparent until a child is between ages 5 and 10. Other features can include: Club feet Cleft palate Severe osteoarthritis in the hips Weak hands and feet Barrel-chested appearance Diastrophic dysplasia.A rare form of dwarfism, diastrophic dysplasia occurs in about one in 100,000 births. People who have it tend to have shortened forearms and calves (this is known as mesomelic shortening). Other signs can include Deformed hands and feet Limited range of motion Cleft palate Ears with a cauliflower appearance Turner syndrome. This genetic condition only affects females. It’s caused by a missing or partial X chromosome. Girls with Turner syndrome only inherit one fully functioning X chromosome from their parents, instead of one from each parent. Dwarfism Genetics Skeletal dysplasia is caused by a genetic mutation. The gene mutation can occur spontaneously or can be inherited. Diastrophic dysplasia and usually spondyloepiphyseal dysplasias are inherited in a recessive manner. This means a child must receive two copies of the mutated gene -- one from the mother, one from the father -- to be affected. Achondroplasia , on the other hand, is inherited in a dominant manner. That means a child needs only one copy of the mutated gene to have that form of skeletal dysplasia. There is a 25% chance that a child born to a couple in which both parents have achondroplasia will be of normal height. But there is also a 25% chance the child will inherit both dwarfism genes, a condition known as double-dominant syndrome. This is a fatal condition that usually results in miscarriage . Often parents of children with achondroplasia do not carry the mutated gene themselves. The mutation in the child occurs spontaneously at the time of conception . Doctors do not know what causes a gene to mutate. It is a seemingly random occurrence that can happen in any pregnancy . When average-size parents have a child with dwarfism due to a spontaneous mutation, it is not likely that other children will also have the mutation. In addition to genetic skeletal dysplasia, short stature has other causes, including disorders of the pituitary, which influence growth and metabolism ; kidney disease ; and problems that affect the body's ability to absorb nutrients. Dwarfism Diagnosis Some forms of dwarfism are evident in utero, at birth, or during infancy and can be diagnosed through X-rays and a physical exam. A diagnosis of achondroplasia, diastrophic dysplasia, or spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia can be confirmed through genetic testing . In some cases, prenatal testing is done if there is concern for specific conditions. Sometimes dwarfism doesn't become evident until later in a child's life, when dwarfism signs lead parents to seek a diagnosis. Here are signs and symptoms to look for in children that indicate a potential for dwarfism: A larger head Late development of certain motor skills, such as sitting up or walking Breathing problems Curvature of the spine Bowed legs Joint stiffness and arthritis Lower back pain numbness in the legs Crowding of teeth Doctors may also use these tests to help diagnose dwarfism: Appearance. Children with possible dwarfism may have changes to their skeleton or facial structures as they develop. Chart comparisons. At regular check-ups, your child’s height, weight, and head circumference will be measured and compared to percentiles for standard development for their age. If your child shows any signs of abnormal growth, they may need more frequent measurements. Imaging. Doctors may spot signs of achondroplasia, such as shorter limbs, or other causes of dwarfism on ultrasounds of a fetus during pregnancy. X-rays of babies or children may show that their arms or legs are not growing at a normal rate, or that their skeleton shows signs of dysplasia. MRI scans can show any abnormalities of the pituitary gland or hypothalamus, which affect hormone production. Genetic testing. DNA tests may be done before or after birth to look for genetic mutations linked to dwarfism. Girls with suspected Turner syndrome may need DNA tests to check their X chromosomes. DNA testing may help parents with family planning if they wish to have more children. Family history . Pediatricians may check the height and size of other family members, such as siblings, to compare with the child with suspected dwarfism. Hormone tests. Tests of growth hormone levels can confirm if they’re low. Dwarfism Treatments Early diagnosis and treatment can help prevent or lessen some of the problems associated with dwarfism. People with dwarfism related to growth hormone deficiency can be treated with growth hormone. For children five years of age and older with achondroplasia who still have the potential for growth, the FDA has approved vosoritide ( Voxzogo ) to help stimulate bone growth. In many cases, people with dwarfism have orthopaedic or medical complications. Treatment of those can include: Insertion of a shunt to drain excess fluid and relieve pressure on the brain A tracheotomy to improve breathing through small airways Corrective surgeries for deformities such as cleft palate, club foot, or bowed legs Surgery to remove tonsils or adenoids to improve breathing problems related to large tonsils, small facial structures, and/or a small chest Surgery to widen the spinal canal (the opening through which the spinal cord passes) to relieve spinal cord compression Extended limb lengthening, a controversial surgery, due in part to its risks, involves several procedures. It is only done on adults. Other treatment may include: Physical therapy to strengthen muscles and increase joint range of motion Back braces to improve curvature of the spine Placement of drainage tubes in the middle ear to help prevent hearing loss due to repeated ear infections Orthodontic treatment to relieve crowding of teeth caused by a small jaw Nutritional guidance and exercise to help prevent obesity, which can aggravate skeletal problems Dwarfism Complications Disproportionate dwarfism causes changes to the limbs, back, and head size that could cause complications like these: Arthritis Back pain or breathing difficulties due to hunched or swayed back Bowed legs Crowded teeth Delayed motor skills development Frequent ear infections and possibly hearing loss Hydrocephalus (fluid on the brain) Pressure on the spine at the base of the skull Sleep apnea Spinal stenosis, a narrowing of the spine that may cause leg pain or numbness Weight gain that may cause back problems Proportionate dwarfism may cause you to have smaller or less developed organs. Girls with Turner syndrome may have heart problems. Kids with lower growth hormone levels or Turner syndrome may have emotional or social problems due to delays in sexual development. Women with disproportionate dwarfism may have pregnancy complications, such as respiratory problems. They almost always need to deliver their babies by C-section, as the shape of their pelvis makes vaginal delivery too difficult. Anyone with dwarfism may encounter people who call them names or don’t understand their condition. Kids with dwarfism who have lower self-esteem may need emotional support from their parents to deal with their feelings."
16,Achalasia: What You Should Know,"What Is Achalasia? Achalasia happens when the processes that move food to your stomach don’t work like they should. For food and liquids to pass from your mouth to your stomach, two things have to happen after you swallow. First, the esophagus, the tube that carries food to your stomach, has to move the food along by squeezing and relaxing. Once the food reaches the stomach, a small muscle flap or valve at the bottom of the esophagus must open to let the food empty into the stomach. If you have achalasia, neither of these processes works well. The esophagus can’t push food down. Also, the valve doesn’t open up completely. This causes food to get caught at the base of the esophagus, like a clogged sink, and wash up back into your mouth. Achalasia is rare. Approximately 1 in 100,000 people will get it. It can take years to develop, and some people ignore the symptoms for years before they go to a doctor.  Although the condition can’t be cured, treatment will help you live with it. Achalasia Causes Experts aren’t sure why achalasia happens. But possible causes are: It’s passed down from your parents (genetics) Autoimmune problems A viral infection A loss of nerve function (neurodegenerative) Achalasia Risk Factors People of all races can get achalasia. It’s found equally in men and women. It mainly happens in people 30 to 60 years old, although sometimes children have it. Achalasia is sometimes seen in people with Down syndrome. Achalasia Symptoms The biggest symptom of achalasia is trouble swallowing liquids and solid food. People with the condition may also have: Chest pain , especially after eating Food coming back up into the throat Heartburn and belching Weight loss Nighttime coughing Vomiting Pneumonia from breathing food into the lungs Eating within 4 hours of going to bed may make symptoms worse. Foods such as meat and bread may also cause trouble. Achalasia Diagnosis Because the symptoms of achalasia are so much like heartburn , your doctor may treat you for heartburn first. If that doesn’t work, they probably will test you for achalasia. They may look down into your throat with a special tool called an endoscope . It has a tiny camera attached to a long tube so the doctor can see down your esophagus. The barium swallow test is a common screening test for achalasia. So is a test called manometry. A doctor runs a thin tube down your throat to test the strength of the esophagus muscles as you take sips of water. It also measures how well your stomach valve works. Achalasia Treatment Surgery Surgery is the most successful achalasia treatment. With surgery, most people will get long-term relief from symptoms. The most common procedure is called a Heller myotomy. Most of the time it’s done using a scope with a camera and a light, along with other instruments. The doctor makes several tiny cuts into the abdomen , and uses the surgical tools to reach the area they need to work on. The goal of the operation is to open part of the lower esophagus to make swallowing easier. It’s usually very successful. Another surgical option is called peroral endoscopic myotomy, or POEM. With this procedure, doctors don’t have to cut outside the body. Instead, the doctor inserts an endoscope (a small tool with a camera on the end) into the mouth and down the throat. Once they see inside, they make a small cut to the internal lining of your esophagus. They tunnel through it to reach the inner muscle of the lower esophagus, where they make another cut. This helps make swallowing easier. Both these surgeries are usually successful. But they can cause acid reflux in some people who have it done. Your doctor will discuss which procedure might be best for you. Other Treatments You may not need surgery for achalasia. There are things that can help, but they usually don’t work as well. And you may need to go in for multiple procedures. Some options are: Injections of muscle-relaxing medicine. Your doctor injects Botox (botulinum toxin) into the tight esophagus muscles. This helps relax the muscles temporarily so you can swallow normally. Stretching the esophagus (pneumatic dilation). The doctor inserts a balloon in the valve between the esophagus and stomach and blows it up to stretch the tight muscles. You might need this procedure several times before it helps. Medication. Two classes of drugs, nitrates and calcium channel blockers, have the effect of relaxing the lower esophageal sphincter. These drugs can decrease symptoms in people with achalasia. Your doctor can also inject a type of drug into the esophagus that will help food go down better. But it only lasts for 6 months to a year. The best treatment for you depends on many different things. Your doctor can help you decide what you need. Living with Achalasia There is no special diet for the condition, but you may discover on your own which foods pass through your esophagus more easily. Drinking more water with meals may help. Sometimes carbonated drinks like colas help as well. The carbonation seems to help push the food through the esophagus. If your achalasia is severe, a liquid diet may be your best bet for a while. Always talk to your doctor about getting the right nutrients if you’re not eating solid foods. If you lose a lot of weight , make sure to tell your doctor because it could mean you’re malnourished. Some people with achalasia are at risk for cancer of the esophagus. For this reason, it’s very important to have regular visits with your doctor."
17,What Is an Achilles Tendon Injury?,"What Is an Achilles Tendon Injury? An Achilles tendon injury can happen to anyone, whether you're an athlete or just going about your daily life. The Achilles tendon is the largest tendon in your body. It stretches from the bones of your heel to your calf muscles. You can feel it: a springy band of tissue at the back of your ankle and above your heel. It lets you point your toes toward the floor and raise up on your tiptoes. Thanks to its dense fibers, your Achilles tendon is also quite strong, able to withstand the force of up to 1,100 pounds. But because this part of your leg doesn't have great blood flow, it's easy to injure your Achilles tendon. Your doctor might call this tendinitis or tendonitis. It can feel like a burning or stiffness in the lower part of your leg. If the pain is severe, your Achilles tendon may be partly or completely torn. Your Achilles tendon in the biggest, strongest tendon in your body. If you injure it, it often heals on its own, but it will take time. (Photo credit: Sebastian Kaulitzki/Dreamstime) Achilles Tendon Injury Symptoms Some common signs that you've hurt your Achilles tendon include: Tight Achilles tendon in the morning Stiffness or pain along your Achilles tendon Pain that gets worse with activity Heel pain when you wear shoes Severe pain the day after physical activity Thickening Bone spurs (bony growths) Swelling that doesn't go away, or gets better then returns Achilles tendon pain The most obvious sign of an Achilles tendon injury is pain above your heel, especially when you stretch your ankle or stand on your toes. It may be mild and get better or worse over time. If your Achilles tendon tears, or ruptures, the pain will start all of a sudden and can be severe. It's best to see a doctor right away if this happens. Achilles tendon lump It's common to get a lump on your Achilles tendon after you hurt it. Sometimes this is due to swelling, and can be a sign of moderate Achilles tendinitis. If it's been there for a while, it could also mean that the area is trying to heal. Types of Achilles Tendon Injuries There are two main types of tendinitis that affect different parts of your tendon: Noninsertional Achilles tendinitis. In this type of injury, fibers in the middle of your tendon break down, swell, and get thick. It's more common in very active people, especially runners. Insertional Achilles tendinitis. This affects the lower part of your heel, where your tendon inserts, or goes into, your heel bone. It's more likely to cause bone spurs . Although insertional Achilles tendinitis is also common in runners, it can happen to anyone, even if you're not very active. It's often due to tight calf muscles, which put more stress on your Achilles tendon. You can have one of these types of tendinitis, or both at the same time. Other Achilles tendon injuries include: Achilles bursitis At the back of your heel is a fluid-filled sac called a bursa. It cushions your Achilles tendon when it slides over your heel bone. If you overuse your ankle or foot, this bursa can become irritated and inflamed. It could also happen because of a health issue like arthritis or gout, or if you wear shoes that are too tight and rub against your heel. Another name for Achilles bursitis is retrocalcaneal bursitis. Achilles tendon rupture If your Achilles tendon tears in half or comes off your heel bone, you may hear a snapping or popping noise when it happens. This is an Achilles rupture and is different than tendinitis. The pain is often instant and severe. You could have bruising and swelling. You may also have trouble pointing your toes and pushing off your toes when you take a step. Achilles tendinitis vs. tendinosis These conditions sound similar,  but they're not the same. Achilles tendonitis or tendinitis means that your tendons are inflamed. It's a short-term condition. Achilles tendinosis means that you have ongoing, or long-term, tendinitis. The cells in your tendons have started to break down, which can alter how well your Achilles tendon functions. Achilles Tendon Injury Causes Achilles tendon injuries are common if you do activities where you quickly speed up, slow down, or pivot, such as: Running Gymnastics Dance Football Soccer Baseball Softball Basketball Tennis Volleyball These injuries tend to happen when you start moving suddenly as you push off and lift your foot rather than when you land. For instance, a sprinter might get hurt at the start of a race as they surge off the starting block. The abrupt action can be too much for your tendon to handle. You can also injure your Achilles tendon if you stress it over and over again with high-impact activities. These are known as repetitive stress injuries. But you don't have to be an athlete to get this kind of injury. If you step into a hole or fall from a high place, you could rupture your Achilles. The Achilles tendon is the strongest tendon in the body, but is vulnerable to injury due to its limited blood supply and the high tensions placed on it. (Photo Credit: WebMD) Achilles Tendon Injury Risks Many factors make you more likely to get an Achilles tendon injury: You wear high heels, which can stress the tendon. You have ""flat feet,"" also called fallen arches . This means that when you take a step, the impact causes the arch of your foot to collapse, stretching the muscles and tendons. Your leg muscles or tendons are very tight. You have bone spurs. You add time to your exercise routine or do more intense activity. You start a new type of exercise. You wear shoes that don't fit well or aren't right for the kind of physical activity you do. You work out on uneven surfaces. You take medicines called glucocorticoids or antibiotics called fluoroquinolones. You have a chronic condition that can weaken your Achilles, like rheumatoid arthritis , lupus , gout , or diabetes . Your risk of a ruptured Achilles tendon is higher if you are: Assigned male at birth Between 30 and 40 years old Doing a sport that involves a lot of running and jumping Getting steroid shots in your ankle (it may weaken the nearby Achilles tendon) Carrying extra weight Achilles Tendon Injury Diagnosis Doctors sometimes mistake an Achilles tendon injury for a sprained ankle . To make the right diagnosis, your doctor will start with a physical exam. They may want to see you walk or run so they can look for an issue that might have led to your injury. They also might do something called the calf squeeze test. You'll kneel on a chair or bench or lie on your stomach on the exam table. Your doctor will gently squeeze the calf muscle on your healthy leg. This will pull on the tendon and make your foot move. Next, they'll do the same thing on your other leg. If your Achilles tendon is torn, your foot won't move because your calf muscle won't be connected to your foot. Your doctor may test your range of motion to see if you can move your ankle the way you should. They may also do imaging tests, such as an X-ray or MRI . These tests can show what kind of tendon damage you have and help them decide on the best treatment for you. Achilles Tendon Injury Treatment Minor to moderate Achilles tendon injuries usually heal on their own. To speed the process, you can: Rest your leg. Avoid putting weight on it as best you can. You may need crutches. Ice it. Ice your injury for up to 20 minutes at a time as needed. Compress your leg. Use an elastic bandage around the lower leg and ankle to keep down swelling. Raise (elevate) your leg. Prop it on a pillow when you're sitting or lying down. Take anti-inflammatory painkillers . Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen and naproxen can help with pain and swelling. Follow the instructions on the label to help prevent side effects, such as bleeding and ulcers. Take them with food. Check with your doctor first if you have any allergies, have an ongoing medical condition, or take any other medication or supplements. If you feel like you need NSAIDs for longer than 7 to 10 days, let your doctor know. Use a heel lift. Your doctor may recommend that you wear an insert in your shoe while you recover. It can help protect your Achilles tendon from further strain. Ask your doctor which heel lift is best for you. Practice stretching and strengthening exercises. Your doctor or physical therapist can recommend ones for you to try. Take part in low-impact activities. When your doctor says it's OK, activities like swimming can help promote healing. Achilles tendinitis brace If your sprain is mild, your doctor may show you how to tape your Achilles tendon. A special flexible bandage called kinesiology tape (KT tape) can take pressure off your Achilles tendon when you're being active. If your injury is severe, your doctor may want you to keep your ankle from moving at all at first. They could fit you for a walking boot, splint, or a cast that keeps your foot flexed down. Or they could suggest a night splint. You'll put it on at bedtime to keep your Achilles tendon stretched while you sleep. Signs to seek care right away An Achilles tendon injury isn't an emergency, but if you have any of the following symptoms, call your doctor for advice or go to an urgent care clinic: You heard a ""pop"" or ""snap"" at the time of the injury. You can't bear weight on your foot or ankle. The pain keeps you up at night. Your leg is swelling. Your foot or ankle turns a different color. Your foot or ankle feels hotter or colder than the rest of your leg. You have signs of an infection (like a high fever or feeling run down). Achilles Tendon Surgery If your Achilles is torn, your doctor may recommend surgery. The younger and more active you are, the more likely that surgery will be the best option. You should have the surgery within 4 weeks of the injury. Your surgeon will make a small incision in the back of your ankle and sew the Achilles back together. Sometimes they'll need to sew other tendons in to make it even stronger. Between 80% and 90% of these operations are successful. Your doctor could decide not to do surgery if you're older and less active, or if you have only a partial tear. The nonsurgical route will involve lots of physical therapy and doing stretches and exercises on your own. You might also have ultrasound or shockwave therapy. You may have to wear a cast, a walking boot, or heel cups to take pressure off the tendon and keep it from moving. You'll have a longer road to full recovery, and you'll run a bigger risk of reinjuring the tendon. Achilles Tendon Injury Recovery Recovery may take months, but it depends on how serious your injury is. Different conditions heal at different speeds. You can still be active while your injury heals. Ask your doctor what's OK to do. But don't rush things. Wait to return to your old level of physical activity until: You can move your leg as easily and freely as your uninjured leg. Your leg feels as strong as your uninjured leg. You don't have any pain in your leg when you walk, jog, sprint, or jump. If you push yourself too much before your Achilles tendon injury fully heals, you could get injured again, and the pain could become a long-lasting problem. You may be able to avoid some of these issues if you replace high-impact sports like running with low-impact workouts. Activities like swimming and cycling put less stress on your tendon. Achilles Tendon Injury Prevention To protect your Achilles tendons, try to: Stretch and strengthen your calves. Take time to warm up and cool down after a workout. Avoid running or doing other types of exercise on uneven surfaces. Increase the length or intensity of your workouts little by little. Wear shoes with good support that fit well. Stop exercising if you feel pain or tightness in the back of your calf or heel. Achilles Tendon Stretches Strengthening your calf muscle takes stress off your Achilles tendon. Stretches like these are easy to do at home, but your doctor can confirm if they're right for you. Calf stretch : Lean into a wall from about an arm's length distance away. Keep one leg straight and your heel on the ground. Place your other leg closer to the wall, bend your knee, and press your hips slightly toward the wall. You should feel a stretch in the back of your straightened leg. Hold for 10 seconds, then switch. Repeat up to 20 times per side. Calf raise: Sit in a chair with your feet flat on the ground. Attempt to lift your heels while keeping the balls of your feet on the floor. Hold for 30 seconds and repeat 5 times. Lower calf strengthener: Stand in front of a counter, your knees slightly bent. Holding onto the counter, slowly rise onto your toes, then lower back down. Aim for 30 reps. Takeaways It's surprisingly easy to injure your Achilles tendon, the large, cord-like tendon that stretches from your heel to your calf muscle--especially if you run. Many strains heal with home care, while more severe injuries may need physical therapy or surgery. Stretching your lower leg and strengthening your calf muscle is the best way to protect your Achilles tendon. Achilles Tendon Injury FAQs How long does it take a strained Achilles tendon to heal? The most common place to injure your Achilles tendon is where it joins your calf muscle. Because this area gets less blood flow than the more muscular part of your leg, it can be slow to heal. You may have symptoms for a few months. If you have an Achilles tendon tear or rupture and need surgery, it could be a year before you're as active as you were before. Following your doctor's advice and working with a physical therapist will be important for your recovery."
18,Acquired Lipodystrophy,"Lipodystrophy is a problem with the way your body uses and stores fat. It's called acquired when you aren't born with it. It often affects the fat that’s just under your skin, so it can change the way you look. It also can cause other changes in your body. Some people with HIV get lipodystrophy (LD-HIV). It may be related to the medicines they take or the disease itself. Other acquired lipodystrophies are: Acquired generalized lipodystrophy (AGL), or Lawrence syndrome Acquired partial lipodystrophy (APL), also called progressive lipodystrophy or Barraquer-Simons syndrome Localized lipodystrophy AGL often shows up in children, but adults can get it, too. APL typically starts around ages 8-10. Both conditions affect girls 3 times more often than boys. Both cause a person to lose fat from their face, so they may look sick or much older than they are. Localized lipodystrophy can happen to anyone at any age. A small dimple of localized lipodystrophy may look odd, but it probably won't cause any other trouble. However, because fat tissue makes the hormone leptin , people with larger areas of acquired lipodystrophy might not have enough of this chemical in their bodies. Leptin tells your body you've eaten enough and to make insulin. Fat could also build up in places it shouldn't, like the blood, heart, liver, and kidneys. Depending on which type of lipodystrophy a person has, it may cause other problems, including diabetes , high cholesterol and triglycerides , liver disease, and kidney failure. Doctors can help you manage these complications. And cosmetic surgery might be an option if looks are a concern. Causes Often, doctors don't know what causes acquired lipodystrophy, but some triggers are: An infection, such as measles , pneumonia, infectious mononucleosis, or hepatitis A disease where your immune system attacks your body (called an autoimmune disease ) Repeated injections in or pressure on the same place on your body An injury For example, people with diabetes who have to inject insulin daily tend to get localized lipodystrophy where they keep giving themselves shots. That's a good reason to change your injection site often. Symptoms While all kinds of acquired lipodystrophy cause a loss of body fat, exactly what that means for each person is different. The type your child has will affect: Where it happens How much fat is lost Other effects on their body AGL . They'll lose fat from under the skin all over their body, including their face, arms, legs, palms, and sometimes the soles of their feet. They could look very muscular, and you’ll be able to see veins under their skin. Kids with AGL are very hungry all the time and grow fast. Adults may have large hands and feet and a strong, square jawbone if their hormone balance is off and they've kept growing. They could have larger than usual sex organs (clitoris and ovaries, penis and testicles). A woman might have irregular periods or none at all. They could have polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). They'll probably have extra hair on their upper lip and chin. Some people with AGL have patches of dark, velvety skin in their underarms, on their neck, around their belly button or nipples, or on their hands and feet. Because of the fat loss, a person may have problems using sugar in their body or controlling their blood sugar and triglyceride levels. They could have a large liver or spleen. APL . This type affects just the upper body, on both sides. It usually starts with their face and moves to their neck, arms, and chest. Localized . This looks like a dent in the skin, but the skin itself seems fine. The size can vary. It could be in one spot or many. There might also be tender or painful bumps. Getting a Diagnosis When you go to the doctor, they'll do a full exam and ask questions about your child’s health: What symptoms have you noticed? When did you first see them? Are changes in how they looks only in certain areas, or all over? Have they had panniculitis -- swollen bumps under their skin or a bumpy red rash? Do they have diabetes? What other health problems or recent injuries have they had? Have you had their blood sugar, cholesterol, and triglyceride levels checked? Tests of body fat can confirm the diagnosis. For a skin biopsy , the doctor will cut a small piece of skin and check the cells under a microscope. Your doctor may also look for a pattern of fat loss with: Skinfold thickness measurements, checking how much skin they can pinch between their fingers at specific spots on their body A special X-ray that measures bone mineral density A special whole-body MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) that uses powerful magnets and radio waves to make pictures showing tissues with fat Blood tests check: Blood sugar Kidney health Fats Liver enzymes Uric acid If the doctor suspects APL, they'll check their blood for evidence of a specific way the body attacks fat cells. Urine tests check for kidney problems. Questions for Your Doctor What type of lipodystrophy is this? Do you know what caused it? Do we need any more tests? How many other people with this condition have you treated? What's the best way for us to treat it? What other symptoms should we watch for? Do we need to see any other doctors? Is there anything I can do that will help my child look and feel ""normal""? Can we be part of a lipodystrophy research trial? Treatment Since you can't replace the missing body fat, your aim will be to avoid complications of the disease. A healthy lifestyle plays a big role. Everyone with lipodystrophy should eat a low-fat diet. But children still need enough calories and good nutrition so they grow properly. Exercise will help your child stay healthy, too. Physical activity lowers blood sugar and can keep fat from building up dangerously. People with AGL may be able to get metreleptin injections (Myalept) to replace the missing leptin and help prevent other diseases. Statins and omega-3 fatty acids, found in some fish, can help control high cholesterol or triglycerides, too. If your child has or gets diabetes, they'll need to take insulin or other drugs to control their blood sugar. Women with AGL shouldn't use oral birth control or hormone replacement therapy for menopause because they can make levels of certain fats worse. Your doctor may prescribe a lotion or cream to lighten and soften dark skin patches. Over-the-counter bleaches and skin scrubs probably won't work and could irritate the skin. As your child gets older, they may be able to get plastic surgery to help fill out their face with skin grafts from their thighs, belly, or scalp. Doctors can also use implants and injections of fillers to help reshape facial features. People with APL who have extra fat deposits can use liposuction to get rid of some, but fat may build up again. Talk to your doctor about what approach for their appearance makes sense and when. Taking Care of Your Child Because this condition affects how you look, care and compassion are as important as medicine. Focus on keeping your child healthy and being supportive. Set the tone for others. Be positive and open-minded. People may not know how to react or what to say to keep from prying, or offending or embarrassing you and your child. When someone asks about them, be matter-of-fact about their condition. Do what you can to boost their self-esteem. Try to focus your praise on achievements, rather than appearance. Encourage friendships. But kids will be kids, so prepare them for unkind looks and words. You can help them practice how they’ll react with role-play and humor. Consider professional counseling . Someone with training can help your child and your family sort out their feelings as they deal with the challenges of this disease. What to Expect Over time, people with AGL can lose most or all of their body fat. With APL, it typically stops after a few years. In general, the more fat you lose, the more serious the condition is. Yet many people with lipodystrophy live active, productive lives. You'll need to work closely with your doctor to prevent complications. For example, people with AGL are likely to have heart and liver problems. Diabetes can be hard to control. They might develop autoimmune disorders such as vitiligo (light-colored spots of skin), rheumatoid arthritis , and a kind of hepatitis. People with APL probably won't have the insulin-related problems that often come with AGL. But it can lead to kidneys that don't work well or at all, and drusen, tiny fat deposits in the back of the eyes that may be connected to age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Women may get extra fat on their hips and thighs. AGL and APL can be linked to autoimmune disorders, too, including rheumatoid arthritis and celiac disease . Researchers are studying lipodystrophy, and they may find more ways to treat it. Getting Support If you're looking for a community, Lipodystrophy United is a good place to start. It has information about the disease as well as an online community for people with lipodystrophy and their families."
19,Acromegaly,"What Is Acromegaly? Acromegaly is a disorder that happens when your body makes too much growth hormone (GH). It causes abnormal growth that usually starts in your hands and feet. GH stimulates growth and development in children. In adults, GH affects energy levels, muscle strength, bone health, and one's sense of well-being. Most people who get acromegaly are middle-aged. Children can have problems with too much growth hormone -- a condition called gigantism. There are treatments for acromegaly, and every case is different. In most cases, it might be years before you notice symptoms. Acromegaly Causes The most common cause is a noncancerous tumor in your pituitary gland. This tumor is called a pituitary adenoma. The pituitary gland is in the skull, just below the brain. Because of the tumor, your body makes too much growth hormone. Once in a while, tumors in the pancreas, liver, or parts of the brain can cause acromegaly by producing higher levels of another hormone, called IGF-1, which causes the symptoms you see. Acromegaly Symptoms Changes happen slowly, sometimes over years. Your hands and feet are usually large. You might notice a change in your ring or shoe size, especially your shoe width. The features in your face -- your lips, jaw, nose, and tongue -- often change, becoming coarser and broader. Your teeth may begin to space out. Your brow and lower jaw may start to jut out from your face. Other symptoms may include: Achy joints, possibly leading to arthritis Stiff, rough body hair Hoarser, deeper voice Pinched nerve problems Skin that’s oily or thick Skin tags Sweating a lot with body odor Headaches Snoring and sleep apnea, a breathing problem that happens during sleep Weakness and being tired Tingling or pain in fingers (carpal tunnel syndrome) Vision problems Lower sex drive Changes in menstrual cycle and breast discharge in women Erectile dysfunction in men Acromegaly Diagnosis The sooner your acromegaly is diagnosed, the better. When you see your doctor, they'll ask you questions like these: What changes have you noticed? When did you first notice the problem? How are you feeling? To tell for sure if you have acromegaly, your doctor will run a few tests, including: A blood test to see if your IGF-1 hormone levels are high for your age. A glucose tolerance test, where your doctor gives you a sugary drink and they measure the sugar and GH levels in your blood over 2 hours.  If your levels don’t drop, this is a sign you could have acromegaly. Other tests include: Checking your prolactin levels, which could be slightly elevated Echocardiogram, an ultrasound of your heart to see if it’s affected A colonoscopy to check if your colon is healthy A sleep study to see if you have sleep apnea X-rays to see if your bones have thickened MRI or CT scans to help find tumors Photos you’ve taken over the years to see any physical changes Questions for Your Doctor If you find out you have acromegaly, you'll probably have a lot of questions. You may want to start by asking your doctor: What is acromegaly? What is causing my acromegaly? What treatment do you recommend? How will treatment change my symptoms? What will success look like? What are the side effects? How many other people with acromegaly have you treated? Am I likely to get this again? Acromegaly Treatment Your doctor will work with you to come up with the best treatment plan, taking into account your age, health, and how far along your condition is. There are three ways to treat acromegaly: Surgery Medicine Radiation Surgery is often the first treatment for people with large tumors affecting important areas, especially if they’re pressing on nerves that harm your vision. The surgeon will remove the tumor from the base of the brain. To get to it, they'll make a small cut in your nose or the inside of your upper lip. In some cases, your doctor may have you take medicine before the surgery to shrink the tumor. After the surgery, your doctor will measure your hormones and will do imaging of the area where the tumor was removed. Your symptoms may start to get better after only a few days. Your doctor may recommend taking one of these medicines after surgery to help control or cure the disease and bring hormone levels back to normal: Somatostatin analogs (lanreotide, octreotide or pasireotide) Growth hormone receptor antagonists (pegvisomant) Dopamine agonists (cabergoline, bromocriptine) Those drugs either lower the level of growth hormone in your blood or block the effects it has on your body. Radiation helps if you have parts of a tumor left after surgery or if you need more help lowering growth hormone levels after taking medicine. It can help stop the tumor from growing and your body from making too much growth hormone. Types of radiation therapy include: Conventional radiation therapy. You get this type of radiation therapy every weekday for 4-6 weeks. It could take 10 or more years for you to recognize this type of therapy’s effect on your body. Proton beam therapy. This type of therapy will send a high dose of radiation directly to the tumor while avoiding the normal tissue. You’ll have several treatments, but the overall treatment time is usually less than conventional radiation therapy. Stereotactic radiosurgery. You’ll get one very high dose of radiation targeted to your tumor cells while avoiding the healthy tissue. This type of therapy could bring your GH levels back to normal in about 5 years. Acromegaly Outlook Your experience with acromegaly will depend on how the condition has affected you. Work closely with your doctor so you understand your options and what you can expect as your treatment moves forward. Ask your doctor questions, and let them know how you're doing and what you're concerned about. Acromegaly Complications If you start acromegaly treatment early, you may not have any complications, or if you do, you can stop them from getting worse. Complications can include: Cardiovascular disease (heart disease) Carpal tunnel syndrome Diabetes Goiter (when your thyroid gland gets bigger) High blood pressure Osteoarthritis, a common form of arthritis Precancerous growths on your colon Sleep apnea, a sleep disorder where you might stop breathing Spinal cord compression Vision loss It’s important to get treatment for acromegaly. Left untreated, you can die from it. Getting Support for Acromegaly When you get diagnosed with a condition like acromegaly, it can help to connect with other people who have it. Ask your doctor if there are local support groups, or consider joining an online support group. If you think it would be helpful to talk with a counselor, your doctor can give you a referral. Let your family and friends know what they can do to support you. They'll want to help, but they may not know what to offer, so be specific about what you would find helpful. To learn more about acromegaly, visit the acromegaly website of the Pituitary Network Association. You can get information there about joining a support group near you."
20,What Is Hirschsprung's Disease?,"It’s a cycle that’s vital to life -- we eat food, digest it, and excrete what we can’t use. Excretion, though often a subject of disgust or humor, is very important. It usually begins on the first day of a baby ’s life, when the newborn passes their first stool, called the meconium. But some babies have trouble. If a baby can’t have a bowel movement , they may have Hirschsprung ’s disease, a condition in which there are missing nerve cells in the large intestine. Hirschsprung’s disease is congenital -- that is, it develops during pregnancy and is present at birth. Some congenital conditions happen because of the mother’s diet , or because of an illness they had during their pregnancy. Others are because of genes the parents pass on to the newborn . Researchers don’t know why some people have Hirschsprung’s disease, though they believe the disease is related to flaws in DNA instructions. Though the disease can be deadly, modern medicine is able to fix the problem with surgery, and help children who have been treated to live relatively normal, healthy lives. What Causes Hirschsprung’s Disease? It begins to take hold in a baby in the early months of pregnancy. Usually, as the baby develops, nerve cells are created throughout the entire digestive system , from the esophagus -- which leads from the mouth to the stomach -- all the way to the rectum. Normally, a person will have up to 500 million of these types of nerve cells. Among other roles, they move food through your digestive system from one end to the other. In a baby with Hirschsprung’s, the nerve cells stop growing at the end of the large intestine, just before the rectum and anus . In some children, the cells are missing at other places in the digestive system as well. That means the body can’t sense when waste material reaches a certain point. So the waste material gets stuck and forms a block in the system. Hirschsprung’s disease affects about one in every 5,000 newborns. Children with other congenital conditions, such as Down syndrome and heart defects, are more likely to have the disease. Parents who carry the code for Hirschsprung’s disease in their genes, especially mothers, may pass it on to their children. Boys get it more than girls. The disease is named after the 19 th -century Danish doctor Harald Hirschsprung, who described the condition in 1888. Symptoms For the vast majority of people with Hirschsprung’s disease, symptoms usually begin within the first 6 weeks of life. In many cases, there are signs within the first 48 hours. You may see swelling in your child’s abdomen . Other symptoms you might see include: No bowel movements: You should be concerned if the newborn does not produce a stool or the meconium in the first couple of days. Older children with Hirschsprung’s may have chronic (ongoing) constipation . Bloody diarrhea : Children with Hirschsprung’s may also get enterocolitis, a life-threatening infection of the colon , and have bad cases of diarrhea and gas . Vomiting : The vomit may be green or brown. In older children, symptoms may include growth issues, fatigue , and severe constipation . Diagnosis and Tests Your doctor should be told at once if your child has these symptoms. They can confirm Hirschsprung’s with some specific tests: A contrast enema: It’s also called a barium enema, after the element in the dye often used to coat and highlight the inside of the body’s organs. Your child is placed face-down on a table while the dye is inserted via a tube from the anus into the intestines . No anesthesia (a medication to numb or block pain ) is necessary. The dye allows the doctor to see problem areas on the X-rays. The contrast enema is done as part of what is called a “lower GI series,” a group of tests on the gastrointestinal tract. An abdominal X-ray: This is a standard X-ray, which the technician may take from several angles. Your doctor will be able to see whether something is blocking the intestines . A biopsy : Your doctor will take a small sample of tissue from your child’s rectum. The tissue will be looked at for signs of Hirschsprung’s. Depending on the age and size of your child, the doctor may use anesthesia. Anorectal manometry: This test inflates a small balloon inside the rectum to see whether the muscles of the area respond. This test is done only on older children. Treatments Hirschsprung’s disease is a very serious condition. But if found quickly, it can help your child live a relatively normal life. Doctors will usually do one of two types of surgery: Pull-through procedure: This surgery simply cuts out the part of the large intestine with the missing nerve cells. Then the rest of the intestine is connected directly to the anus. Ostomy surgery: This surgery routes the intestine to an opening made in the body. The doctor then attaches an ostomy bag to the outside of the opening to hold the waste from the intestine. Ostomy surgery is usually a temporary measure until the child is ready for the pull-through procedure. After surgery, some children may have issues with constipation , diarrhea, or incontinence (lack of control over bowel movements or urination). A handful may get enterocolitis. Signs include rectal bleeding , fever , vomiting , and a swollen abdomen. If that happens, take your child to the hospital at once. But with proper care -- especially a proper diet and plenty of water -- these conditions should subside and most children are able to experience normal bowel movements within a year of treatment. Other children will have bowel issues on and off into adulthood throughout their lives. Because Hirschsprung’s disease is congenital, it means it is a lifelong issue that should be monitored."
21,"Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD): Symptoms, Causes, Treatment","What Is Age-Related Macular Degeneration? Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is an eye disease that may get worse over time. It’s the leading cause of serious, permanent vision loss in people over 50, with about 1 in 10 people in the U.S. affected by the condition. It happens when the central portion of your retina, called the macula, wears down. The retina is the light-sensing nerve tissue at the back of your eye. Because the disease happens as you get older, it’s often called age-related macular degeneration. It usually doesn’t cause blindness but might cause serious vision problems. Another form of macular degeneration, called Stargardt disease or juvenile macular degeneration, affects children and young adults. Symptoms of Age-Related Macular Degeneration Early on, you might not have any noticeable signs of macular degeneration. It might not be diagnosed until it gets worse or affects both eyes. Symptoms of macular degeneration may include: Worse or less clear vision. Your vision might be blurry, and it may be hard to read fine print, drive, or recognize faces. Dark, blurry areas in the center of your vision Straight lines look wavy Worse or different color perception If you have any of these symptoms, see an eye doctor as soon as possible. Learn more about the symptoms of AMD. Types of Age-Related Macular Degeneration There are two main types of age-related macular degeneration: Dry AMD . People with this most common type may have yellow deposits, called drusen, in their macula. A few small drusen may not cause changes in your vision. But as they get bigger and more numerous, they might dim or distort your vision, especially when you read. The condition causes gradual vision loss. As it gets worse, the light-sensitive cells in your macula get thinner and eventually die. In the atrophic form, you may have blind spots in the center of your vision. If that gets worse, you might lose central vision. Wet AMD. This is a less common type of late-stage AMD. It tends to cause faster vision loss. Unstable blood vessels grow from underneath your macula. These blood vessels leak blood and fluid into your retina, distorting your vision. You may also have blind spots and loss of central vision. These blood vessels and their bleeding can eventually form a scar, leading to permanent loss of central vision. Most people with macular degeneration have the dry form, but that can lead to the wet form. Only about 20% of people with macular degeneration have the wet form. If you have macular degeneration, you’ll need to see your eye doctor regularly and let them know whenever you notice changes in your vision. Causes of Age-Related Macular Degeneration Experts aren't sure why some people develop AMD and others don't. They believe that your genes and your environment may play a role. People who get wet AMD always have dry AMD first. But those with dry AMD don't always go on to develop the wet type. Age-Related Macular Degeneration Risk Factors Risk factors for both types of AMD include: Smoking High blood pressure or high cholesterol Eating lots of saturated fat Having obesity Being assigned female at birth Having light skin AMD epidemiology AMD is the leading cause of permanent blindness in the industrialized world (with over 170 million people affected), and the third cause globally. Some other AMD facts and figures: Among different racial groups, non-Hispanic White European people are at highest risk of getting AMD, followed by Hispanic, Black, and Asian people. People over 75 are nearly 15 times more likely to get AMD than those 50-59 years old. Women are slightly more likely than men to get AMD. But this may be simply because they tend to live longer. Age-Related Macular Degeneration Diagnosis Your doctor can check you for age-related macular degeneration when you see them for a routine eye exam and have your eyes dilated. Tests for AMD These tests can help your doctor diagnose the condition: Retinal exam. During your eye exam, the doctor will examine your retina. They'll look for drusen under the retina. Amsler grid. Your doctor may also ask you to look at an Amsler grid, a pattern of straight lines that's like a checkerboard. If some of the lines appear wavy or are missing, that could be a sign of macular degeneration. Angiography. If your doctor finds AMD, you may have a procedure called angiography or one called o ptical coherence tomography ( OCT). In angiography, your doctor injects dye into a vein in your arm. They take photographs as the dye flows through blood vessels in your retina. If there are new vessels, or if vessels are leaking fluid or blood in your macula, the photos will show their location and type. OCT is an imaging scan that can show fluid or blood underneath your retina without dye. It’s important to see your eye doctor regularly to find signs of macular degeneration early. Treatment can slow the condition or make it less serious. Learn more about how AMD is diagnosed . Stages of Age-Related Macular Degeneration There are three stages for dry AMD: Early. In this stage, you have no symptoms. Intermediate. Some people have no symptoms in this stage. Or, you may notice minor symptoms like central vision blurriness or trouble seeing things in dim light. Late. In this stage, you will likely start to see straight lines as wavy. You may also have blurring in the center of your vision that can expand or get worse over time. Colors may look less bright, and it's even harder to see in low light. Wet AMD is always considered late stage. But dry AMD may turn into the wet form during any stage. Age-Related Macular Degeneration Treatment Treatment may slow the condition down and help preserve your vision. But there’s no cure for macular degeneration. Supplements and Medications for AMD Right now, there are no medicines or procedures for dry AMD. Your treatment options include: Supplements. A large study by the National Eye Institute, called AREDS (Age-Related Eye Disease Study), found that a certain combination of vitamins and nutrients may protect the eyes of some people with intermediate or late-stage AMD. The supplements may slow intermediate AMD's progression to advanced and might help some people keep their sight longer, too. Researchers later tweaked the formula, giving it the name AREDS2. If you have a lot of drusen in your eyes, your doctor might recommend you take AREDS2 supplements. If you’ve lost vision in one eye, the supplements may also lower your chances of getting wet AMD and vision loss in your other eye. AREDS2 supplements are sold over the counter. They're a combination of: Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) Vitamin E, lutein, zeaxanthin, and zinc (as zinc oxide) Copper (as cupric oxide) These supplements don’t help everyone with dry AMD, though. Ask your eye doctor if they might be right for you. If your doctor gives you the green light, ask them to recommend a brand. Also ask your doctor to explain all the possible benefits and risks before you start taking the supplements. They may be part of some people’s treatment for wet AMD, too. These supplements don't work to prevent AMD, so there's no need to take them if you don't have the condition. If you have wet AMD, your treatments might include: Anti-angiogenesis drugs. These medications block the creation of blood vessels and leaking from the vessels in your eye that cause wet AMD. You usually get them as injections into your eye. The main protein causing that growth is vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). VEGF inhibitors include: aflibercept ( Eylea ), bevacizumab ( Avastin ), pegaptanib (Macugen), and ranibizumab ( Lucentis ). Blocking angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2), another protein involved in forming blood vessels, helps stabilize fragile new vessels so they don't leak. It also makes vessels less sensitive to the effects of VEGF. VEGF/Ang-2 inhibitors include: Faricimab-svoa ( Vabysmo ). Many people who’ve taken these drugs got back some vision that was lost. You might need to have these treatments multiple times. Procedures for AMD Several options are available for AMD: Laser therapy. High-energy laser light can destroy abnormal blood vessels growing in your eye. Photodynamic laser therapy. Your doctor injects a light-sensitive drug – verteporfin ( Visudyne ) – into your bloodstream, and it’s absorbed by the abnormal blood vessels. Your doctor then shines a laser into your eye to trigger the medication to damage those blood vessels. Researchers are also studying experimental treatments for age-related macular degeneration. They include: Submacular surgery. This procedure removes abnormal blood vessels or blood. Retinal translocation. This destroys abnormal blood vessels under the center of your macula, where your doctor can’t use a laser beam safely. In this procedure, your doctor moves the center of your macula away from the abnormal blood vessels to a healthy area of your retina. This keeps you from getting scar tissue and more damage to your retina. Then, your doctor uses a laser to treat the abnormal blood vessels. Alternative options for AMD There's no scientific proof that any type of alternative treatments work for AMD, and they can't replace medical treatments. But some people use supplements or alternative therapies along with standard treatments. Always ask your doctor before you try an alternative treatment, as some could interact with your medications or cause side effects. Herbs. Among the herbs that may have some benefits to eye health are: Gingko. This herb contains flavonoids, a substance known to promote eye health. A couple of studies found that people who took gingko were able to slow down vision loss. Milk thistle. Milk thistle contains a substance called silymarin that's good for your liver. Because your liver stores certain vitamins, it plays a role in eye health. Bilberry and grape seeds. These are also high in flavonoids. Alternative therapies. While there's no real evidence to show these practices are effective, some people try them for AMD symptoms: Acupuncture. This treatment involves placing tiny needles into specific points of your body. Some people who practice acupuncture think it helps with AMD by increasing blood flow to the eyes. Microcurrent stimulation. This involves applying a slight electric current in the area around your eyes. The idea is that it could help cells in the retina get rid of waste products Find out more about the latest treatment options for AMD. Age-Related Macular Degeneration Health Disparities While White people of European descent appear more likely to get AMD than other groups, anyone can get it. Research has found differences in how people of color are diagnosed with and treated for the condition. Studies have shown that Black people with AMD were 23% less likely than White AMD patients to be treated with anti-VEGF injections, the main treatment for dry AMD. Latino and Asian American people are also less likely to be given this treatment. Studies also show that Black people are 18% less likely than their White counterparts to get regular eye exams, which are important for detecting AMD. Other research shows that people of color are under-represented in clinical studies of new treatments for eye diseases. The rate at which Black people take part has been decreasing over the past 20 years, even as more Latino and Asian people take part. The reasons for these disparities aren't clear, but may involve a number of things, including access to health care, cultural mistrust of the health care system, and bias. Complications of Age-Related Macular Degeneration Age-related macular degeneration doesn't cause total blindness, even though it can affect central vision and cause permanent damage to your eye. Your vision loss might make it hard to: Drive Read Recognize faces Do household tasks like cooking or yardwork Serious AMD can cause you to become legally blind. Living with Age-Related Macular Degeneration When you have AMD, you may need to seek help or change the way you do some of your everyday activities. But with the right support, you should be able to remain independent and maintain a good quality of life. AMD and diet When you're diagnosed with AMD, your doctor may tell you to eat a balanced diet that’s rich in antioxidants and includes eye-friendly foods like: Fish high in omega-3 fatty acids such as salmon, anchovies, mackerel, and trout (aim for two to three times weekly) Nuts, which are rich in vitamin E, selenium, and zinc (about a handful weekly) Dark leafy greens like kale and spinach (daily) Yellow/orange veggies like peppers and carrots (daily) Antioxidant-rich fruits, like berries (daily) Costs of AMD AMD can bring extra costs in several areas, including: Doctor visits, treatments, and vision therapy Low-vision aids and technology Home modifications Pay for caregivers Lost productivity at work AMD treatments can be expensive, though how much you pay out-of-pocket depends on your insurance. Without insurance, a 2-year course of treatment could cost between $9,000 and $65,000 per year, depending on what your doctor prescribes. Some drug companies and other groups offer programs to help low-income people with the costs. Managing AMD Some things that can help you adapt to the vison limits that may come with AMD include: Low-vision aids. These include devices that have special lenses or electronic systems to create larger images of nearby things. They help people who have vision loss from dry or wet macular degeneration make the most of their remaining vision. Your doctor may also prescribe glasses or contacts to help you see better. Better lighting. Bright, consistent lighting throughout your environment helps with things like reading and cooking, and also helps prevent falls. Vision rehabilitation. A low-vision specialist can help you learn to make the most of your side (peripheral) vision and rely more on your other senses. They can help you learn to use low-vision devices and provide advice tailored to your own needs. Mental health and AMD Any illness can be distressing, especially one that could cause major changes in your everyday life. If your AMD causes you to lose central vision, you're at higher risk of becoming depressed or socially isolated. Your doctor can recommend a therapist, counselor, or social worker or help you find a support group. Family and friends can also provide emotional support as well as help you take care of everyday tasks. Macular Degeneration Prognosis Macular degeneration usually gets worse over time. But n ot everyone who has AMD develops it in both eyes or progresses to the late stages. The dry form of age-related macular degeneration tends to progress slowly over a period of years. The wet type, though, can come on suddenly. Since early treatment can help keep symptoms from getting worse, it's important to have regular doctor appointments and eye exams. Wet macular degeneration will likely need repeated treatments. If you don't get follow-up treatments often enough, your vision may get worse than before you started treatment . What to expect with AMD Most people with AMD will maintain good eyesight. Even those who lose central vision usually keep their side vision. Talk to your doctor about how your condition might progress. If you develop advanced AMD, you might lose your ability to do things that require sharp eyesight, like driving or reading. Age-Related Macular Degeneration Prevention If you don’t have AMD, you can practice some healthy habits that may help you lower your chances of getting it: If you smoke, consider quitting. Take charge of any other health conditions you have, like high blood pressure. Stay at a healthy weight and get regular exercise. Eat a balanced diet full of fruit, vegetables, and foods with omega-3 fatty acids (which are in certain fish and nuts). Conditions That Are Similar to Age-Related Macular Degeneration Some other eye conditions have symptoms similar to those of AMD, including: Macular hole. This is a small hole that forms in the macula, leading to distorted vision. Myopic macular degeneration. This only affects people with serious myopia (nearsightedness). Stargardt disease. This is also known as juvenile macular degeneration. It's a hereditary condition that affects young people. Diabetic retinopathy. This is a complication of diabetes that causes damage to blood vessels in the retina. Takeaways Having age-related macular degeneration doesn't mean you'll lose your sight. Timely treatment and healthy lifestyle changes can help protect your central vision. Even if you do lose some vision, steps like low-vision aids and therapy can help you stay independent and keep doing the things you enjoy."
22,What's Normal Aging?,"You have a lot of say-so in how you feel as you grow older -- from your heart and eyes to your skin and bones. You can enjoy a better body by knowing what’s natural as you age and what’s not and by learning simple steps you can try to delay or lessen the changes. Your Heart Works Harder As you get older, your blood vessels and arteries become stiffer. Your heart has to work harder to pump blood. This can lead to high blood pressure and other heart problems. Try this : Stay active. Walk, run, swim -- even a little moderate exercise each day can help you stay at a good weight and keep your blood pressure down. Eat lots of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains to keep your heart healthy.  Manage stress. Get enough sleep. 7 to 8 hours of rest each night can help repair and heal your heart and blood vessels. Your Skin Feels Different You might notice that your skin feels drier and less supple than it once did. That’s because your skin makes less natural oil as you age. Also, you sweat less, and you lose some of the fatty tissue just below the skin. This can make it seem thinner. You may also notice wrinkles, age spots, and skin tags, or tiny growths of skin. Try this: Hot water dries skin out, so take warm baths and showers. Wear sunscreen and protective clothing when you’re outdoors. Check your skin often and tell your doctor if you notice changes, such as moles. If you smoke, this is another good reason to try to stop. It can cause wrinkles. You Find It Harder to See and Hear You may find it hard to focus on objects up close. You might need reading glasses for the first time. Perhaps you see more glare or find it hard to adapt to abrupt changes of light. When it comes to your hearing, you could have a hard time following conversations in a crowded room or hearing at high frequencies. Try this: Get your vision and hearing checked regularly. Wear sunglasses to protect your eyes outdoors. Wear earplugs to protect against or block loud noises. Your Teeth and Gums Change You might notice your gums seem to pull away from your teeth. Some medicines make your mouth feel drier. Dry mouth might put you at higher risk for tooth decay and infections. Try this : Each day, brush twice and floss once to get rid of food and plaque between your teeth. It’s the best way to help prevent gum disease and tooth loss. Also, see your dentist for regular checkups and cleanings. Your Bones Become More Brittle As early as your 40s and 50s, your bones begin to weaken. They become less dense and more brittle. This increases your risk of fracture. You might even notice you seem to be shorter. In fact, beginning in your 40s, you might get shorter by 1 to 2 inches. That happens when the disks in your spine shrink. Your joints might feel stiffer. Fluid and cartilage that line the joints can decrease or wear away with age. As the tissues between your joints break down, you may develop arthritis. Try this : Make sure you get enough calcium and vitamin D. Good sources of calcium in your diet include dairy products, almonds, and vegetables such as broccoli and kale. Your doctor may also recommend calcium supplements. Vitamin D is vital to bone health because it helps the body absorb calcium and maintain bone strength.. Some people are able to get enough of this nutrient by spending time in sunlight. You can also get it from tuna, sardines, egg yolks, and fortified foods such as milk and many cereals. Ask your doctor whether you need a supplement. Going to the Bathroom You might find it harder to control your bladder. This is called “urinary incontinence.” It happens to an estimated 10% of people 65 or older. Many of these people get a little leakage when they cough or sneeze, but some lose a large amount of pee before they can get to the bathroom.  For women, menopause can be a factor. For men, an enlarged prostate might be the issue. You might also notice that you’re not as regular as you used to be. Some conditions, such as diabetes, can slow down your bowels. Some medicines might make you constipated. These include medicines that treat blood pressure, seizures, Parkinson disease, and depression. Iron supplements and narcotic pain medicines can also lead to constipation. Try this : If you get the urge to “go” a lot, see your doctor. In most cases, symptoms can be controlled or even cured. Try to avoid caffeine, alcohol, sodas, and foods high in acid. These can make the condition worse. Kegel exercises can tighten your pelvic floor muscles and may help with bladder control. Squeeze as if you’re holding your pee. Wait five seconds, then relax for five seconds. Do this four or five times in a row several times a day. To avoid constipation, eat plenty of high-fiber foods such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Drink lots of water. Try to exercise every day. It can help get your bowels moving. It’s Harder Getting Around or Staying Strong As we age, we lose muscle mass, and that can lead to weakness and reduced activity. Try this : Get some moderate exercise every day, such as a brisk walk or lifting light weights. It will help with muscle strength and function. Check with your doctor to see how much activity is right for you. Eat lots of fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins such as fish and chicken. Stay away from sugar and foods that are high in saturated fat. And eat smaller portions. You probably don’t need as many calories as you once did. Your Sex Life Changes, Too During menopause, a woman’s vaginal tissues become drier, thinner, and less elastic. It might make sex less pleasurable. Breasts lose tissue and fat and can seem smaller and less full. As men age, they may find it harder to get or keep an erection. This may be due to other health conditions as well as side effects of treatments. Try this : Talk to your doctor. They can prescribe medications to ease physical symptoms or ramp up your desire for sex. We can’t turn the clock backward. But with patience, care, and smart lifestyle changes, we can make the most of our bodies as we age."
23,Myelofibrosis,"What Is Myelofibrosis? Myelofibrosis is a rare kind of blood cancer that starts in your marrow, a spongy tissue inside your bones that makes blood cells. The disease causes scars called fibrosis, which affects how many blood cells your body can make. Symptoms of Myelofibrosis Myelofibrosis is long-lasting and usually gets worse slowly. You may be able to live with it for years without a problem. But some people’s condition changes more quickly and causes symptoms that need to be treated. These include: Fatigue , weakness, shortness of breath, or pale skin because of a low number of red blood cells ( anemia ) Frequent infections because of a low white blood cell count (neutropenia) Easy bleeding or bruising because of a lack of platelets in your blood (thrombocytopenia) Swollen liver (hepatomegaly) or spleen (splenomegaly) Night sweats Itchy skin Fever Bone or joint pain Weight loss Blood clots Bleeding in your stomach or esophagus High blood pressure in the vein from your spleen to your liver (portal hypertension) Causes of Myelofibrosis A problem with one of your genes causes your body to make stem cells that don’t work the way they should. These are the cells that make blood in your bone marrow. With myelofibrosis, they get inflamed, and scar tissue forms. About 90% of people who get this kind of cancer have a change in one of three genes: JAK2, CALR, or MPL. These genes change during your lifetime, but experts don’t know why. In most cases, you don’t get these gene problems from your parents, and you don’t pass them on to your children. These faulty genes make copies of themselves. The bad versions spread through your marrow and try to stop your body from making regular blood cells. There’s no way to prevent myelofibrosis. But researchers are trying to learn more about it. Risk Factors for Myelofibrosis Most people are diagnosed around age 60. About 18,000 people in the U.S. are living with myelofibrosis. Young adults or small children can get myelofibrosis, but it’s rare. Girls are affected twice as often as boys when it happens in childhood. You may get myelofibrosis by itself. Or it could happen if you have another type of cancer that spreads to your marrow. Blood cancers like leukemia or myeloma could also bring it on. Long-term exposure to radiation or toxic chemicals like benzene could make you more likely to get myelofibrosis. But that doesn’t happen often. Myelofibrosis Effects on the Body Blood cells. You have three types. They travel from your marrow to the rest of your body. Each has a special job to do. But if myelofibrosis slows production, that can’t happen. Red blood cells bring oxygen to your organs and tissues like your muscles. If you have too few, you might feel weak, short of breath, lightheaded, or really tired. You might have bone pain. White blood cells help you fight off infections. If you have too many, your body can’t defend you from illness like it’s supposed to. Platelets make your blood clot when you get a cut so you can form a scab and heal. Without enough working platelets, it may be hard for you to stop bleeding. Organs. Because your marrow has problems making blood cells, organs like your spleen, liver, or lungs may start the process instead. You could also make blood cells in your spinal cord or lymph nodes -- small glands in your groin, neck, and armpits. All that extra blood can cause organs to get too large, especially your spleen . You might feel pain or fullness in your belly if that happens. This can be serious, so you need to get it looked at right away. Diagnosis of Myelofibrosis No one test can diagnose myelofibrosis. Your doctor might spot problems during a routine checkup before you notice any symptoms. If you visit the doctor with symptoms, they’ll start by asking about your medical history and doing a physical exam . They’ll check for signs of an enlarged spleen. They may also order exams including: Blood tests. A complete blood count (CBC) measures the number of each type of blood cell. A technician might also look at the cells under a microscope. And a comprehensive metabolic panel measures the levels of certain materials that your body makes, like electrolytes, fats, proteins, and enzymes. Imaging tests. Ultrasound and MRI make images of things inside your body. Gene tests. These find the changes that are linked to myelofibrosis. Bone marrow tests. Your doctor uses a needle to take a small sample of liquid marrow (called an aspiration) or bone (called a biopsy ) for analysis in a lab. Treatment for Myelofibrosis Your treatment will depend on your case, including your symptoms. If you don’t have any, your doctor might recommend waiting and watching for changes. Most treatments focus on the conditions that myelofibrosis causes. If you have anemia, your doctor might recommend: Glucocorticoid drugs such as prednisone Human-made male hormones (androgens) like danazol ( Danocrine ) Drugs that affect your immune system (immunomodulators) such as interferon alfa ( Intron A , Pegasys , Roferon-A ), lenalidomide ( Revlimid ), or thalidomide ( Thalomid ) An oral kinase inhibitor such as fedratinib ( Inrebic ), pacritinib ( Vonjo ), or ruxolitinib ( Jakafi ) Chemotherapy drugs like cladribine ( Leustatin , Mavenclad ) and hydroxyurea ( Hydrea ) Blood transfusions If your spleen is swollen, you may take: Hydroxyurea Interferon Ruxolitinib ( Jakafi ), the first drug approved by the FDA to treat intermediate or high-risk myelofibrosis In severe cases, you could need surgery to remove your spleen ( splenectomy ) or radiation therapy. A transplant of stem cells or bone marrow from another person (called allogeneic) is the only treatment that might cure myelofibrosis. It replaces your diseased bone marrow with healthy cells. But it can have dangerous side effects, so experts recommend it mostly for younger people who have no other health problems. Talk with your doctor about the treatment plan that’s best for you. See your doctor regularly to check your blood for any problems. About 20% of people with myelofibrosis could get acute myeloid leukemia , a kind of cancer that’s harder to treat. A cancer diagnosis isn’t easy. It can help to talk to other people who know what you’re going through. The Leukemia and Lymphoma Society and the American Cancer Society both offer online advice and local support groups."
24,Signs of a Nervous Breakdown,"What Is a Nervous Breakdown? A nervous breakdown (also called a mental breakdown) is a term that describes a period of extreme mental or emotional stress. The stress is so great that the person is unable to perform normal day-to-day activities. The term “nervous breakdown” isn’t a clinical one. Nor is it a mental health disorder. In the past, it was used to describe many different mental health conditions, but it’s no longer used by professionals today. Even so, this doesn’t mean that a nervous breakdown is a healthy response to stress. In fact, it’s quite the opposite, and it can sometimes indicate an underlying problem such as depression or anxiety. There is no one cause of a nervous breakdown. Anything that leads to excessive stress can trigger it. In general, feeling stress and being unable to cope with it may lead to feeling so overwhelmed that you can’t perform your normal daily functions. Some things that might trigger a nervous breakdown include: A sudden tragedy A major life change Constant stress at work (sometimes referred to as “burnout”) Anxiety Depression Poor sleep Abuse Financial problems Experiencing some stress is a normal part of life. When the feelings become too overwhelming, they can contribute to a mental breakdown. While these breakdowns can be scary and debilitating, there are things that you can do. Recognizing the signs, taking preventative action, and getting treatment can help. Signs of a Nervous Breakdown A nervous breakdown leads to the inability to function normally, at least temporarily. Several signs, however, can indicate that you, or someone you know, might be on the path toward experiencing overwhelming stress. Here are some of the signs and symptoms to watch out for: Feeling Symptoms of Anxiety or Depression Anxious or depressive feelings and actions are common responses to stress . These include: Low self-esteem Fearfulness Irritability Worrying Feeling helpless Getting angry easily Withdrawing from family and friends Losing interest in your favorite activities Difficulty breathing Uncontrollable crying Thoughts of self-harm or suicide When the stress becomes unbearable, it can lead to a nervous breakdown. Trouble Concentrating Studies have shown that stress affects both your mind and your body. Long-term stress can lead to structural changes in the brain, which can affect your memory and lead to difficulty concentrating. In extreme cases, too much cortisol can even lead to memory loss. Insomnia For some people, excessive stress may cause insomnia, making it difficult to fall asleep and stay asleep. When you can’t sleep, your brain and body can’t recover from stress, which, in turn, can lead to worsening stress and anxiety. A lack of sleep can also affect your physical health as well as your mental performance . Others may respond to stress by oversleeping, which may also lead to mental and physical problems. Extreme Fatigue Too much stress may leave you feeling extreme fatigue. You may feel tired because you’re not sleeping enough, or you may even feel tired because you’re sleeping too much. Over time, chronic exhaustion along with stress can lead to a mental breakdown. Changes in Appetite Stress can bring about changes in your appetite. Some people deal with stress by overeating, which can lead to unwanted weight gain. For others, stress can lead to appetite loss. Digestive Issues Stress and anxiety can lead to stomach issues like cramps, bloating, constipation, and diarrhea. If you have irritable bowel syndrome , stress may trigger flare-ups, which can cause digestive discomfort. If you’re stressed and starting to notice any of these symptoms, it could be a sign that you’re on your way to a nervous breakdown. Hallucinations In some instances, extreme stress can even cause hallucinations. You might hear or see things that aren’t really there. Treating a Nervous Breakdown It’s not uncommon to feel overwhelmed by life’s demands. If you’re beginning to feel as though your stress is becoming too much, talk to your doctor. They may refer you to a psychologist or psychiatrist . Your doctor may also be able to provide treatment for the physical symptoms. The right treatment for a nervous breakdown depends mainly upon its cause and the individual. Some common treatments include: Lifestyle Changes Mental fatigue is a common feature of a mental breakdown. For some, getting rest and de-stressing can be an effective home remedy. Changes might include such things as: Reducing your number of daily obligations Taking a walk or adding some form of exercise to your routine Eating a healthful diet Taking a break when you need it Practicing meditation Spending time in nature Medication Your doctor may prescribe antidepressants or anti-anxiety medication to help with the symptoms of a nervous breakdown. If your stress is causing insomnia, you may be prescribed a sleep aid. Disruptions in sleep can worsen stress and anxiety, which only worsen your insomnia. Sleep aids can help to break the sleeplessness cycle and reduce your stress. Psychotherapy Also known as “talk therapy,” psychotherapy helps you to work through your nervous breakdown and reduces your risk of experiencing another one. Speaking with a professional can help you to process your thoughts and create solutions that alleviate your stress and anxiety ."
25,Agoraphobia,"What Is Agoraphobia? Agoraphobia is a rare type of anxiety disorder. If you have it, your fears keep you from getting out into the world. You avoid certain places and situations because you think you’ll feel trapped and not be able to get help. For example, you might worry or panic when you are in: Public transportation (buses, trains, ships, or planes) Large, open spaces (parking lots, bridges) Closed-in spaces (stores, movie theaters) Crowds or standing in line Being outside your home alone You may be willing to go just a handful of places, or you may even dread leaving your house. Agoraphobia Causes and Risk Factors Doctors aren't sure what causes agoraphobia. They think it runs in families. You may haveit if you have a lot of panic attacks . That's when you have bursts of fear that come out of the blue and last for a few minutes. These happen when there's no real danger. Less than 1% of people in the U.S. have agoraphobia. Women are two to three times more likely to have it than men, and it's more common in teenagers and young adults. A few other things that can raise your chances of it include having: Panic disorder, especially if it’s not treated Other phobias A family member who has agoraphobia A history of very stressful or traumatic events Agoraphobia Symptoms If you have agoraphobia and end up in a place that scares you, you can become very anxious or panic. Physical symptoms of this can include: Fast, pounding heart Sweating , trembling, shaking Breathing problems Feeling hot or cold Nausea or diarrhea Chest pain Problems swallowing Dizziness or feeling faint You may feel like: You might not survive a panic attack. You’re not in control. You’ll look bad in front of others or that they’ll stare at you. You need to be with someone you trust when you go anywhere. You also might have: A fear of being alone in your house A general feeling of dread Agoraphobia Diagnosis A lot of the symptoms caused by agoraphobia are the same as those of other medical conditions like heart disease , stomach issues, and breathing problems . So you may make several trips to the doctor or emergency room before you and your doctor figure out what's really going on. Your doctor may ask: Do you find it scary or stressful to leave your house? Do you have to avoid some places or situations? What happens if you end up in one of them? They’ll do a physical exam and maybe some tests to rule out any other medical problems. If they don’t find a physical reason for your symptoms, they’ll probably recommend that you see a psychiatrist or therapist. At your session, you’ll answer questions about your feelings and your behavior. According to standards created by the American Psychiatric Association, you could be diagnosed with agoraphobia if you feel extreme fear or panic in at least two of these situations: Outside your house by yourself In an open space, like a parking lot or mall In an enclosed space, like a theatre or small office In a line or in a crowd On public transportation, including planes Agoraphobia Treatments Your doctor will usually treat agoraphobia with therapy , medication, or a combination of the two. Therapy . Cognitive therapy can teach you new ways to think about or face situations that cause panic and help you be less afraid. You may also learn relaxation and breathing exercises. Sometimes your therapist may suggest exposure therapy, in which you gradually start to do some of the things that make you anxious. Medicine . There are many drugs that your doctor might suggest for agoraphobia, but the most common are antidepressants . Doctors often start with a low dose of one of these medicines that raises the level of a ""feel-good"" chemical in your brain called serotonin. Some medications that help balance serotonin are citalopram ( Celexa ), escitalopram oxalate ( Lexapro ), fluoxetine ( Prozac ), sertraline ( Zoloft ), and venlafaxine ( Effexor ). You'll probably take medicine for at least 6 months to a year. If you feel better and no longer are stressed when you're in places that used to scare you, your doctor may begin tapering off your medicine. For short-term relief, your doctor may recommend anti-anxiety medications, called benzodiazepines, in addition to antidepressants. These are sedatives that can help with your symptoms. You can start to depend on them, so you shouldn’t take them for long. And be sure to tell your doctor if you’ve had any issues with alcohol or drug abuse. Alternative therapies. Applied relaxation is a series of exercises that help you notice when you start to feel tense and learn how to relax your muscles and ease that tension. It typically takes an hour-long session each week for 12 to 15 weeks. Other alternative therapies that may help include breathing exercises and meditation. Lifestyle changes. It can help to e xercise regularly and eat a healthy diet. Skip caffeine and alcohol . They can make your symptoms worse. Agoraphobia Outlook The right combination of medication and therapy can help manage agoraphobia and make living with it easier. A few other things to keep in mind: Get help when you need it. Family and friends can help you work through your fears, and a support group lets you connect with people who are going through the same things you are. Manage anxiety and stress. Talk with your therapist about ways to calm yourself and find relaxation techniques that work for you. Follow your doctor’s guidance. It’s really important to take medication as directed and keep your therapy appointments. Stay in touch with your health team so they can do their best for you."
26,Why Do I Get Motion Sickness?,"The ancient Greeks and Romans knew about motion sickness. Even NASA has made note of it. So if you have this common ailment, you’re part of a long tradition. There are ways to prevent or treat it to keep your travels or trip to the amusement park a pleasant one. What Causes It? You get motion sickness when there are conflicts among your senses. Say you’re on a ride at the fair, and it’s spinning you around and upside down. Your eyes see one thing, your muscles feel another, and your inner ears sense something else. Your brain can’t take in all those mixed signals. That’s why you end up feeling dizzy and sick. The Role of the Ears Your inner ears , in particular, help control your sense of balance. They are part of a network called the vestibular system. This system includes three pairs of semicircular canals and two sacs, called the saccule and the utricle. They send information about what’s going on around you to the brain . The semicircular canals hold a fluid that moves with the turns of your head. The saccule and utricle are sensitive to gravity. They tell the brain whether you’re standing up or lying down. The Role of the Brain Your brain takes in all this data, and it usually comes together and makes sense. But sometimes your brain gets confusing signals. On a flying plane, for example, you feel like you’re moving, but your eyes tell your brain that you don’t appear to be going anywhere. The opposite is true as well. After a long sea voyage, you can stand still on dry land but still feel like you’re moving. The result is the same: motion sickness. Who Gets It? Anybody can get motion sickness, but it’s most common in children and pregnant women. Unlike a cold , you can’t spread it to other people. It’s not contagious. Symptoms Motion sickness can strike quickly and make you break out in a cold sweat and feel like you need to throw up. Other common symptoms include: Dizziness Increase in saliva production Loss of appetite Pale skin In addition, some people get headaches , feel very tired , or have shallow breathing . Tips to Ease It For most people, symptoms usually don’t last long. They often go away once you get used to the situation, whether it’s the rocking of a boat or the movement of a train. But there are some simple things you can do if the motion sickness isn’t going away on its own: Relax. Find something to focus on, whether it’s taking deep breaths or counting backwards from 100. Closing your eyes can help, too. Look at a stable object. If you’re on a boat, look at the horizon. If you’re in a car, look through the windshield. Avoid alcohol . Eat lightly before travel but don’t fast. Breathe fresh air -- and don’t smoke. Avoid reading. If you can, get a seat over the wing if you’re flying, an upper-deck cabin if you’re sailing, or a front-seat spot if you’re in a car. Natural Remedies Some people feel like they get relief with these: Raw ginger . There’s some scientific proof that this root, long used as a folk remedy to fight nausea , is effective. But it may act as a blood thinner . Talk to your doctor first before you use it. Mint. Eating peppermint is thought to calm the body. At the very least, the aroma may soothe you. Acupuncture and acupressure . Some people say that stimulating a certain point just below the wrist helps ease their nausea . Medications If you’re still bothered by motion sickness, you can talk to your doctor about these: Dimenhydrinate ( Dramamine ). This over-the-counter antihistamine , used to ease allergies , helps with motion sickness, too. The first dose should be taken about an hour before traveling. More doses are taken every 4 to 6 hours. Scopolamine ( Maldemar ). This is a prescription medication . Your wear a patch behind the ear . You apply it 4 hours before needed. A dose lasts 3 days. Other drugs include: Cyclizine ( Marezine , Marzine, Emoquil) Meclizine ( Antivert , Bonine ) Promethazine ( Phenadoz , Phenergan , Promethegan ) All have side effects, including drowsiness and dry mouth . When Should I See a Doctor? Motion sickness usually goes away once the journey is over. But if you’re still dizzy, have a headache , continue to vomit, notice hearing loss or chest pain , call your doctor."
27,"Hyperpigmentation, Hypopigmentation, and Your Skin","Pigmentation is the coloring of a person's skin . When a person is healthy, their skin color will appear normal. In the case of illness or injury, the person's skin may change color, becoming darker (hyperpigmentation) or lighter (hypopigmentation). Hyperpigmentation and Skin Hyperpigmentation in skin is caused by an increase in melanin, the substance in the body that is responsible for color (pigment). Certain conditions, such as pregnancy or Addison's disease (decreased function of the adrenal gland), may cause a greater production of melanin and hyperpigmentation. Exposure to sunlight is a major cause of hyperpigmentation, and will darken already hyperpigmented areas. Hyperpigmentation can also be caused by various drugs, including some antibiotics , antiarrhythmics, and antimalarial drugs. Melasma An example of hyperpigmentation is melasma. This condition is characterized by tan or brown patches, most commonly on the face. Melasma can occur in pregnant women and is often called the ""mask of pregnancy;"" however, men can also develop this condition. Melasma sometimes goes away after pregnancy. It can also be treated with certain prescription creams (such as hydroquinone ). Melasma is often seen in women, but men can get it, too. Sunblock, either with clothing or strong sunscreen, can help. If you have melasma, try to limit your exposure to daylight. Wear a broad-brimmed hat and use a sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher at all times, because sunlight will worsen your condition. Sunscreens containing the physical blockers zinc oxide or titanium dioxide are also helpful in blocking daylight’s UVA rays, which makes hyperpigmentation worse. People with darker skin are at higher risk for melasma. It will look like dark brown or greyish brown patches on darker skin. Consult with your doctor before treating the condition yourself. Hypopigmentation and Skin Hypopigmentation in skin is the result of a reduction in melanin production. Examples of hypopigmentation include: Vitiligo : Vitiligo causes smooth, white patches on the skin. In some people, these patches can appear all over the body. It is an autoimmune disorder in which the pigment-producing cells are damaged. There is no cure for vitiligo, but there are several treatments, including cosmetic cover-ups, corticosteroid creams, calcineurin inhibitors ( Elidel cream , Protopic ointment ) or ultraviolet light treatments. The Janus Kinase inhibitor ruxolitinib ​​​​​​​ ( Opzelura ) has been approved for the treatment of nonsegmental vitiligo in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older. Albinism : Albinism is a rare inherited disorder caused by the absence of an enzyme that produces melanin. This results in a complete lack of pigmentation in skin, hair , and eyes . Albinos have an abnormal gene that restricts the body from producing melanin. There is no cure for albinism. People with albinism should use a sunscreen at all times because they are much more likely to get sun damage and skin cancer. This disorder can occur in any race, but is most common among whites. Pigmentation loss as a result of skin damage: If you've had a skin infection, blisters , burns, or other trauma to your skin, you may have a loss of pigmentation in the affected area. The good news with this type of pigment loss is that it's frequently not permanent, but it may take a long time to re-pigment. Cosmetics can be used to cover the area, while the body regenerates the pigment."
28,Fetal Alcohol Syndrome,"What Is Fetal Alcohol Syndrome? Fetal alcohol syndrome is the most severe fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. These are a group of birth defects that can happen when a pregnant woman drinks alcohol. Other fetal alcohol syndrome disorders (FASDs) include: Partial fetal alcohol syndrome Alcohol-related birth defects Alcohol-related neurodevelopment disorder Neurobehavioral disorder associated with prenatal alcohol exposure FAS and other spectrum disorders affect children differently. Symptoms can range from mild to severe. They can include: Problems with the heart , kidney , and bones Learning disabilities and low IQ Trouble with memory, coordination, and attention Hyperactivity Problems with sleep and suckling as an infant The symptoms of fetal alcohol syndrome tend to get worse as a person grows up. Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Causes Alcohol -- including wine, beer, and liquor -- is the leading preventable cause of birth defects in the U.S. In the womb, a baby doesn't have a fully developed liver that can process or break down alcohol, so it can easily get to and damage the baby's organs. That can cause: Miscarriage. You can lose your baby during the early few months of pregnancy. Stillbirth. You can lose your baby in the womb during the second half of your pregnancy. Preterm labor. Drinking can make your baby arrive too early. Premature babies can have many health problems. Those often include breathing trouble and other issues linked to  immature lungs or developmental problems due to underdeveloped brain or brain abnormalities. Birth defects. Some babies are born with heart or kidney problems. Others may have trouble seeing or hearing or other health issues. Some of the most severe problems happen when a pregnant woman drinks in the first trimester , when the baby's brain starts to develop. But the second and third trimesters aren’t safe either. The brain is still developing then, and this process can be interrupted by even moderate amounts of alcohol. There is no ""safe"" amount of alcohol that pregnant women can drink. And there is no time during pregnancy when it’s considered safe to drink alcohol, either. Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Symptoms Fetal alcohol syndrome can have many symptoms, including: Physical defects: Small head and brain size Vision or hearing problems Joint, limb, and finger deformities Distinctive facial features like small eyes, thin upper lip, and a ridge between the nose and upper lip Neurological problems: Learning problems Coordination and balance problems Trouble reasoning Hyperactivity Moodiness Behavioral issues: Poor social skills Difficulty in school Poor impulse control Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Diagnosis There is no lab test that can prove a child has fetal alcohol syndrome . Many of its symptoms can seem like ADHD . To diagnose fetal alcohol syndrome , doctors look for unusual facial features, lower-than-average height and weight , small head size, problems with attention and hyperactivity, and poor coordination. They also try to find out whether the mother drank while they were pregnant and if so, how much. The symptoms of fetal alcohol syndrome can't be cured, but early diagnosis and treatment can improve a child’s development and outlook. Research shows that children do better when they: Are diagnosed before age 6 Are in a loving, nurturing, and stable home during their school years Are not exposed to violence Get special education and social services Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Treatments Therapy can help with behavior and educational problems. Parents can also get training to help their child. There are no medications to treat fetal alcohol syndrome specifically. But certain medicines can help with symptoms like hyperactivity, inability to focus, or anxiety . These medications include: Antidepressants to treat problems with moods, sleep irritability, aggression, and problems in school. Anti-anxiety drugs. Stimulants to treat behavioral issues such as hyperactivity, trouble concentrating, and poor impulse control. Neuroleptics used to treat behavioral problems as well as aggression and anxiety. A child with fetal alcohol syndrome needs to be watched closely to see if their treatment needs to be adjusted. Complementary therapies may bring some benefits. They  include: Massage Acupuncture Exercise Yoga Treatment to help a mother with alcohol addiction is also recommended. Not only can this prevent fetal alcohol syndrome disorders in future children, it can also provide the mother with parenting skills to help their child with fetal alcohol syndrome. Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Complications Fetal alcohol syndrome can result in behavioral problems later in life. These include: Depression, anxiety, eating disorders, and other mental health issues Alcohol or drug abuse Inappropriate sexual behaviors Inability to stay in school or finish school Problems living independently or with employment Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) Behavioral problems such as aggression, rule or law breaking, and inappropriate social conduct Untimely death by suicide, accident, or homicide Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Prevention If you think you have a problem with alcohol, get help before you get pregnant. There are professionals who specialize in addiction treatment. Don’t drink alcohol while you’re trying to get pregnant. If you are still drinking when you find out you are pregnant or think you might be pregnant, stop immediately. Avoid alcohol while you’re pregnant. Children of mothers who don’t drink alcohol while they’re pregnant won’t develop fetal alcohol syndrome. If you’re sexually active and having unprotected sex, think about giving up alcohol entirely."
29,Alcohol Poisoning: How Much Alcohol Is Too Much?,"What Is Alcohol Poisoning? Alcohol poisoning happens when there’s too much alcohol in your blood, causing parts of your brain to shut down. It’s also called alcohol overdose. Alcohol poisoning is a serious illness caused by too much drinking in a short time. (Photo credit: iStock/Getty Images) Alcohol is a depressant. That means it can affect your brain and nervous system , slowing your breathing , your heart rate, and other important tasks that your body does. Your liver usually does a good job of keeping alcohol's toxins from getting into your bloodstream. But if you drink a lot in a short time, your liver may not be able to keep up. Alcohol poisoning can lead to brain damage or death. If you’re with someone who might have drunk too much, call 911 right away. Don't be afraid to get help. If you or your friend are under the legal drinking age, you might be worried about the legal consequences. But alcohol poisoning is so serious, that not calling 911 could result in death. In any case, it's unlikely that the paramedics or hospital team will call the police. Most states have Good Samaritan laws, which allow people to call 911 without fear of arrest if they're having a drug or alcohol overdose or see someone else who is overdosing. Learn how to tell if someone has alcohol poisoning . Signs of Alcohol Poisoning Symptoms start mild and grow worse. Signs of being drunk include: Confusion or slurred speech Poor coordination or stumbling Damp or clammy skin Alcohol poisoning could include those signs plus some more serious symptoms. These include: Severe confusion Trouble staying awake Throwing up Seizures Slow breathing (fewer than eight breaths per minute) Long pauses between breaths (10 seconds or more) Very slow heartbeat Low body temperature Bluish, gray, or pale skin Slow responses (such as a gag reflex) Alcohol Poisoning Complications In severe cases, alcohol poisoning can cause problems such as: Choking on your own vomit Trouble breathing because of vomit in your lungs Severe dehydration Hypothermia Brain damage Seizures Coma Heart attack Death Alcohol Poisoning Causes Alcoholic drinks contain a form of alcohol known as ethyl alcohol or ethanol. This is also found in mouthwashes, some medicines, and household products. Poisoning happens when you drink too much ethyl alcohol in a short space of time. Other kinds of alcohol that you might have around the house, such as isopropyl alcohol (rubbing alcohol) and methanol (wood alcohol), are toxic in a different way. Binge drinking Binge drinking is a major cause of alcohol poisoning. Binge drinking is defined as drinking that brings blood alcohol concentration (BAC) to 0.08% or higher. For a man, binge drinking is when you have five or more drinks in less than 2 hours. For a woman, it's four or more drinks in the same time frame. ""Extreme"" binge drinking involves double these amounts. Teens and college-age adults are most likely to engage in binge drinking. One drink is: 12 ounces of beer (5% alcohol) 5 ounces of wine (12% alcohol) 1.5 ounces (shot) of 80-proof liquor (gin, rum, whiskey, etc.), which is 40% alcohol 1.5 ounces (jigger) of brandy or cognac (40% alcohol) A mixed drink or cocktail could have more than one serving of alcohol in it. You can drink a fatal amount of alcohol before you pass out. Even if you're unconscious, your stomach and intestines continue to release alcohol into your bloodstream, increasing the level of alcohol in your body. Alcohol Poisoning Risks Although young people are most likely to engage in binge drinking, deaths from alcohol poisoning usually involve men between the ages of 35 and 64, according to the CDC. Men tend to drink more than women. And middle-aged people are more likely than younger ones to take prescription drugs , which can increase the severity of alcohol poisoning. Alcohol poisoning can depend on things such as: Your size or weight Your overall health Your alcohol tolerance How recently you ate food Whether you're taking drugs How much and how fast you drink How much alcohol is in your drink Emergency Action for Alcohol Poisoning If you think someone you're with has alcohol poisoning, take these steps: Call 911 right away. Don’t leave the person alone. Try to keep them awake and seated upright. Have them sip water if they’re awake. Cover them with a warm blanket. If they’re passed out, get them onto their side to keep them from choking on vomit. Tell the paramedics about their symptoms and how much they drank. Alcohol Poisoning Diagnosis Your doctor can diagnose alcohol poisoning based on your symptoms. They’ll also order blood and urine tests to check your alcohol levels. Your blood will be checked for its BAC. Alcohol Poisoning Treatment If you’ve drunk a dangerous amount of alcohol, doctors may ""pump"" your stomach . This keeps any leftover alcohol from getting into your bloodstream. At the hospital, they may also: Give you fluids through an IV Give you extra oxygen to help you breathe Flush your stomach of toxins Remove toxins from your blood Alcohol Poisoning Prevention If you’re going to drink alcohol, keep these tips in mind to avoid alcohol poisoning: Drink in moderation. It’s best for men to have no more than two drinks a day and for women to have only one. Alternate alcoholic drinks with nonalcoholic ones, ideally water. Don’t drink on an empty stomach. Food slows down the absorption of alcohol to some extent, though it can't prevent alcohol poisoning if you're drinking a lot. Don’t drink while you’re taking prescription medications or other drugs. Some drugs interact badly with alcohol. Don’t play drinking games or use funnels or beer bongs. Store alcohol safely. If you have small kids, keep products containing alcohol (such as mouthwashes and cold medicines) out of their reach. If you have teens, consider locking up your liquor cabinet. Alcohol Poisoning Myths The following things don't help reverse alcohol poisoning. In fact, they may make the effects worse: A cold shower can lower body temperature. Eating food can cause vomiting or choking. Black coffee or another drink with caffeine may make you feel alert, but it doesn't reduce the blood alcohol concentration or sober you up. Trying to ""walk it off"" could lead to a fall. Trying to throw up could cause choking. Takeaways Alcohol poisoning happens when there’s too much alcohol in your blood, and parts of your brain shut down. It's caused usually by binge drinking and can lead to death or brain damage. If you see signs of alcohol poisoning, such as throwing up, seizures, slow breathing, or severe confusion, don't hesitate to call 911. This is a serious matter. Alcohol Poisoning FAQs What is the best thing to do if you have alcohol poisoning? Call 911 right away. Don't assume you can sleep it off or that you'll be OK in the morning. And stay awake until you get help. If you can't sit up, lie on your side to prevent choking on your vomit. What's the difference between being drunk and alcohol poisoning? Someone who is “just drunk” will be slurring their words, stumbling around, and acting drowsy. Someone with alcohol poisoning will be breathing slowly or irregularly, have cold skin, be vomiting a lot, and perhaps have a seizure or lose consciousness. A drunk person can recover with rest, fluids, and eating a balanced meal, while a person with alcohol poisoning needs to go to the hospital and get an IV or maybe their stomach pumped. If you're not sure what stage a friend is at, call 911. In the U.S., paramedics don't charge for a visit unless the person needs to go to the hospital."
30,What Is Leukodystrophy?,"Leukodystrophy isn’t just one disease; it’s actually a group of diseases that affect the central nervous system. Doctors are discovering new forms of leukodystrophy all the time, but experts currently know of about 52 different kinds. Most of the leukodystrophies are genetic, meaning they’re passed down from parent to child. Sometimes symptoms will show up early in childhood. But because the diseases are progressive, meaning they get worse over time, some children born with a form of leukodystrophy may seem fine. Symptoms The one thing all leukodystrophies have in common is they cause abnormal development or destruction of the brain’s myelin sheath. That’s the white fatty matter that protects the brain’s nerves. Without it, your nervous system can’t function properly. But each leukodystrophy affects myelin differently. That means children can have many problems, including: Balance and mobility problems Behavioral and learning disabilities Bladder issues Breathing difficulties Developmental delays Hearing, speech, and vision problems Muscle control disorders Seizures For example, one type of leukodystrophy, Canavan disease, causes decreased muscle tone, especially in the neck, and abnormally straight legs and flexed arms. It can also include symptoms like blindness and seizures. Sometimes symptoms show up soon after a child is born, and sometimes as late as adulthood. Signs of Refsum Disease, for example, usually occur around age 20, but can be as late as age 50. Some of the common symptoms include degeneration of the retina in the eye, deafness, and loss of sense of smell. While every leukodystrophy is different, the most common problem is a child’s health gradually worsening in some way, even though they seemed fine to start with. This can be a worsening of their vision, hearing, speech, ability to eat, behavior, or thought. Since symptoms can vary so much, leukodystrophy can be hard to diagnose. Causes Most of the leukodystrophies are inherited, which means they’re passed down through family genes. Some may not be inherited, but are still caused by a genetic mutation. One child in your family could have leukodystrophy, and others might not. For example, Alexander disease doesn’t seem to be genetically inherited, so your child can have a defective gene even if neither you nor your partner have it. If you have a child with leukodystrophy and you’re planning to have more children, you may want to consider genetic counseling. It can help you understand your chances of having another child with leukodystrophy. Diagnosis Diagnosing leukodystrophy can be difficult. Oftentimes, doctors have to use several types of testing, including: Blood and urine analysis CT scans Genetic testing MRI scans Psychological and cognitive tests Treatment There is no cure for most kinds of leukodystrophy. Treating it depends on the type, and doctors address the symptoms of the disease with medications and special kinds of physical, occupational, and speech therapy. Some people may need additional help with learning or nutrition. In some cases, a bone marrow transplant can help by slowing or stopping the progression of the disease. Scientists are also researching whether gene therapy or replacing certain enzymes can help treat some kinds of leukodystrophy."
31,What Is Bartter Syndrome?,"Bartter syndrome is a group of similar rare conditions that affect the kidneys . It's genetic, which means it's caused by a problem with a gene. If you have it, too much salt and calcium leave your body when you pee. It also may cause low levels of potassium and high levels of acid in the blood . If all these are out of balance, you can have many different health problems. There are two major forms of Bartter syndrome. Antenatal Bartter syndrome starts before birth. It can be very serious, even life threatening. Babies may not grow as they should in the womb, or they may be born too early. The other form is called classic. It usually starts in early childhood and isn't as severe as the antenatal form. But it can affect growth and cause developmental delays. Gitelman syndrome is a subtype of Bartter syndrome. It tends to happen later -- usually from age 6 through adulthood. Symptoms Symptoms can be different for everyone, even for people with the same condition. Some common ones include: Constipation Frequent urination Generally feeling unwell Muscle weakness and cramping Salt cravings Severe thirst Slower than normal growth and development Antenatal Bartter syndrome may be diagnosed before birth. It can be found if there are signs the baby's kidneys aren't working right or there's too much fluid in the womb. Newborns with this form of the syndrome may pee very often and can have: Dangerously high fevers Dehydration Vomiting and diarrhea Unusual facial features such as triangle-shaped face, large forehead, large pointed ears Lack of normal growth Deafness at birth Causes Genes carry instructions that help your body work right. Genetic diseases can happen when there's a change in the gene (called a mutation). At least five genes are linked to Bartter syndrome, and they all play an important role in how your kidneys work -- especially in your ability to take in salt. Losing too much salt through pee (salt wasting) can affect how your kidneys take in other substances, including potassium and calcium. A lack of balance in these elements can lead to serious problems: Too little salt can cause dehydration , constipation , and frequent peeing. Too little calcium can weaken bones and cause frequent kidney stones. Low blood levels of potassium can cause muscle weakness, cramping, and fatigue . Diagnosis and Treatment For children with symptoms of classic Bartter syndrome, a doctor will do a thorough exam along with blood and urine tests. The antenatal form can be diagnosed before birth by testing the amniotic fluid in the womb. Genetic testing may also be done. Your child's doctor will take blood and possibly small samples of tissue so a specialist can look for mutations. Once your child is diagnosed, their care may involve a team of specialists, including pediatricians, kidney experts, and social workers. To make sure they keep a healthy balance of fluids and other important things, one or several of these may be recommended: Indomethacin, an anti-inflammatory drug that helps their body make less urine Potassium-sparing diuretics, which help them keep potassium RAAS inhibitors, which help keep them from losing potassium Calcium , potassium or magnesium supplements or a combination of them Food high in salt, water , and potassium Fluids put directly into a vein (for infants with severe forms) Because there's no cure, people who have Bartter syndrome will need to take certain medications or supplements for life."
32,What Is Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy Syndrome?,"Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome (RSD) is a disorder that causes lasting pain , usually in an arm or leg, and it shows up after an injury, stroke , or even heart attack . But the severity of pain is typically worse than the original injury itself. Doctors don’t know exactly what causes it, but they are able to treat many cases. The term reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome is actually not a name that doctors use anymore. It’s an older term used to describe one form of Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS). RSD is sometimes called Type I CRPS, and it’s caused by injury to tissue with no related nerve damage . What Causes RSD? Doctors think the pain caused by RSD comes from problems in your sympathetic nervous system. Your sympathetic nervous system controls blood flow movements that help regulate your heart rate and blood pressure . When you get hurt, your sympathetic nervous system tells your blood vessels to get smaller so you don’t lose too much blood at your injury site. Later, it tells them to open back up so blood can get to damaged tissue and repair it. When you have RSD, your sympathetic nervous system gets mixed signals. It turns on after an injury, but doesn’t turn back off. This causes a lot of pain and swelling at your injury site. Sometimes, you can get RSD even if you haven’t had an injury, although it’s not as common. RSD is a little more typical in women than in men. Children can get it, too, but usually it shows up between ages 30 and 60. Symptoms When you get RSD, your symptoms may show up slowly. You may have pain first, and then it may get worse over time. You may not realize your pain is abnormal at first. The types of injuries that can cause RSD include: Amputation Bruises Burns Cuts Fractures Minor surgery Needle sticks Radiation therapy Sprains It’s most common to get RSD in your arm, shoulder , leg, or hip. Usually the pain spreads beyond your injury site. In some cases, symptoms can spread to other parts of your body, too. RSD can also affect your immune system . This can cause: Redness Skin that’s warm to the touch around the injury Swelling The pain you get with RSD is usually constant and severe. Many people describe RSD pain as: Aching Burning Cold Deep Throbbing Your skin may also feel sensitive when you do things that don’t normally hurt it, like taking a shower. Or it might hurt just to wear your clothes. Other symptoms of RSD include: Changes in your hair or nail growth, or skin’s texture Excess sweat in certain areas of your body Muscle weakness or spasms Stiff joints Trouble moving the injured area White, mottled, red, or blue skin Diagnosis Often, doctors don’t know your pain is being caused by RSD until you’ve had it for some time. When pain doesn’t go away, or is more severe than it should be for your type of injury, it can be the first clue that it could be RSD. There’s no single test that can tell your doctor whether you have RSD. Instead, they’ll rely on a physical exam and your medical history information. There are also a few tests that can provide clues to see if you have certain signs of the condition. These include: Bone scan. This test can detect if any of your bones are wearing away at the ends or whether there are issues with regular blood flow. MRI . Your doctor might order an MRI to look inside your body, specifically at your tissues, for noticeable changes. Sweat test. This test can tell your doctor if you sweat more on one side of your body than the other. Thermography test. This sympathetic nervous system test checks to see if the temperature or blood flow is different at your injury site than in other parts of your body. X-rays. These are typically ordered if your syndrome is in later stages to look for mineral loss in your bones. Treatment Early detection is key in RSD treatment. The earlier you’re able to catch it, the better your treatment will work. Some cases of RSD don’t respond to treatment. RSD doesn’t have a cure, but it’s possible to recover from many of the symptoms. Some of the medications your doctor may suggest include: Anesthetic creams like lidocaine Antidepressants Anti-inflammatory drugs, called NSAIDs Anti- seizure medications that may help treat pain Nasal spray that treats bone loss Nerve blocking injections Over-the-counter options like aspirin , ibuprofen , or naproxen for pain Other treatments that are less frequently used because of their risk of side effects and the lack of evidence that they work as well include: Corticosteroids like methylprednisolone ( Medrol ) or prednisolone (AsmalPred Plus ) to treat swelling Opioids , such as fentanyl ( Duragesic ), hydrocodone ( Hysingla ER , Zohydro ER ), morphine ( Arymo ER , Kadian , Morphabond , MS Contin ), and oxycodone Other ways to treat symptoms include: Electrodes on your spinal cord that send small electric shocks to relieve pain Physical therapy to help you move around more easily and take away pain Psychotherapy that can teach you relaxation methods Splints to help with hand pain If your pain doesn’t seem to be going away, even after treatment, your doctor may suggest a surgery called a sympathectomy. During this procedure, a surgeon removes certain nerves around your blood vessels to help improve your blood flow."
33,Are You Allergic to Insect Stings?,"If you get stung by a bee, wasp, yellow jacket, hornet, or fire ant, would you know if you had an allergic reaction ? Those are the insect stings that most often trigger allergies. Most people aren’t allergic. By knowing the difference, you can decide if you need to see a doctor. 3 Types of Reactions The severity of symptoms from a sting varies from person to person. But in general: A normal reaction sets off pain, swelling, and redness around the sting site. A large local reaction causes swelling that extends beyond the sting site. For example, a person stung on the ankle may have swelling of the entire leg. While it often looks alarming, it's usually no more serious than a normal reaction. Large local reactions peak at about 48 hours and then gradually get better over 5 to 10 days. The most serious reaction is an allergic one (described below). You'll need to get it treated right away. What Are the Symptoms of an Insect Sting Allergy? A mild allergic reaction may cause one or more of these symptoms at the site of the sting: Pain Redness Pimple-like spots Mild to moderate swelling Warmth Itching Severe allergic reactions (also called an anaphylactic reaction) are not that common. But when they happen, they're emergencies. Symptoms can include: Trouble breathing Hives that appear as a red, itchy rash and spread to areas beyond the sting Swelling of the face, throat, or any part of the mouth or tongue Wheezing or trouble swallowing Restlessness and anxiety Rapid pulse Dizziness or a sharp drop in blood pressure Stomach cramps, n ausea , or diarrhea Get emergency treatment as soon as possible. How Common Are Insect Sting Allergies? About 2 million Americans have allergies to the venom of stinging bugs. If you’re allergic to bee stings, you may also be allergic to yellow jackets, wasps, and hornets. Many of these people are at risk for life-threatening allergic reactions. Treatment if You’re Not Allergic First, if you’re stung on the hand, remove any rings from your fingers immediately. If stung by a bee, the bee usually leaves a sac of venom and a stinger in your skin. Remove the stinger within 30 seconds to avoid receiving more venom. Gently scrape the sac and stinger out with a fingernail or a stiff-edged object like a credit card. Don’t squeeze the sac or pull on the stinger, or more venom will get into you. Wash the stung area with soap and water, then apply an antiseptic. Apply a soothing ointment, like a hydrocortisone cream or calamine lotion, and cover the area with a dry, sterile bandage. If swelling is a problem, apply an ice pack or cold compress to the area. Take an over-the-counter oral antihistamine to ease itching, swelling, and hives. Don’t give this medication to children under 2 years old or to pregnant women unless your doctor says it’s OK. (If you’re pregnant, it’s best to talk to your doctor before you take any medicine.) You can also take an “NSAID” pain reliever such as ibuprofen. Read the label on any medicines first. Parents of children and people with medical conditions should talk with a pharmacist if they have questions about a medicine's use. Treatment if You’re Allergic If you have a severe allergic sting reaction, you’ll need epinephrine, which you can inject yourself before you call 911. Usually, this shot will stop a more severe allergic reaction from happening. You’ll still need emergency medical care, even if the symptoms seem to stop. You may need to stay overnight at the hospital. If you’ve ever had allergic reactions to an insect sting, carry epinephrine with you wherever you go. How Can I Avoid Being Stung? You can’t completely. But these steps make it less likely. 1. Learn to recognize insect nests and avoid them. Yellow jackets nest in the ground in dirt mounds or old logs and walls. Honeybees camp out in beehives. Hornets and wasps make their homes in bushes, trees, and on buildings. 2. Wear shoes and socks when outdoors. 3. Wear long-sleeved shirts, long pants, socks, and shoes when in rural or wooded areas. 4. Avoid wearing perfumes or brightly colored clothing. They tend to attract insects. 5. If you have severe allergies, make sure you have someone with you if you hike, boat, swim, golf, or do other things outdoors, just in case. 6. Consider using screens on windows and doors at home. You may also want to use insect repellents when you’re outside. 7. Spray garbage cans regularly with insecticide, and keep the cans covered. 8. Avoid or remove insect-attracting plants and vines growing in and around the home. Also, if you're severely allergic, always wear identification that says you have an allergy. Keep an epinephrine kit on hand in case of an emergency, too. For more information on where to get a MedicAlert bracelet, you can call 800-ID-ALERT. What Are Epinephrine Kits? These let you give yourself medicine (epinephrine) right away if you’re stung, before you get to a doctor for treatment. The most common brand is an EpiPen . You should still see a doctor ASAP after being stung. You'll need a prescription from your doctor to buy one of these kits. Carry two with you at all times. In order to prevent drug interactions , tell your doctor about any medicine you take. How Can I Prevent an Allergic Reaction? Allergy shots may help. They're about 97% effective. Allergy shots for insect stings put tiny amounts of the allergen (you may hear it called insect venom) into your body over time. Your body gets used to the allergen, and if you get stung again, you won’t have such a bad reaction. Your doctor will first test you to find out what insects you’re allergic to. Then you’ll typically get the shots once or twice a week. The dose will go up slightly over time until you reach a maintenance dose, usually in about 3 to 6 months. For most people, allergy shots are safe. You may have side effects like redness and warmth at the injection site. You could also have a mild or serious allergic reaction to the shot itself. They may be more risky for people who have heart or lung disease or who take certain medications ."
34,Should You Get Allergy Shots?,"What Are Allergy Shots? You probably take something to ease your seasonal allergy symptoms. Maybe you’re using more and more medicine over time, or it’s not working that well. You may be thinking about switching to immunotherapy to see if that helps more. Immunotherapy for allergies, such as allergy shots, aren't a quick fix but in time, they can make a big difference. Immunotherapy for allergies exposes you to a tiny amount of your allergy trigger so that over time, your body learns to handle it better. This can make a big difference in your allergy symptoms. “A lot of patients now are looking for more natural treatment options and minimizing the amount of medications they’re needing,” says Kara Wada, MD, an assistant professor of allergy and immunology at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. If you’ve got asthma, it must be under good control before you start this type of treatment because exposure to your allergy trigger has the potential to cause a flare-up. Allergy shots are one form of immunotherapy for allergies. You get the shots in a doctor’s office. They can make a big difference and may even get rid of your symptoms. But it may take years for them to take full effect. Sublingual immunotherapy is another form. It uses tablets. (“Sublingual” means that the medicine goes under your tongue.) Sublingual treatments haven’t been studied as much as allergy shots. They haven’t been shown to work as well as allergy shots. But if you’re up for the commitment of taking the medicine day in, day out, as prescribed, it might be an option to explore for the specific allergies it targets. If you’re interested in allergy shots or sublingual immunotherapy, you first need to visit your allergist and get tested to pinpoint exactly what you’re allergic to, if you haven’t done this already. How Often Do You Get Allergy Shots? With allergy shots, your allergist creates a shot formulation that’s based on your test results. You’ll need to get a shot from your allergist once or twice a week for 3-6 months. You’ll get the shot in your upper arm. It'll contain a tiny amount of the thing you’re allergic to -- pollen, pet dander, mold, dust mites, or bee venom, for example. Each week, your doctor will raise the amount of allergens in the shot until you reach a maintenance dose. Your doctor might recommend that you take an antihistamine before you get each treatment. Once you reach the maintenance dose, you can usually cut back on your visits (and shots) to every 2-4 weeks, a schedule you keep for 3-5 years or until your symptoms improve. “There seems to be some point within that window when the immune response changes,” Wada says. You’ll need to wait in your allergist’s office for about half an hour after each allergy shot to make sure you don’t have a serious reaction. With sublingual immunotherapy, your treatment will probably start 12-16 weeks before pollen season begins and last through pollen season. You take the first dose in the allergist’s office and the rest at home. How Soon Do Allergy Shots Help My Symptoms? The most obvious drawback for allergy shots is the time commitment. You must stick to a weekly schedule of allergist visits for months, and it could be years of monthly follow-ups before you see significant improvement. That said, symptoms generally start to improve within the first year of treatment and often continue to get better during the second year. By the third to fifth year, most people are free of allergy symptoms and may be able to stop getting shots. If your symptoms don’t improve after a year of shots, talk with your doctor about other treatment options. Allergy Shots Side Effects Aside from time, there’s the potential for a reaction to the treatment, since it has small amounts of the things you’re allergic to. For instance, you may have redness or swelling around the injection site if you get a shot, or you may have other symptoms. “Sometimes, patients report an increase in nose or eye symptoms, such as stuffy nose, runny nose, or itchy eyes,” says allergy immunologist Kathleen Dass, MD, of the Michigan Allergy, Asthma & Immunology Center. It’s rare, but it’s also possible to have anaphylaxis, which is a severe allergic reaction involving hives, swelling, trouble breathing, dizziness, and loss of consciousness. That’s why you need to get the treatment in your allergist’s office and wait there for a while after each shot, Dass says. Sublingual immunotherapy treatments often cause mouth and throat irritation, Wada says. But they’re less likely to lead to anaphylaxis, research shows. Does Insurance Cover Allergy Shots? Allergy shots can be expensive, but they’re generally covered by insurance. Check your plan. If you have a high-deductible health plan, you may have to pay out of pocket until you hit your deductible each year. If you’re thinking about sublingual treatment, you can get it only for allergies to ragweed, certain grasses, and dust mites. So if you’re having reactions to a different type of allergen, it’s not an option. How Well Do Allergy Shots Work? If you stick with allergy shots long enough, there’s a good chance you’ll see improvement or even an end to your allergy symptoms. About 85% of people with hay fever who get this type of treatment say their allergy symptoms get better. “That’s one of the things I find pretty neat as an allergist,” Wada says. “Typically, a lot of the treatments we have are geared toward treating the symptoms. This is one of the few things we have toward the root of the problem.” How Should I Prepare for Allergy Shots? You may want to avoid exercise or doing anything strenuous for 2 hours before and after your appointment. Exercise boosts blood flow to the tissues and may cause the allergens to spread throughout your body faster. It’s not likely to cause a serious problem, but it’s best to be safe. Tell your doctor about any other medicines or herbs and supplements you take. Some medications interfere with the treatment or raise the risk of side effects. You may need to stop allergy shots if you take these medications. If you’re pregnant or planning to get pregnant, ask your doctor whether you should continue to get allergy shots. What Should I Expect After Getting Allergy Shots? Usually, you’ll stay at the doctor’s office for about 30 minutes after you get an allergy shot. That's to make sure you don't get side effects like itchy eyes, shortness of breath, a runny nose, or a tight throat. If you get these symptoms after you leave, go back to your doctor's office or to the nearest emergency room. Redness, swelling, or irritation right around the site of the injection is normal. These symptoms should go away in 4 to 8 hours. When Should I Call My Doctor? Get on the phone and go to the nearest emergency room if you have shortness of breath, a tight throat, or any other symptoms that worry you after getting your shot. Who Should Not Get Allergy Shots? They may be more risky for people with heart or lung disease, or who take certain medications. Tell your allergist about your health and any medicines you take, so you can decide if allergy shots are a good option for you."
35,Latex Allergies,"What Is a Latex Allergy? A latex allergy is when your body’s immune system overreacts to certain kinds of proteins found in natural rubber latex that’s used to make things like rubber gloves, condoms , and some medical devices. Doctors don’t know what causes it. Coming in contact with latex and rubber products over and over may be part of the reason it happens. Who Is Likely to Develop a Latex Allergy? About 5% to 10% of health care workers have some form of latex allergy . Other people who are more likely than most people to get it include those who have: A defect in their bone marrow cells A deformed bladder or urinary tract Had more than one operation A urinary catheter, which has a rubber tip Allergy , asthma , or eczema Spina bifida Food allergies to apples , bananas, carrots , celery, chestnuts, kiwi, melons, papayas, raw potatoes, avocadoes, pineapple , and tomatoes Rubber industry workers and people who use condom s are also more likely than others to get a latex allergy. How Can You Be Exposed to Latex? You can get exposed to latex: Through the skin , such as when you wear latex gloves Through mucous membranes, such as the eyes , mouth, vagina , and rectum Through inhalation. Rubber gloves can contain cornstarch powder, which absorbs the latex and can become airborne when the gloves are removed. Through the blood . This can happen when some medical devices containing rubber are used. Types of Latex Allergies There are three types of latex reactions: 1. Irritant contact dermatitis . This is the least-threatening type, and it’s not an allergic skin reaction. It usually happens due to repeated exposure to chemicals in latex gloves and leads to dryness, itching , burning, scaling, and skin problems . This generally starts 12-24 hours after contact. 2. Allergic contact dermatitis. This is a delayed reaction to additives used in latex processing. It results in the same type of reactions as irritant contact dermatitis . But the reaction is more severe, spreads to more parts of the body, and lasts longer. Symptoms can start anywhere from 1 to 4 days after you've come in contact with latex. 3. Immediate allergic reaction (latex hypersensitivity). This one is the most serious. It can show up as a nasal allergy with hay fever-like symptoms, conjunctivitis ( pinkeye ), cramps , hives , and severe itching. It’s rare, but symptoms may also include rapid heartbeat, tremors, chest pain , trouble breathing , low blood pressure , or anaphylaxis , a severe allergic reaction that can be life-threatening. If you have severe symptoms, call your doctor or 911 immediately, or go to the nearest emergency room. Latex Allergy Diagnosis Doctors diagnose a latex allergy in people who: Have had symptoms of an allergic reaction -- like a skin rash , hives , eye tearing or irritation, wheezing , itching , or trouble breathing -- when exposed to latex or a natural rubber product Are known to be at risk for a latex allergy and blood or skin tests show that they have it, even if they haven’t had symptoms. If you need a skin test to check on a latex allergy, an allergy specialist must supervise it, in case you have a severe reaction. Latex Allergy Treatment There’s no cure for a latex allergy. If you’re allergic to latex, the best course of action is to avoid contact with it. If you do have a reaction, the treatment will depend on how serious it is. For irritated skin, these may be enough: Antihistamines Corticosteroid medicines Soothing lotion like calamine or a 1% hydrocortisone cream If your reaction is severe, you may need these right away: Epinephrine IV fluids Watchful care from medical professionals If you have a latex allergy , wear a medical alert bracelet or another type of ID in case of an emergency. You may also need to carry two epinephrine shots if your doctor recommends that. Latex Allergy Home Triggers An allergy to latex can become worse the more you come in contact with it. If you know you have this condition, be aware of products that may have the potential to cause a reaction. Ask your doctor if you need to avoid them. Many items have latex in them. Read product labels carefully. You may need to ask product makers to be sure. Home goods that are made with latex include: Rubber sink stoppers and sink mats Gloves for dishwashing and household cleaning Rubber or rubber-grip utensils Rubber electrical cords or water hoses Bath mats and floor rugs that have rubber backing Toothbrushes with rubber grips or handles Rubber tub toys Sanitary napkins (that contain rubber) Condoms and diaphragms Diapers that contain rubber Adult undergarments that contain rubber Waterproof bed pads containing rubber Undergarments, socks, and other clothing with elastic bands that contain rubber Adhesives such as glue, paste, art supplies, glue pens Older Barbie dolls and other dolls that are made of rubber Rubber bands, mouse and keyboard cords, desktop and chair pads, rubber stamps Mouse and wrist pads containing rubber Keyboards and calculators with rubber keys or switches Pens with comfort grip or any rubber coating Remote controllers for TVs or recording devices with rubber grips or keys Camera, telescope, or binocular eyepieces Bathing caps and elastic in bathing suits Some rain boots and raincoats Outside the home, latex is also in many items, such as: Grocery store checkout belts Restaurants where workers use latex gloves to prepare food Some balloons Car races that give off tire and rubber particles ATM machine buttons made of rubber Gloves worn by beauty salon workers Medical products containing latex include: Tourniquets Blood pressure pads EKG pads Stethoscopes IV tubing Some adhesive bandages Dental devices How Can I Safely Visit a Doctor or Dentist? Tell them about your latex allergy at least 24 hours before your appointment. The hospital or doctor's office should have a plan in place so they can use products like nonlatex gloves to treat you. Ask for the first appointment in the morning. Even if your doctor or dentist uses latex-free gloves for you, there can be latex particles in the air from gloves used with other patients. You're more likely to avoid these particles by getting there early. If you have to stay in the hospital, you'll usually be given your own room, free of products that might give you a reaction. Food Triggers Between 30% and 50% of people who have a latex allergy also have reactions to eating, touching, or even smelling certain foods. This happens because some fruits and vegetables have proteins that are structured a lot like the ones that cause the reaction to latex. It’s called a cross-reaction. These foods include: Avocado Banana Celery Cherry Chestnut Fig Grape Hazelnut Kiwi Melon Nectarine Papaya Peach Pineapple Plum Potato Rye Strawberries Tomato Wheat Almonds, peppermint, and mustard can also cause cross-reactions. If you’re allergic to any of these foods, you may also have a latex allergy, even if you don’t know it. Let your doctor and dentist know so they can keep from exposing you."
36,Understanding Encephalitis: The Basics,"What Is Encephalitis? Encephalitis (pronounced en-sef-uh- lie -tis) is inflammation of your brain tissue. It can be very serious and may cause personality changes, seizures , weakness, and other symptoms, depending on the part of your brain affected. Encephalitis is an inflammation in your brain. Most cases are caused by infection with a virus, such as the herpes simplex virus. (Photo Credit: Science Photo Library/Getty Images) Encephalitis is rare, affecting about 10-15 in 100,000 people each year in the U.S. Young children, older adults, and those with a weak immune system are most vulnerable. It's usually caused by an infection with viruses, bacteria, fungi, or parasites, although it can be caused by an autoimmune condition or some medicines as well. Most people who have mild encephalitis fully recover. Your treatment and chance of recovery depend on the cause and severity of your inflammation. In acute encephalitis, the infection directly affects your brain cells. In parainfectious encephalitis, your brain and spinal cord become inflamed within 1-2 weeks of contracting an infection (usually viral or bacterial) . Encephalitis vs. meningitis Encephalitis and meningitis are both diseases that cause inflammation in your brain. However, while encephalitis is an inflammation of your brain tissue, meningitis is an inflammation of the membranes that cover your brain and spinal cord (called meninges). Like encephalitis, meningitis is often caused by a viral or bacterial infection, but it can also be caused by fungal or parasitic infections, injuries, certain drugs, and some types of cancer. Is encephalitis contagious? Swelling in your brain isn’t contagious, but the causes can be. For example, viral encephalitis can be caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV) that can pass from person to person. Childhood diseases, such as measles, mumps, and German measles (Rubella), used to be a common cause of viral encephalitis in kids, but these causes are a bit rarer now since most people get vaccinated against them before they start school. Encephalitis Causes Viral infections with any of the following three groups of viruses are the most common cause of encephalitis. These include: Herpes viruses, which include HSV (especially HSV-1), chickenpox, cytomegalovirus, and Epstein-Barr virus Viruses that are transmitted through bugbites, such as West Nile virus , Dengue virus, and Eastern equine encephalitis virus Viruses that cause childhood infections, such as measles, mumps, and Rubella Less commonly, encephalitis may be caused by: Infection with HIV or the virus that causes rabies Bacterial and other infections, such as syphilis or toxoplasmosis (an infection with a parasite from infected cat poop) Autoimmune conditions Some kinds of cancer Some medicines Sometimes, your doctor may not be able to tell what caused your encephalitis. Encephalitis Types Infectious encephalitis It is usually caused by a viral infection but can also be caused by bacteria, fungi, and parasites. As it's usually caused by viral infections, it's more common in people who are exposed to bugs that can transmit diseases, such as people who spend a lot of time outdoors, especially near standing water. Infectious encephalitis can develop quickly and the symptoms can be serious. Autoimmune encephalitis It is usually caused by proteins that your body makes in your brain. These proteins cause inflammation in your brain. Doctors don't yet know for sure why some people develop these proteins, while other people don't. Autoimmune encephalitis tends to develop more slowly than infectious encephalitis and may cause more neurological symptoms, such as confusion, memory issues, and seizures. It's also rarer than infectious encephalitis. Some conditions that are linked to autoimmune encephalitis include: Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis Hashimoto’s encephalopathy LGI1/CASPR2-antibody encephalitis Limbic encephalitis Rasmussen’s encephalitis Both infectious and autoimmune encephalitis can cause serious, life-threatening symptoms. If you or someone else has neurological symptoms, such as irritability, seizures, or extreme drowsiness, call 911 or go to the emergency room right away. Encephalitis Symptoms Your symptoms depend on the type of encephalitis you have. People with infectious encephalitis may have symptoms of an infection before they get encephalitis. Signs of encephalitis can include: Fatigue or loss of energy Fever, especially a high fever Headache that can be severe Sensitivity to light and sound Mild-to-moderate neck stiffness Drowsiness or loss of consciousness Irritability, anxiety, and behavioral or personality changes Hallucinations Signs of severe encephalitis may include: Weakness or trouble moving some parts of your body Double vision Confusion, trouble speaking, or difficulty understanding when someone talks to you Coma Seizures A bulging soft spot (fontanel) in infants Go to the ER or call 911 right away if you or someone else has any signs of severe encephalitis. Encephalitis Diagnosis Your doctor will ask about your symptoms, including how long you've had them. Because people with encephalitis can be disoriented, family and friends are key to getting a good history. It's important to know if you've come into contact with mosquitoes or ticks , infected animals, or sick people. Your doctor will also do a physical exam and may order some tests. Encephalitis tests Some of the tests your doctor may use include: Blood tests, including a complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel Urine, stool, or sputum culture tests to see if you have an infection and what type you have Imaging tests, such as CT scans, MRI scans, and magnetoencephalography (MEG) to see where in your brain you are having seizures Electroencephalogram (EEG) to look for seizers or specific electrical activity in your brain Spinal tap (lumbar puncture) to remove cerebrospinal fluid to find infections in your brain or spinal cord A neurological exam, which is a series of tests that show how well your nervous system is working An intracranial pressure monitoring (ICP) to measure the pressure inside your skull Rarely, a biopsy of your brain tissue to look at under a microscope Encephalitis Risk Factors Several risk factors could increase your chance of getting encephalitis. These include: Age. Young children and older adults are at a higher risk for viral encephalitis. Some types of autoimmune encephalitis are more common in children and young adults. Having a weakened immune system. This could be because you have HIV, take medicines for cancer, or have a condition such as diabetes. Having an autoimmune condition. Smoking. Living in areas where mosquito- or tick-borne viruses spread easily, particularly in the summer months. Encephalitis Treatment Because the complications from encephalitis can be serious, you may need to go to the hospital. You will usually need monitoring for your blood pressure, heart rate, and breathing. You will also usually need IV fluid therapy to help keep your brain from swelling more. Otherwise, your treatment will depend on your age, condition, and the cause of your disease. Some common treatments include: Steroids that can help reduce swelling in your brain Antiviral drugs, such as acyclovir (Zovirax), Foscarnet (Foscavir), or Ganciclovir (Cytovene) for people who have viral encephalitis Antibiotics for people with bacterial encephalitis Anticonvulsant therapy for people with seizures Immune globulin and plasmapheresis for people with autoimmune encephalitis Over-the-counter medicines, such as acetaminophen, that can help control fever and headaches Supportive care Supportive care is a type of care for patients who are seriously ill. The goal is to focus your treatment on what is most important to you. This may involve, for instance, focusing on relieving your symptoms and how other treatments will affect how you feel. You usually get supportive care alongside specific treatments for your condition. Examples of supportive care may include: Use of a ventilator or other breathing help, such as an oxygen mask IV fluids to keep you hydrated Medications for pain, inflammation, infection, seizures, and other issues Post encephalitis therapy Once you have been treated for encephalopathy and the inflammation is gone, you may still need some treatment and support to continue your recovery. Some people need help such as: Physical therapy to help regain your muscle strength to stand, walk, or perform regular tasks. Occupational therapy (OT), which often works hand in hand with physical therapy. OT helps you work on your everyday skills and may give you ideas for adaptations, such as special tools, if you need help with some of your day-to-day activities. Speech therapy, which helps you regain or fine-tune your ability to speak or communicate clearly. Brain rehabilitation or retraining, which helps you improve your memory and your cognition. Psychotherapy, which helps you learn how to cope with changes in your life and manage your moods and behavior. Encephalitis Complications After you recover from the swelling in your brain, from encephalitis, you may have long-term damage in your brain that needs ongoing medical care. For instance, some people may have long-term problems, such as: Memory loss (amnesia) Personality and behavioral changes Emotional and psychological problems, such as anxiety, depression, and mood swings Problems with attention, concentration, planning, and problem-solving Repeated seizures (epilepsy) Hearing loss Speech and language problems Problems swallowing Problems with balance, coordination, and movement Long-term fatigue In severe cases, loss of consciousness (coma) and death Encephalitis Prevention The best way to avoid getting encephalitis is to avoid the germs that can cause it. Here are some tips: Get yourself and your kids vaccinated, as recommended by your doctors. The elimination of smallpox and the availability of vaccines that prevent mumps , measles , and rubella have lowered cases of encephalitis , especially in children. If you're traveling in an area that has a high risk of tick-borne or mosquito-borne viruses, make sure you get vaccinated before you head out. The CDC's website has a travelers' health page where you can look up your destination and get a list of all the recommended vaccines for that location. Wash your hands completely and often with soap and water throughout your day, especially before you handle food, eat or drink, and after using the bathroom. Don't share food, eating utensils, or glasses. Don't share personal-care items and remind your kids not to share their things, such as razors, towels, makeup, or toothbrushes. Take these steps to avoid getting bitten by mosquitoes and ticks: Avoid being outside between dusk and dawn when mosquitoes are most likely to bite you. If do have to be out then, wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants. Make sure mosquitoes can't get into your house through broken screens and windows. Also, run a fan, which can keep mosquitos moving around so they're less likely to land on and bite you. Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants when you're in wooded areas with tall grasses and shrubs, where ticks like to hang out. Check yourself, your kids, and your pets for ticks when they come inside during tick season (this can be year-round for people in the U.S. South and on the West Coast, but for most of the U.S., it's early spring to winter). Use bug repellent and insecticide. You can use the mosquito repellent DEET on both your skin and clothes. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recommends spraying your clothes, tents, and outdoor gear with products that contain permethrin to repel and kill both mosquitoes and ticks. Don't spray permethrin on your skin, though. For infants younger than 2 months, you can't use insect repellent, so cover their carrier or stroller with mosquito netting. For infants and children older than 2 months old, you can use 10%-30% DEET products. Don't use a combined sunscreen and DEET product because you'll need to reapply sunscreen for a full day of outside play. Reapplying a DEET-containing product can expose your child to high levels of DEET. Get rid of standing water outside your house. Mosquitoes lay their eggs in standing water. Common problem areas for standing water are old flowerpots, flat roofs, old tires, and clogged gutters. Report any sick or dying birds or small animals to your local health department. They could be infected with viruses such as West Nile virus that cause encephalitis. Encephalitis Prognosis Your symptoms can last anywhere from a few days to a couple of months. Some people with complications may take another few months to fully recover. However, with treatment, most people recover from encephalitis. Your outlook depends on a few things, such as: What caused your encephalitis. Some causes, such as an HSV infection, may cause fewer issues, so people with encephalitis caused by HSV may have an easier recovery than other people. Your level of inflammation. High levels of brain inflammation can cause more long-term issues that complicate your recovery. Your age. Adults may have a harder time recovering from encephalitis. Your overall health. If you have preexisting health issues or a weakened immune system, it can make your recovery more difficult. How long it took you to be diagnosed. The longer it takes you to get treatment, the higher your chance of having a difficult recovery and lasting complications. Takeaways Encephalitis is a condition that involves inflammation and swelling in your brain. It's usually caused by infection with a virus, especially HSV. It isn’t always preventable, but you can lower your risk by avoiding infection with a germ that could lead to encephalitis. This means getting your recommended vaccines and avoiding or protecting yourself when in areas that have ticks and mosquitoes. If you have signs or symptoms of encephalitis, you should get to the doctor right away. Quick diagnosis and treatment can make your recovery easier and limit lasting effects. Although some people do experience complications, most people fully recover. Encephalitis FAQs What is the life expectancy of people with encephalitis? Most people fully recover from encephalitis and go on to live a normal life. People with mild cases may recover in a week, while people with serious cases may have complications that take months of added recovery time. One study showed that about 5% of people who are hospitalized with encephalitis die while they are in the hospital. Can encephalitis resolve on its own? If you have mild encephalitis, it can recover on its own over several weeks. Severe cases of encephalitis, however, can be life-threatening. You can't necessarily tell from your symptoms how serious your case is, so if you suspect you have encephalitis, you need to go to the doctor."
37,Alopecia Areata,"What Is Alopecia? Alopecia areata is an autoimmune disorder that causes your hair to come out, often in clumps the size and shape of a quarter. The amount of hair loss is different in everyone. Some people lose it only in a few spots. Others lose a lot. Sometimes, hair grows back but falls out again later. In others, hair grows back for good. There are different types of this condition. Alopecia areata is most common in its main form, but there are other, more rare types: Alopecia areata totalis means you’ve lost all the hair on your head. Alopecia areata universalis is the loss of hair over your entire body. Diffuse alopecia areata is a sudden thinning of your hair rather than lost patches. Ophiasis alopecia areata causes hair loss in a band shape around the sides and back of your head. Alopecia Symptoms Alopecia areata (AA) is a chronic, autoimmune disease and while most associate it with temporary and permanent hair loss, it affects the nails in up to 46% of those affected. AA nails may appear pitted with lines, having splitting and/or white spots. The main and often the only symptom of alopecia is hair loss. You may notice: Small bald patches on your scalp or other parts of your body Patches may get larger and grow together into a bald spot Hair grows back in one spot and falls out in another You lose a lot of hair over a short time More hair loss in cold weather Fingernails and toenails become red, brittle, and pitted The bald patches of skin are smooth, with no rash or redness. But you may feel a tingling, itching , or burning sensation on your skin right before the hair falls out. Alopecia Causes and Risk Factors When you have an autoimmune disease , your immune system attacks your body. With alopecia areata, it’s the hair follicles that are attacked. Doctors don’t know why it happens. But they think people who get it have something in their genes that makes it more likely. Then something happens to trigger the hair loss. Learn more about what causes alopecia . You’re more likely to get alopecia areata if you have: A family member who has it Asthma Down syndrome Pernicious anemia Seasonal allergies Thyroid disease Vitiligo Alopecia Diagnosis If you think you have alopecia areata, you may want to see a skin specialist called a dermatologist. They will: Talk to you about your symptoms Take a close look at the areas where you have hair loss Pull gently on the hairs at the edges of the bald patch to see if they come out easily Check individual hairs and follicles to see if they’re abnormally shaped Examine your nails Rarely, you may have a biopsy , which means a small piece of skin is removed from your scalp and looked at under a microscope. Many conditions can cause hair loss. So your doctor may test your skin for a fungal infection or give you blood tests to check for thyroid , hormone , or immune system problems. Alopecia Treatment Alopecia areata can’t be cured. But it can be treated and hair can grow back. If you have it, there are several things to try: Corticosteroids . These are anti-inflammatory drugs that are prescribed for autoimmune diseases. They can be given as an injection into the scalp or other areas. They can also be given as a pill or rubbed on the skin as an ointment, cream, or foam. The downside is that it may take a long time to work. Topical immunotherapy . This is used when there’s a lot of hair loss or if it happens more than once. Chemicals are applied to the scalp to produce an allergic reaction . If it works, this reaction is actually what makes the hair grow back. It also causes an itchy rash and usually has to be repeated several times to keep the new hair growth. Minoxidil ( Rogaine ) . This treatment, which is put on the scalp, is already used for pattern baldness. It usually takes about 12 weeks before you see growth, and some users are disappointed in the results. Read more about which types of alopecia are most likely to respond to minoxidil . Other treatments for alopecia areata include medications that are sometimes used for other autoimmune disorders. These medicines have differing amounts of success in regrowing hair. Alopecia Home Care Apart from medications, there are other things you can try if you have alopecia areata. Wear wigs, hats, or scarves. They cover your hair loss and will protect your head from the sun. Reduce stress . Personal troubles seem to trigger alopecia areata, although this has not been proven scientifically. Telogen effluvium, another form of hair loss, can also be triggered by stress. Learn more about the signs and symptoms of telogen effluvium . Alopecia Outlook Alopecia areata isn’t usually a serious medical condition, but it can cause a lot of anxiety and sadness. Support groups are out there to help you deal with the psychological effects of the condition. If you lose all your hair, it could grow back. If it doesn’t, there are different ways to cover your hair loss and protect your scalp. If you notice sudden hair loss, always check with a doctor. There can be other reasons for it besides alopecia areata."
38,What Is an Altitude Headache?,"When you're in the mountains to ski, hike, or just take in the view, you could get head pain from something called an altitude headache . It's a symptom of altitude sickness, which happens when you go to higher elevations. The problem usually starts when you're 8,500 feet above sea level. About a quarter of all people get a headache when they reach that height. Causes It's not exactly clear what causes altitude headaches. There's less oxygen as you go higher, and your body may not get enough to nourish all your tissues, a condition called hypoxia. Although hypoxia is part of altitude sickness, doctors still aren't sure if and how it relates to symptoms like headache. What experts do know is that the higher you go, the greater the odds of getting a headache. You can cut your chances if you gradually get your body used to the higher elevation. For example, if you live at sea level, you're more likely to get a headache when you travel to 8,500 feet than someone who already lives at the base of the mountain at, say, 5,000 feet. How fast you go up a peak matters, too. An 8-minute ski lift to the top of the mountain is more likely to give you a headache than a leisurely hike over several days that climbs to the same height. Just beware of pushing yourself too hard at higher altitudes, as with running , climbing, or skiing, which also raises your headache risk. Symptoms Moderate headache pain typically starts as you get up to around 8,500 feet, most often on both sides of the head. You might notice that it worsens as you go higher or when you cough , push yourself hard, or bend over. Another clue that higher altitude caused your headache is that it goes away within 24 hours of getting back below 8,200 feet. Headache is the most common sign of altitude sickness, and one may happen without other symptoms. But there are other typical problems with this illness. You may also feel tired , weak, dizzy, nauseated, and have trouble sleeping . Prevention If you're headed to a higher elevation, the best way to prevent an altitude headache is to go up slowly. You're much more likely to get sick when you go up more than about 1,600 feet per day, especially if your body is working hard. It helps to drink plenty of water , 12 or more cups a day, as you head to higher elevations, and to increase the carbohydrates in your diet to around three-quarters of your calories. Tobacco and alcohol make it harder for your body to get used to higher altitudes, as can medications like barbiturates and sleeping pills. Talk to your doctor about your medicine if you're unsure. Treatment Getting to a lower elevation is the best treatment for altitude headache and altitude sickness in general. In more serious cases, it may help to breathe in some oxygen, which you can carry with you in small canisters, until you can get to a lower elevation. If you tend to get altitude headaches, you may be able to help prevent them if you take medications like furosemide , acetazolamide ( Diamox ), or corticosteroids before you get to high altitudes. You'll need a doctor's prescription for these drugs. Over-the-counter medications like ibuprofen or aspirin might help both before and after the headache starts. The migraine medicine sumatriptan also helps some people. Talk to your doctor about what drugs are best for you if you know you get headaches at higher elevations."
39,Anaplastic Large-Cell Lymphoma,"What Is Anaplastic Large-Cell Lymphoma? Anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL) is a rare type of blood cancer . It's more common in young people, mostly boys. It doesn't run in families. ALCL is a serious illness. It can be fast growing, and it often returns. Treatments can help you fight it. Other therapies can help you feel better. Scientists are still looking for new and better ways to treat both the disease and the symptoms. When you have lymphoma, cells called lymphocytes grow out of control. These are white blood cells that usually fight infection. With ALCL, they build up in small glands called lymph nodes or in other parts of your body, like your lungs or skin . ALCL can show up in two ways: In the skin, it's called cutaneous ALCL . It usually grows slowly. In the lymph nodes and other organs, it's called systemic ALCL. It often spreads quickly. Doctors will also need to find out whether your cancer has a certain protein, called ALK. ALK-positive cancers are more common in young people and usually respond well to chemotherapy . ALK-negative cancers are more common people over 60. This type may need stronger treatment because it is more likely to come back. Causes Researchers don't know what causes ALCL, but they do know it isn't inherited. Symptoms Often, the first sign of systemic ALCL is swelling in the neck, armpit , or groin, where your legs meet the trunk of your body. You may also have symptoms like: Fatigue Fever Loss of appetite Night sweats Weight loss With cutaneous ALCL, you may first notice one or more raised, red bumps on the skin that don't go away. These are tumors. They can form open sores, and they may itch. Getting a Diagnosis When you come in for a visit, your doctor will want to know: When did you first notice changes? Are there any swollen glands ? Is there pain? Where? What about appetite? Any weight loss? More tired than usual? Any skin bumps? Do they itch? To see if you have ALCL, doctors may take a biopsy from a swollen lymph node . It's quick and doesn't require a hospital stay. Doctors make a small cut in the skin and remove all or part of the lymph node, or use a needle to take a sample. They look at the cells under a microscope. Other tests may be needed, such as: Blood tests Bone marrow biopsy . Doctors use a special needle to remove a small amount of the soft material inside your bones and check it for cancer cells. Chest X-ray, which uses radiation in low doses to make images of organs in your chest. CT. A powerful X-ray that makes detailed pictures of the inside of your body. MRI , which uses powerful magnets and radio waves to make pictures of organs and structures. PET scan , in which radioactive materials called tracers look for cancer . These tests look to see where and how much the cancer has spread. This is called staging. It helps you and your doctor decide the right treatment. Stage I. Cancer is found in one place as a tumor or in the lymph nodes in only one part of the body, like the neck or groin. Stage II. Cancer can also be found in a single tumor and its nearby lymph nodes of only one part of the body. All of the lymph nodes are either above or below the diaphragm, a sheet of muscle between your chest and stomach . Stage III. Cancer is found in lymph nodes both above and below the diaphragm and is outside the lymphatic system. Stage IV. ALCL has spread to other organs, such as the liver , bones, or lungs . Questions to Ask Your Doctor What stage is the cancer? Where exactly have you found cancer? Is it ALK-positive? Have you treated someone with ALCL before? What treatment do you recommend? What are the side effects? How and when will we know if it works? What if it doesn't work? Could I be in a clinical trial ? How do I connect with other families facing ALCL? Treatment No matter what form of ALCL you have, there are treatments to help. And researchers are hopeful tthere will be new and better options in the future. Your treatment choices will depend on the type of ALCL you have and where it is in the body. Chemotherapy is the main treatment for systemic ALCL, when the cancer is in your lymph nodes and other parts of the body. A kind of chemotherapy called CHOP is used for both ALK-positive and ALK-negative ALCL. The therapy gets its name for the first letters of the drugs it uses: C ytoxan, h ydroxydaunorubicin, O ncovin, and p rednisolone . If your cancer is ALK-negative, doctors may use CHOP at higher doses. If your cancer doesn't respond to CHOP, you may get another drug called brentuximab vedotin ( Adcetris ). A stem cell transplant may also be an option for you, but it's a complicated and risky procedure. It's usually only done when other treatments have failed. Doctors inject stem cells into your body to help you grow new cancer-free ones. The stem cells come from your own body, or from a closely matched donor. For primary cutaneous ALCL, treatment may include: Radiation, which uses high-energy rays to kill cancer cells Surgery to remove the tumors If the cancer is in many areas of the skin, you may need a combination of chemotherapy drugs. Taking Care of Yourself Being diagnosed with cancer can make you feel like you've lost control. Remember that you're in charge of your treatment decisions and how you live your life. While you are getting treatment, you may not feel your best. Some treatments, like chemotherapy, have side effects. You may feel weak or tired, and you may be sick to your stomach To help you feel better: Eat enough calories and protein each day to keep up weight and stay strong. Try several small meals instead of fewer bigger ones. Ask the doctor or nurse for ways to ease nausea and other side effects of treatment. Get support from friends, family members, counselors, or members of your spiritual community. You can also join a support group of other people with ALCL. Stay active. Exercise when you feel up to it. Talk to your doctor about what's right for you. Try to get good rest. Wash hands often, and stay away from people who may be sick. Don't miss regular doctor appointments. They're key to finding out how well the treatment is going, and to deciding if any changes are needed. What to Expect Every situation is different, but treatment to fight ALCL can work well. Sometimes, the cancer comes back. Ask your doctor what to watch for, and listen to your body. The treatments can bring discomfort. Make sure your doctor knows how you're feeling. Take advantage of other therapies that can ease symptoms and help you feel better. A serious illness is hard for the whole family. It's natural that you will have questions, concerns, and frustrations. Find the support you need, and ask for help when you need it. Keep informed about research that's under way. You may be able to take part in a clinical trial. Getting Support You can find out more information on anaplastic large-cell lymphoma on the web site of the Lymphoma Research Foundation . It has links to help you find the support of people and families who have ALCL, and to information about clinical trials."
40,Angina (Ischemic Chest Pain),"What Is Angina? Angina is chest pain that happens because there isn't enough blood going to part of your heart. It can feel like a heart attack, with pressure or squeezing in your chest. It's sometimes called angina pectoris or ischemic chest pain. It's a symptom of heart disease, and it happens when something blocks your arteries or there's not enough blood flow in the arteries that bring oxygen-rich blood to your heart. With angina, pain in your chest can spread to your shoulders, arms, neck, throat, jaw, or back. (Image credit: Rob3000 / Dreamstime) Angina usually goes away quickly. Still, it can be a sign of a life-threatening heart problem. It's important to find out what's going on and what you can do to avoid a heart attack. Usually, medicine and lifestyle changes can control angina. If it's more serious, you may need surgery. Or you may need what's called a stent, a tiny tube that props open arteries. Angina vs. heart attack Heart disease can also cause a heart attack. The decrease in blood flow to your heart in a heart attack is longer than that in angina. This causes part of the heart muscle to die, which is permanent damage. The drop in blood flow to your heart in angina is short. So it doesn't cause permanent damage. Angina Types There are different types of angina: Stable angina This is the most common type of angina. Physical activity or stress can trigger it. It usually lasts a few minutes, and it goes away when you rest. It isn't a heart attack, but it can be a sign that you're more likely to have one. Tell your doctor if this happens to you. Unstable angina You can have unstable angina while you're at rest or not very active. The pain can be strong and long-lasting, and it may come back again and again. It can be a signal that you're about to have a heart attack , so see a doctor right away. Microvascular angina With microvascular angina, you have chest pain but no coronary artery blockage. Instead, it happens because your smallest coronary arteries aren't working the way they should, so your heart doesn't get the blood it needs. The chest pain usually lasts more than 10 minutes. This type is more common in women. Prinzmetal's angina (variant angina) This type of angina is rare. It might happen at night while you're sleeping or resting. Your heart arteries suddenly tighten or narrow. It can cause a lot of pain , and you should get it treated. Angina Symptoms Chest pain is the symptom, but it affects people differently. You may have: Aching Burning Discomfort Dizziness Fatigue Feeling of fullness in your chest Feeling of heaviness or pressure Upset stomach or vomiting Shortness of breath Squeezing Sweating You might mistake an aching or burning for heartburn or gas . You're likely to have pain behind your breastbone, which can spread to your shoulders, arms, neck, throat, jaw, or back. Stable angina often gets better with rest. Unstable angina may not, and it could get worse. It's an emergency that needs medical help right away. Angina symptoms by sex Men often feel pain in their chest, neck, and shoulders. Women may feel discomfort in their belly, neck, jaw, throat, or back. You may also have shortness of breath, sweating, or dizziness. One study found that women were more likely to use the words ""pressing"" or ""crushing"" to describe the feeling. Heart Attack Symptoms You get a heart attack when blood flow to your heart muscle gets restricted or blocked, often by a clot in an artery . Without oxygen, your heart muscle gets damaged or could even die. A 2008 study in the American Journal of Critical Care found that chest pain is the most frequently reported heart attack symptom, and 61% of 256 participants said their symptoms were constant. Your chest pain may feel like: Discomfort Pressure Tightness Burning Fullness Squeezing ""If you've not experienced it before, patients often aren't sure what it is when it first comes on,"" says Kristin Newby, MD, a cardiologist at the Duke Heart Center in Durham, NC. The same study found that women were about 8 years older than men when they began to have heart trouble and were more likely to report a higher intensity of five other symptoms: Indigestion Palpitations Nausea Numbness in the hands Unusual and overwhelming fatigue The study found that 21% of women and 10% of men had no symptoms. Less typical symptoms for both men and women are: Discomfort in the neck, arms, jaw, back, or stomach Shortness of breath Dizziness Cold sweat ""Men and women may respond differently to the symptoms of a heart attack, particularly if the symptoms are vague. But if you have symptoms consistent with a heart attack, don't wait at home. Go to the hospital,"" says Alfred Sacchetti, MD, an emergency room doctor. Angina Causes Angina usually happens because of heart disease. A fatty substance called plaque builds up in your arteries, blocking blood flow to your heart muscle. This forces your heart to work with less oxygen, which causes pain. You may also have blood clots in the arteries of your heart, which can cause heart attacks. Less common causes of chest pain include: A blockage in a major artery of your lungs (pulmonary embolism) An enlarged or thickened heart (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy) Narrowing of a valve in the main part of your heart ( aortic stenosis ) Swelling of the sac around your heart (pericarditis) Tearing in the wall of your aorta, the largest artery in your body (aortic dissection) Angina Risk Factors Some things about you or your lifestyle could put you at a higher risk of angina, including: Older age Family history of heart disease High blood pressure High cholesterol Diabetes Obesity Stress Smoking Not getting enough exercise Angina Diagnosis Your doctor will do a physical exam and ask about your symptoms, risk factors, and family history. They might need to do tests including: EKG. This test measures your heart's electrical activity and rhythm. Stress test. This checks how your heart is working while you exercise. Blood tests. Your doctor will check for proteins called troponins . Lots of them are released when your heart muscle is damaged, as in a heart attack. Your doctor may also do more general tests like a metabolic panel or complete blood count. Imaging tests. Chest X-rays can rule out other things that might be causing your chest pain, like lung conditions. Echocardiograms and CT and MRI scans can create images of your heart to help your doctor spot problems. Cardiac catheterization. Your doctor inserts a long, thin tube into an artery in your leg and threads it up to your heart to check your blood flow and pressure. Coronary angiography. Your doctor injects dye into the blood vessels of your heart. The dye shows up on an X-ray , creating an image of your blood vessels. They may do this procedure during cardiac catheterization. Angina questions for your doctor Do I need any more tests? What type of angina do I have? Do I have heart damage? What treatment do you recommend? How will it make me feel? What can I do to try to prevent a heart attack? Are there activities I shouldn't do? Will changing my diet help? Angina Treatment Your treatment depends on how much damage there is to your heart. For people with mild angina, medicine and lifestyle changes can often help their blood flow better and control their symptoms. Medicines Your doctor might prescribe medicines including: Nitrates or calcium channel blockers to relax and widen blood vessels, letting more blood flow to your heart Beta-blockers to slow your heart down so it doesn't have to work as hard Blood thinners or antiplatelet medications to prevent blood clots Statins to lower your cholesterol levels and stabilize plaque Cardiac procedures If meds aren't enough, you may need to have blocked arteries opened with a medical procedure or surgery. This could be: Angioplasty/stenting. The doctor threads a tiny tube, with a balloon inside, through a blood vessel and up to your heart. Then, they inflate the balloon inside the narrowed artery to widen it and restore blood flow. They may insert a small tube called a stent inside your artery to help keep it open. The stent is permanent and usually made of metal. It can also be made of a material that your body absorbs over time. Some stents also have medicine that helps keep your artery from getting blocked again. The procedure usually takes less than 2 hours. You'll probably stay overnight at the hospital. Coronary artery bypass grafting or bypass surgery. Your surgeon takes healthy arteries or veins from another part of your body and uses them to go around the blocked or narrowed blood vessels. You can expect to stay in the hospital for about a week after you have this. You'll be in the intensive care unit for 1 or 2 days while nurses and doctors keep a close eye on your heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen levels. You'll then move to a regular room to recover. Enhanced external counterpulsation (EECP) EECP may be an option to relieve your angina. Your doctor may recommend it if other treatments haven't worked or aren't right for you. EECP uses several blood pressure cuffs on both legs to gently, but firmly, compress the blood vessels there to boost blood flow to your heart. Each wave is timed to your heartbeat. So more blood goes there when it's relaxing. When your heart pumps again, pressure is released right away. This lets blood to be pumped more easily. It can help your blood vessels make a natural bypass around narrowed or blocked arteries that cause your chest pain. It may help some small blood vessels in your heart open. They may give more blood flow to your heart muscle to help ease your chest pain. You might have EECP if you: Have chronic stable chest pain Aren't helped by nitrates, calcium channel blockers, and beta-blockers Invasive procedures like bypass surgery, angioplasty, or stenting aren't right for you EECP isn't invasive. If you're accepted for EECP treatment, you'll have 35 hours of therapy. It's given 1-2 hours a day, 5 days a week, for 7 weeks. Studies show its benefits include less need for angina medicine, fewer symptoms, and the ability to be more active without symptoms. Angina Outlook Angina raises your risk of having a heart attack. But it's treatable. Consider it a warning sign and make healthy choices. Talk with others who have it. This may help you learn how to feel better. Your family, too, may need support to help them understand your angina . They'll want to know what they can do to help. Lifestyle changes You can still be active, but it's important to listen to your body. If you feel pain, stop what you're doing and rest. Know what triggers your angina, like stress or intense exercise. Try to avoid things that tend to set it off. For example, if large meals cause problems, eat smaller ones and eat more often. If you still feel pain, talk to your doctor about having more tests or changing your medications. Because angina can be a sign of something dangerous, it's important to get checked out. These lifestyle tips may help protect your heart: If you smoke, stop because it can damage your blood vessels and increase your heart disease risk. Eat a heart-healthy diet to lower your blood pressure and cholesterol levels. When those are out of normal range, your chance for heart disease can rise. Eat mainly fruits and vegetables, whole grains, fish, lean meat, and fat-free or low-fat dairy. Limit salt, fat, and sugar. Do things to cut down on stress like meditation, deep breathing, or yoga to relax. Exercise most days of the week. See your doctor regularly . If you have chest pain that is new or unusual for you and you think you may be having a heart attack, call 911 right away. Quick treatment is very important. It can protect you from more damage. Takeaways Angina is chest pain that happens when the flow of blood to your heart briefly decreases. Angina does not cause permanent damage to your heart like a heart attack does. It can be treated with medication or medical procedures like having a stent or a tiny balloon to help open the arteries. Sometimes, coronary bypass surgery is needed. Getting exercise, eating a nutritious diet, and watching your stress level are among the things you can do that can help keep your heart healthier. Angina FAQs Does angina mean a heart attack? Angina means chest pain. It can sometimes signal a heart attack. Angina can be a sign of very serious heart issues. When you have chest pain, it's important to see a doctor right away. How can I remove gas trapped in my chest? Gas can get trapped in your digestive system if you can't burp it out or pass it out. Sometimes, if it's in the upper part of your digestive tract, it can make your chest hurt. You need to find out the source of any of chest pain you may have. If you're having other symptoms that might mean you're having a heart attack or angina (see above), get medical help right away. Chest pain from gas can come after you eat or drink something that causes the gas to form. Burping or passing the gas is the fastest way to get rid of it, but if it's trapped, you might try: A heating pad to help relax your belly area Over-the-counter anti-gas medicine with simethicone Ginger—in tea, candied, or even ginger powder in water Gently rubbing your belly Easy exercise, like walking or yoga poses"
41,Apert Syndrome,"Apert syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that causes abnormal development of the skull. Babies with Apert syndrome are born with a distorted shape of the head and face. Many children with Apert syndrome also have other birth defects. Apert syndrome has no cure, but surgery can help correct some of the problems that result. Causes of Apert Syndrome Apert syndrome is caused by a rare mutation on a single gene. This mutated gene is normally responsible for guiding bones to join together at the right time during development. In almost all cases, the Apert syndrome gene mutation seems to be random. Only about one in 65,000 babies is born with Apert syndrome. Apert Syndrome Symptoms The defective gene in babies with Apert syndrome allows the skull bones to fuse together prematurely, a process called craniosynostosis. The brain continues to grow inside the abnormal skull, putting pressure on the bones in the skull and face. The abnormal skull and facial growth in Apert syndrome produce its main signs and symptoms: A head that is long, with a high forehead Wide-set, bulging eyes , often with poorly-closing eyelids A sunken middle face Other Apert syndrome symptoms also result from the abnormal skull growth: Poor intellectual development (in some children with Apert syndrome) Obstructive sleep apnea Repeated ear or sinus infections Hearing loss Crowded teeth due to underdevelopment of the jaw Abnormal fusion of the bones of the hands and feet (syndactyly) -- with webbed or mitten-like hands or feet -- are also common Apert syndrome symptoms. Some children with Apert syndrome also have heart , gastrointestinal, or urinary system problems. Apert Syndrome Diagnosis Doctors often suspect Apert syndrome or another craniosynostosis syndrome at birth because of a newborn's appearance. Genetic testing can usually identify Apert syndrome or another cause of abnormal skull formation. Apert Syndrome Treatments Apert syndrome has no known cure. Surgery to correct the abnormal connections between bones is the main treatment for Apert syndrome. In general, surgery for Apert syndrome takes place in three steps: 1. Release of skull bone fusion (craniosynostosis release). A surgeon separates the abnormally fused skull bones and partially rearranges some of them. This surgery is usually performed when a child is between ages 6 and 8 months. 2. Midface advancement. As the child with Apert syndrome grows, the facial bones again become misaligned. A surgeon cuts the bones in the jaw and cheeks and brings them forward into a more normal position. This surgery may be done at any time between ages 4 and 12. Additional corrective surgery may be needed, especially when midface advancement is done at a young age. 3. Correction of wide-set eyes (hypertelorism correction). A surgeon removes a wedge of bone in the skull between the eyes. The surgeon brings the eye sockets closer together, and may adjust the jaw, too. Other Apert syndrome treatments include: Eyedrops during the day, with lubricating eye ointment at night; these drops can prevent the dangerous eye drying that can occur in Apert syndrome. Continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ); a child with Apert syndrome and obstructive sleep apnea may wear a mask at night, attached to a small machine. The machine delivers pressure that keeps the child's airways open during sleep. Antibiotics . Children with Apert syndrome are prone to ear and sinus infections caused by bacteria, requiring antibiotic therapy. Surgical tracheostomy, or placement of a breathing tube in the neck; this surgery may be done for children with severe obstructive sleep apnea due to Apert syndrome. Surgical placement of ear tubes (myringotomy), for children with repeated ear infections due to Apert syndrome Other surgeries may be beneficial for certain children with Apert syndrome, depending on their individual pattern of facial bone formation problems. Apert Syndrome Prognosis Children with Apert syndrome usually require surgery for release of the skull bones to allow a chance for the brain to develop normally. The older a child is before this surgery is performed, the lower the chance for reaching normal intellectual ability. Even with early surgery, certain brain structures may remain poorly developed, however. In general, children who are raised by their parents have a better chance of achieving normal intellectual ability. About four in 10 children with Apert syndrome who are raised in a healthy family environment reach a normal intelligence quotient (IQ). Among Apert syndrome children who are institutionalized, only about one in 18 achieves a normal IQ. In one study, three of 136 children with Apert syndrome eventually attended college. Children with Apert syndrome and other similar conditions who have normal IQs do not seem to have an increased risk of behavioral or emotional problems. However, they may require additional social and emotional support to help cope with their condition. Children with Apert syndrome with lower IQs often do have behavioral and emotional problems. There can be wide variability between children with Apert syndrome, with some severely affected, and others only mildly affected. Experts are unsure why the same gene mutation can result in such variation in a child's Apert syndrome prognosis. Life expectancy also varies between children with Apert syndrome. Those with Apert syndrome who survive past childhood and don't have heart problems likely have a normal or near-normal life expectancy. Life expectancy is likely improving because of advances in surgical techniques and follow-up care."
42,What to Know About Antiphospholipid Syndrome,"What Is Antiphospholipid Syndrome? Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is a rare immune system disorder that can cause clots to form in your blood vessels. This raises your risk for several types of health problems, including heart attack, stroke, and miscarriage. Your immune system normally makes proteins called antibodies to protect you from unhealthy invaders like viruses. But when you have antiphospholipid syndrome, it makes antibodies that attack fat molecules throughout your body. That leads to cell damage, which makes your blood more likely to form clots in arteries and veins. The clots can form nearly anywhere in your body, from your brain to your lungs to your legs. Scientists aren't sure exactly what causes APS, which is most common in young women (and those assigned female at birth). There's no cure, but treatment can help prevent blood clots from forming. Antiphospholipid Syndrome Causes and Risk Factors Antiphospholipid syndrome causes About 1%-5% of people in the U.S. have such abnormal antibodies in their blood that can lead to antiphospholipid syndrome. But some people with these antibodies never show any signs of the disease. To be diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome, you must have both the antibodies and APS symptoms. As with other autoimmune disorders, it's not clear what causes these antibodies to develop. Scientists think both genes and things in your environment are involved. Antiphospholipid syndrome risk factors Your chances of getting APS are higher if you: Are female or were assigned female at birth (some 70% of those with APS are female) Have a bacterial or viral infection, such as HIV , syphilis , hepatitis C , or Lyme disease Take the antibiotic amoxicillin or certain blood pressure , heart-rhythm, and anti-seizure medications Have lupus (up to about half of people with lupus also have APS) or another autoimmune disorder Have relatives with APS If you have APS antibodies, you're more likely to develop blood clot symptoms when you: Get pregnant Have surgery Have obesity Sit for a long time (for example, on bed rest or a long flight) Smoke Take birth control pills Have high cholesterol or high blood pressure Antiphospholipid Syndrome in Pregnancy Antiphospholipid syndrome affects five times as many women as men and is most often diagnosed in women in their 30s. That's one reason it’s linked to pregnancy complications. Another reason is that pregnancy increases your risk for blood clots even when you don't have APS antibodies. More blood flows through your body to help support the fetus. This puts extra pressure on your blood vessels, which can make them narrower. Pregnancy hormones also make clotting more likely. Pregnancy complications linked to APS include: A hard time getting pregnant Preeclampsia (high blood pressure) Miscarriage, usually after the 10th week of pregnancy Premature birth, usually before the 34th week of pregnancy Babies born small or underweight Treatment for APS can reduce your risk for these complications. How does antiphospholipid syndrome cause miscarriages? Scientists think that blood clots in the placenta, the organ that provides nutrition and oxygen to the fetus during pregnancy, are to blame. The clots are thought to block the flow of nutrients through the placenta and into the umbilical cord, which keeps them from reaching the fetus. Antiphospholipid Syndrome Symptoms Blood clots are the most common symptom of antiphospholipid syndrome. Their symptoms vary depending on where in your body the clot forms. They may include: Pain in your chest Nausea Shortness of breath Pain, redness, and swelling in your legs or arms Changes in your speech pattern Discomfort in your neck, back, arms, and jaws Repeated miscarriages Other symptoms might include: Bleeding from your nose or gums resulting from low levels of platelets (cells that help your blood clot) Anemia, which happens when you don't have enough red blood cells A rash that makes a lacy red or purplish pattern on your skin Damage to your heart valves Frequent headaches Memory problems If you think you're having symptoms of a blood clot, get medical help immediately. Clots can be dangerous and even deadly. Antiphospholipid Syndrome Complications Blood clots due to antiphospholipid syndrome can cause complications that may be serious, such as: Deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ). It involves the formation of a blood clot in the deep veins of the leg (the ones closest to the bones), which carry a lot of blood to the heart . DVT can also occur in other areas, such as the arms and pelvis. APS causes 15%-20% of deep vein thrombosis cases. Pulmonary embolism . A blood clot in your lungs can block one of the arteries there, causing this potentially life-threatening condition. It most often happens after a clot in a deep leg vein breaks off and travels to your lungs. APS can also lead to high blood pressure in your lungs. Heart attack. This can happen when a blood clot in your heart blocks arteries there and stops blood and oxygen from flowing as it should. Stroke . Strokes result from clots in the blood vessels of the brain. They can cause speech loss, paralysis to parts of your body, and other issues that are sometimes permanent. APS can also lead to a less serious transient ischemic attack (TIA) or mini-stroke. Kidney damage. R educed blood flow to your kidneys can result in kidney problems, including kidney failure. Catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome is a very rare and dangerous complication in which many blood clots suddenly form throughout your body. This can damage multiple organs within a short time. Scientists don't know why this happens, but it sometimes follows an infection, injury, or surgery. Antiphospholipid Syndrome Diagnosis Antiphospholipid antibody test If your doctor suspects you have APS, they'll give you blood tests to look for the three APS antibodies: Anticardiolipin Beta-2 glycoprotein I (β2GPI) Lupus anticoagulant You'll need to be tested two times, at least 12 weeks apart. At least one of the three blood tests must come back positive twice for you to be diagnosed with APS. Antiphospholipid syndrome criteria Just having the antibodies doesn’t mean that you have antiphospholipid syndrome. You also must have a history of health problems related to it. Most cases of APS are diagnosed after a clotting incident or a series of miscarriages. Antiphospholipid Syndrome Treatments There's no cure for antiphospholipid syndrome, but treatment can protect against complications. The goal of treatment is to stop new blood clots from forming and keep any you already have from growing larger. A combination of blood thinning drugs (anticoagulants) is the standard treatment. Most people take fast-heparin as a shot along with a slower-acting blood thinner in pill form called warfarin (Jantoven). Low-dose aspirin is another blood thinner. You're at higher risk for bleeding when you take these drugs, so your doctor will keep an eye on that. APS treatment during pregnancy Treatment helps prevent miscarriages and other pregnancy complications of APS. During p regnancy, you can get injections of heparin up until just before delivery. You may also take low doses of aspirin. But warfarin isn't safe during pregnancy. If you've had repeated miscarriages, your doctor may treat you with: Enoxaparin, an anticoagulant you get in a shot Corticosteroids, which suppress an overactive immune system Immunoglobulin, another drug used to treat immune system disorders, which you get through an IV Living With Antiphospholipid Syndrome If you have antiphospholipid syndrome, you'll probably need to take medication for the rest of your life. Warfarin can interact with many other medications, so inform your doctor about all prescription or over-the-counter drugs you take. If you take low-dose aspirin to treat APS, be careful about taking over-the-counter painkillers or cough medications that might also contain aspirin. Blood thinners can lead to excessive bleeding. So, call your doctor right away if you notice any of these signs: Heavier-than-usual periods Nosebleeds Bleeding from your gums Blood in your poop or poop that looks black Vomit that's red or looks like coffee grounds Sudden vision problems Serious head or abdominal (belly) pain Trouble moving your arms or legs It’s also important for people with APS to get treatment for other conditions that raise their risk for blood clots, such as: High blood pressure High cholesterol Obesity Diabetes Other autoimmune disorders Avoid estrogen therapy (such as for menopause symptoms or birth control ), which also makes clotting more likely. Lifestyle changes If you're diagnosed with APS, stop smoking , which harms your blood vessels and raises your risk for clots. Ask your doctor if you need help quitting. Keeping your weight in a healthy range reduces your risk for other conditions that make blood clotting more likely, such as heart disease. A balanced diet that's rich in fruits and vegetables can help with weight control. But if you take heparin, don't suddenly add large amounts of foods rich in vitamin K to your diet without talking to your doctor first. These include leafy greens such as kale, spinach, and collard greens. Too much vitamin K could keep heparin from working as it should. These foods are healthy, so there's no need to avoid them completely. Tell your doctor if you want to increase your intake so they can monitor your blood. If you take blood thinners, ask your doctor before taking supplements that may raise your risk of bleeding, such as: Ginger Ginkgo Vitamin E Avoid drinking more than two or three alcoholic drinks a day while taking warfarin. Alcohol can interfere with the drug's effectiveness. So can large amounts of cranberry juice; drink it in moderation. Regular physical activity also helps reduce your risk of conditions such as diabetes and heart disease. If you take blood thinners, your doctor may recommend that you avoid contact sports that could lead to injury. Takeaways Antiphospholipid syndrome is an immune system disorder that makes your blood more likely to clot. This can lead to several health problems. While there's no cure, treatment can protect you against complications. Antiphospholipid Syndrome FAQs What is the main cause of antiphospholipid syndrome? Sometimes a health condition, such as lupus or another autoimmune disorder, causes you to develop APS. That's called secondary antiphospholipid syndrome. But you can get APS even if you don't have another condition (primary phospholipid syndrome). Scientists think genetics is at least partly to blame. What is the life expectancy of someone with antiphospholipid syndrome? Most people with APS can expect to live normal, active lives, especially if they get prompt treatment. Less than 1% of people with APS go on to develop catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (CAPS), which causes blood clots throughout the body that damage multiple organs. About half of those with CAPS die from these complications. Can antiphospholipid syndrome go away? The condition affects different people in different ways. It's possible to have just one episode of APS symptoms and then get better. The abnormal antibodies that lead to APS can increase or decrease. A few people can even stop making these antibodies altogether."
43,Could Your Child Have Sleep Apnea?,"When her son was in preschool, Cynthia Chin-Lee remembers teachers saying he would fall asleep during playtime. At age 10,  Joshua was impossible to rouse in the mornings, saying, ""I need to sleep 10 more minutes. Leave me alone."" Joshua seemed tired, had bags under his eyes , and wasn't doing well in school, explains Chin-Lee, 53, a manager at a software company in Palo Alto, Calif. Chin-Lee's husband had a theory: Maybe their son had sleep apnea , a condition with which her husband had recently been diagnosed. Risk Factors for Children's Sleep Apnea Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a sleep-related breathing disorder affecting more than 18 million adults and 2% to 3% of children of all ages, even newborns, according to the National Sleep Foundation. It seems to run in families, and kids who have enlarged tonsils and/or adenoids (lymph nodes in the throat behind the nose) have a higher risk of developing OSA. Other factors include being obese, having a small jaw or midface, or a larger-than-usual tongue , being exposed to tobacco smoke, and having less muscle tone (such as in children with Down syndrome, cerebral palsy , and/or neuromuscular disorders), explains Dennis Rosen, MD, associate medical director of the Center for Pediatric Sleep Disorders at Boston Children's Hospital. Treating Children's Sleep Apnea Sleep apnea , derived from the Greek word for ""without breath,"" is a serious condition. Breathing temporarily pauses during sleep for more than 10 seconds in adults and longer than two breath cycles in children, and this can happen up to 70 times an hour. Oxygen levels in the blood plummet, and the body responds as if choking. Sometimes young children outgrow OSA as their throats get larger and airways stiffen, says Rosen. Those with large tonsils and adenoids may need surgery (adenotonsillectomy), which typically cures 80% to 90% of children, says Rosen. Joshua was diagnosed with OSA and needs additional treatment since tonsil surgery was unsuccessful. His parents are consulting another sleep specialist. ""I'm relieved I have a diagnosis,"" says Chin-Lee. ""A lot of people, and probably a lot of kids, have sleep apnea and don't know it."" Symptoms of Sleep Apnea Think your child might have obstructive sleep apnea ? Look for these symptoms, Rosen says. Loud snoring , often with gasping, choking, and snorts Long pauses in breathing while sleeping (longer than two breath cycles) Excessive sweating at night because of the strain of trying to breathe Waking up with headaches and daytime sleepiness, irritability, hyperactivity, and difficulty concentrating Find more articles, browse back issues, and read the current issue of ""WebMD the Magazine."""
44,Appendicitis,"What Is Appendicitis? Appendicitis is an inflammation of the appendix . It's a medical emergency that almost always requires surgery as soon as possible to remove the appendix. Luckily, you can live just fine without it. Where Is Your Appendix? This 3 1/2-inch-long tube of tissue extends from your large intestine on the lower right side of your body. The appendix has specialized tissue that can make antibodies, but no one is completely sure what its function is. What Causes Appendicitis? In the U.S., 1 in 20 people will get appendicitis at some point in their lives. Although it can strike at any age, appendicitis is rare in children younger than 2. It’s most likely to affect people between the ages of 10 and 30. Appendicitis happens when the appendix gets blocked, often by poop, a foreign body (something inside you that isn’t supposed to be there), or cancer . Blockage may also result from infection, since the appendix can swell in response to any infection in the body. What Are the Symptoms of Appendicitis? The classic symptoms of appendicitis include: Pain in your lower right belly or pain near your navel that moves lower. This is usually the first sign. Loss of appetite Nausea and vomiting soon after belly pain begins Swollen belly Fever of 99-102 F Can’t pass gas Other less common symptoms of appendicitis include: Dull or sharp pain anywhere in your upper or lower belly, back, or rear end Painful or difficult peeing Vomiting before your belly pain starts Severe cramps Constipation or diarrhea with gas If you have any of these symptoms, see a doctor right away. Timely diagnosis and treatment are important. Don’t eat, drink, or use any pain remedies, antacids, laxatives, or heating pads. How Is Appendicitis Diagnosed? Diagnosing appendicitis can be tricky. Symptoms are often unclear or similar to those of other illnesses, including gallbladder problems , bladder or urinary tract infection , Crohn's disease , gastritis , kidney stones , intestinal infection, and ovary problems. These tests can help diagnose appendicitis: Examination of your abdomen to look for inflammation Urine (pee) test to rule out a urinary tract infection Rectal exam Blood test to see whether your body is fighting an infection CT scans Ultrasound What Is the Treatment for Appendicitis? Appendicitis is almost always treated as an emergency. Surgery to remove the appendix, which is called an appendectomy, is the standard treatment for almost all cases of appendicitis. Generally, if your doctor suspects that you have appendicitis, they will quickly remove it to avoid a rupture. If you have an abscess , you may get two procedures: one to drain the abscess of pus and fluid, and a later one to take out the appendix. But some research shows that treating acute appendicitis with antibiotics may help you avoid surgery. What to Expect During an Appendectomy Before your appendix is taken out, you’ll take antibiotics to fight infection. You’ll usually get general anesthesia , meaning you’ll be asleep for the procedure. The doctor removes your appendix through a 4-inch-long cut or with a device called a laparoscope (a thin telescope-like tool that lets them see inside your belly). This procedure is called laparoscopy. If you have peritonitis , the surgeon will also clean out your belly and drain the pus. You can get up and move around within 12 hours after surgery. You should be able to go back to your normal routine in 2 to 3 weeks. If you had a laparoscopy, recovery is faster. After an appendectomy, call your doctor if you have: Uncontrolled vomiting Increased belly pain Dizziness/feelings of faintness Blood in your vomit or pee Increased pain and redness where your doctor cut into your belly Fever Pus in the wound Appendicitis Complications Left untreated, an inflamed appendix will burst, spilling bacteria and debris into the abdominal cavity, the central part of your body that holds your liver, stomach, and intestines. This can lead to peritonitis, a serious inflammation of the abdominal cavity's lining (the peritoneum). It can be deadly unless it is treated quickly with strong antibiotics and surgery to remove the pus. Sometimes, an abscess forms outside an inflamed appendix. Scar tissue then ""walls off"" the appendix from the rest of your organs. This keeps the infection from spreading. But an abscessed appendix can tear and lead to peritonitis. Appendicitis Prevention There’s no way to prevent appendicitis. But it may be less common in people who eat foods high in fiber, such as fresh fruits and vegetables ."
45,"Apraxia: Symptoms, Causes, Tests, Treatments","What Is Apraxia? Apraxia is a neurological condition that makes it difficult or impossible to make certain movements. This happens even though your muscles are normal and you have the understanding and desire to make these movements. It's caused by damage to your brain that keeps it from forming and giving instructions to your body. It can affect you in several different ways, depending on what type you have. Dyspraxia Milder forms of apraxia are known as dyspraxia. This condition starts in childhood and causes problems with movement and coordination. It can affect both your fine and gross motor skills, as well as your balance and motor planning. This may make it hard to do things like riding a bike, writing, or tying your shoe. Dyspraxia isn’t as severe as apraxia because you only lose part of your motor ability. With apraxia, you totally lose your ability to make certain movements. You might also hear dyspraxia called developmental coordination disorder (DCD). Types of Apraxia There are multiple forms of apraxia, and each affects your body differently. Apraxia of speech With apraxia of speech, sometimes called verbal apraxia, it's hard or impossible to move your mouth and tongue to form words. This happens even though you have the desire to speak and your mouth and tongue muscles are physically able to form words. There are two forms of apraxia of speech -- acquired apraxia and childhood apraxia of speech: Acquired apraxia of speech. Also known as verbal apraxia or oral apraxia, it can affect people of all ages, though it's usually found in adults. It causes you to lose the speech-making abilities you once had. When it affects adults, it's sometimes called adult apraxia of speech. Childhood apraxia of speech. This is a motor speech disorder that you're born with. It affects a child's ability to form sounds and words. It isn’t a muscle issue; it happens because your child’s brain has a hard time planning for and directing the movements of their lips, jaw, and tongue. Children who have it are often far better at understanding speech than at expressing themselves with spoken words. Most children with childhood apraxia of speech can get much better, if not recover completely, with the right treatment. Oral apraxia This disorder affects the movements of your jaw, lips, tongue, and palate. Along with speech issues, it can cause problems with eating and drinking. Ideational apraxia With this condition, your brain can't make a plan for motor tasks that require multiple steps, such as brushing your teeth. Ideomotor apraxia This is the most common type of apraxia. When you have it, you’re unable to follow instructions or copy the actions of someone else to make movements with your head, arms, or legs. This includes things such as waving and using a hammer. Conceptual apraxia This is similar to ideomotor apraxia, but it’s more serious because your brain doesn’t understand how tools are used. For instance, you may try to use a hammer as a screwdriver or a pen. Buccofacial apraxia Also known as orofacial apraxia, this condition makes you unable to voluntarily make certain movements involving your facial muscles. For instance, you may not be able to lick your lips or wink. Oculomotor apraxia With this condition, you have a hard time moving your eyes in the direction you want. Constructional apraxia When you have constructional apraxia, you can’t draw or copy simple shapes or build simple objects. Limb-kinetic apraxia With this condition, you have a hard time moving a finger, arm, or leg exactly the way you want to. For example, you may be unable to button a shirt. Apraxia vs. Aphasia Apraxia is sometimes confused with aphasia , another communication disorder. That confusion can be complicated by the fact that the two conditions can occur together. People with apraxia and aphasia might both have trouble expressing themselves with words. But there are differences between the two conditions. Aphasia is a condition that affects your ability to understand or use words effectively. This may make it hard to speak, read, or write. But apraxia isn't a problem with understanding language. It's when you have a hard time starting and completing the movements needed to speak. This happens even though you don't have weakness in the muscles you use to speak. Symptoms of Apraxia The main symptom of apraxia is being unable to make voluntary movements or gestures even though you have the physical ability and understanding to do so. The types of movement and the muscle groups that are affected depend on the part of your brain that’s involved. Depending on what type you have, symptoms may include issues with: Facial movements such as coughing or winking Precise movements using your finger , arm, or leg Using specific tools for specific tasks Moving your eyes Carrying out complicated tasks such as brushing your teeth or tying your shoe Mimicking movements with your head, arms, or legs Taking small steps Copying simple drawings Apraxia of speech can affect the way you speak in several different ways. Early signs of apraxia of speech in children may include: Very little babbling (in infants) Little variety in the sounds they make Omitting sounds within words, especially at the beginning of a word Being able to say a sound or word properly at certain times but not always Losing the ability to say a word they already learned Often using nonverbal forms of communication, such as nodding or pointing Childhood apraxia of speech often comes with other language or thinking and memory deficits, which may bring symptoms such as: Trouble chewing and swallowing Clumsiness If you have adult apraxia of speech, you may Speak slowly Say one word when you mean another, like “kitchen” instead of “chicken” Move your lips and tongue around a lot as you try to make certain sounds, a process called groping Have no trouble with words or phrases you often say, like “good morning” Lose the ability to make any sounds in serious cases What Causes Apraxia? Apraxia happens when certain parts of your brain aren’t working the way they should, particularly the parietal lobe. This can be caused by some diseases, but it usually results from brain damage to areas of the brain that contain memories of how to perform learned tasks. Apraxia can also be caused by damage to other brain areas. Conditions that can lead to apraxia include head trauma, stroke, dementia, and a brain tumor. Experts don't yet understand what causes childhood apraxia of speech. Some scientists believe it results from signaling problems between the brain and the muscles used for speaking. Ongoing research is focusing on whether brain abnormalities that cause apraxia of speech can be identified. Other research is looking for genetic causes of this type of apraxia. Some studies are trying to determine exactly which parts of the brain are linked to the condition. Apraxia Diagnosis Tests that may be used to diagnose apraxia include: Evaluation by a doctor: Your doctor will ask you to do familiar tasks that you’ve learned, such as brushing your teeth or cutting out a shape. An evaluation will also include a physical exam to see if your symptoms are due to problems with your muscles or joints. Your doctor may talk to your family members as well to find out how well you're able to do your normal daily activities. Brain function tests: Your doctor may use neuropsychologic tests to check how your brain is working in areas such as problem-solving, memory, language, attention, and processing. Imaging tests: If your doctor believes your apraxia is caused by damage to your brain, you may have imaging tests such as a CT scan or MRI to find the extent and location of the damage. Your doctor may look for other symptoms too. For instance, they may check for muscle weakness or difficulties with language comprehension. This helps them determine whether you might have another condition instead of apraxia. Diagnosing childhood apraxia of speech There's no single test or procedure that is used to diagnose childhood apraxia of speech. Diagnosis is complicated by the fact that speech-language pathologists have different opinions about which symptoms indicate the condition. Most experts, though, look for multiple, common symptoms. They may assess your child’s ability to repeat a word multiple times. Or they may see if your child can recite a list of words that are increasingly more difficult, such as “play, playful, playfully.” A speech-language pathologist may interact with your child to determine which sounds, syllables, and words they're able to make and understand. The pathologist will also examine your child's mouth, tongue, and face for any structural problems that might be causing symptoms. Usually, a diagnosis can't be made before your child's second birthday. Before this time, most kids are unable to understand or perform the tasks needed to determine whether they have apraxia. Apraxia Treatments There's no particular treatment for apraxia, and it can’t be cured. But it can be managed with physical, speech, and/or occupational therapy. These therapies can improve your symptoms and make apraxia easier to live with. If another condition is causing your apraxia, you'll get treatment for that condition. In some cases of acquired apraxia, the condition goes away on its own. But that's not the case with childhood apraxia of speech, which doesn't improve without speech-language therapy . Most children with apraxia of speech benefit from seeing a speech-language pathologist three to five times a week. Your child may also work with you to practice the skills they're developing. For the best results, the treatment should be designed to meet your child’s particular needs. Therapy for childhood apraxia of speech aims to improve speech coordination. Apraxia speech therapy activities may include: Repeatedly practicing forming and pronouncing sounds and words Practicing stringing together sounds to make speech Working with rhythms or melodies Using multisensory approaches, such as watching in a mirror while trying to form words or touching the face while talking If your child’s apraxia of speech is serious, they can also learn alternative ways to communicate, such as writing, drawing, or pointing. Another option is to use assistive electronic devices, including computers that can produce words and sentences. Many therapists believe sign language is helpful for children who have trouble being understood. They often recommend that children try to say the words they're signing, helping them practice making mouth movements. People with more serious cases of acquired apraxia may also benefit from sign language or computers. Very few studies have been done to determine how effective different treatments for childhood apraxia of speech are. This may be due, in part, to disagreement among experts about which symptoms should lead to a diagnosis of apraxia. Takeaways When you have apraxia, you have a hard time making certain movements. It happens when damage to your brain keeps it from giving the right instructions to your body. Different types of apraxia affect you in different ways. There's no cure, but physical, speech, and occupational therapy can improve your symptoms and make the condition easier to live with. Apraxia FAQs What’s the likely outcome for a person with apraxia? With therapy, some people get considerably better. Others may not see much progress or even get worse. It all depends on the person, how serious their apraxia is, and what's causing it. What’s the most common cause of apraxia of speech? Childhood apraxia of speech (CAS) may be caused by genetics or a brain injury from conditions such as childhood stroke, epilepsy, or infection. Unfortunately, the cause of CAS is unknown in most children. In adults, apraxia of speech is usually caused by brain damage. However, CAS can carry over into adulthood, as it is a chronic condition ."
46,Pain Management: Arachnoiditis,"The nerves of the brain and the spinal cord are protected by three surrounding membranes: the dura mater, arachnoid mater, and pia mater. Arachnoiditis is a pain disorder that develops when the arachnoid becomes inflamed. It is characterized by severe stinging, burning pain, and neurological problems. Symptoms of Arachnoiditis Symptoms of arachnoiditis can vary, but the most common is pain in the lower back or legs that is often described as burning or stinging pain. Others include: Weakness, numbness or tingling in the legs Pins and needles sensation (paresthesia) Joint pain Ringing in the ears (tinnitus) Fatigue Bladder problems As the disease progresses, symptoms may become more severe or even permanent. Many people with arachnoiditis are unable to work and suffer significant disability because they are in constant pain. Causes of Arachnoiditis Inflammation of the arachnoid can be triggered by a number of different irritants, including: Spinal cord injury: In most cases, it is related to complications from spinal surgery or procedure such as epidural injection and spinal tap. Infection: Viruses or bacteria such as bacterial meningitis of the spine can trigger the inflammation. Spinal nerve compression: Chronic degenerative disc disease or advanced spinal stenosis (narrowing of spinal column) can lead to compression of the spinal nerves, triggering inflammation of the arachnoid. Diagnosing Arachnoiditis Diagnosing arachnoiditis can be difficult, but tests such as the CAT scan (computerized axial tomography) or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) have helped with diagnosis. A test called an electromyogram (EMG) can assess the severity of the ongoing damage to affected nerve roots by using electrical impulses to check nerve function. Note: Myelograms with the radiographic contrast currently in use, combined with CAT scanning, are not considered to be responsible for causing arachnoiditis or causing it to worsen. Treating Arachnoiditis There is no cure for arachnoiditis. Treatment options for arachnoiditis are similar to those for other chronic pain conditions. Most treatments focus on relieving pain and improving symptoms that impair daily activities. Often, health care professionals recommend a program of pain management, physiotherapy, exercise, and psychotherapy . Surgery for arachnoiditis is controversial, because outcomes can be poor and provide only short-term relief. Clinical trials of steroid injections and electrical stimulation are needed to determine whether those treatments are effective."
47,Heart Disease and High Blood Pressure,"High blood pressure, also called hypertension , is a major risk factor for heart disease, kidney disease , stroke, and heart failure. What Blood Pressure Is Considered Too High? A blood pressure of 130/80 or higher is considered high. This is called hypertension A blood pressure between 120 and 129 and less than 80 is considered elevated. This means that you do not have hypertension , but you may develop it in the future unless you adopt lifestyle changes to keep your blood pressure under control. How Can I Prevent High Blood Pressure? You can prevent high blood pressure by: Maintaining a healthy weight; lose weight if you are overweight. Exercising more Eating foods low in salt Eating healthy foods like fruits and vegetables Drinking alcoholic beverages in moderation, if you drink at all These changes are also recommended for treating high blood pressure , although medicine is often added as part of the treatment. How Is Blood Pressure Related to Weight? As your body weight increases, your blood pressure can rise. In fact, being overweight can make you more likely to develop high blood pressure than if you are at your desirable weight. About 70% of adults in the United States are overweight. You can reduce your risk of high blood pressure by losing weight. Even small amounts of weight loss can make a big difference in helping to prevent and treat high blood pressure. How Can I Lose Weight? To lose weight, you need to eat fewer calories than you burn. But don't go on a crash diet to see how quickly you can lose those pounds. The healthiest and longest-lasting weight loss happens when you do it slowly, losing 1/2 to 1 pound a week. By cutting back by 500 calories/day, by eating less and being more physically active , you can lose about one pound in a week. Here are some tips to help you lose weight and get on the road to healthy eating : Choose foods high in fiber. Foods high in fiber include fruits, vegetables, dry peas, and beans, as well as whole-grain (as opposed to highly processed) cereals, pasta, rice, and breads. They are low-calorie and are good sources of vitamins and minerals. Choose whole-wheat vs. processed starches . Not all starches are equal. In general, you should choose whole-grain instead of processed starches. One guideline is to avoid starchy foods that are predominantly white in color - for example, white bread, potatoes, pasta, or rice. Whole-grain foods have higher nutritional value and generally leave you feeling fuller, which will also help prevent you from overeating. Limit serving size. To lose weight, it's not just the type of foods you eat that's important, but also the amount. To take in fewer calories, you need to limit your portion sizes . Try especially to take smaller helpings of high-calorie foods like higher-fat meats and cheeses. And try not to go back for seconds. Keep a food diary. Write down what you eat, when you eat and why. Note whether you snack on high-fat foods in front of the television, or if you skip breakfast and then eat a large lunch. Once you see your habits, you can set goals for yourself. Exercise . Another important ingredient to losing weight is increasing physical activity. Cutting down on calories and getting regular physical activity can help you lose more weight and keep it off longer than only eating less or only exercising. Exercise can also lower blood pressure. People who are physically active have a lower risk of getting high blood pressure than people who are not active. You don't have to be a marathon runner to benefit from physical activity. Even light activities, if done daily, can help lower your risk of heart disease . Take the stairs instead of the elevator, or park farther away from the entrance so that you have to walk farther. How Can I Reduce My Intake of Salt? Americans eat more salt and other forms of sodium than they need. Often, when people with high blood pressure cut back on salt, their blood pressure falls. Cutting back on salt also prevents blood pressure from rising. Some people, like African-Americans and the elderly, may be more affected by sodium than others. Since there's really no practical way to predict exactly who will be affected by sodium, it makes sense for everyone to limit intake of salt to help prevent high blood pressure. All Americans, especially people with high blood pressure, should eat less than 2,300 milligrams of sodium daily. That's about 1 teaspoon of table salt. But remember to keep track of ALL salt eaten -- including that in processed foods and salt added during cooking or at the table. You can teach your taste buds to enjoy less salty foods. Here are a few tips: Check food labels for the amount of salt in foods. Choose those lower in sodium most of the time. Look for products that say ""sodium free,"" ""very low sodium ,"" "" low sodium ,"" ""light in sodium,"" ""reduced or less sodium"" or ""unsalted,"" especially on cans, boxes, bottles, and bags. Buy foods that are fresh, plain frozen, or canned with ""no salt added. "" Use fresh poultry, fish and lean meat, rather than canned or processed types. Use herbs, spices, and salt-free seasoning blends in cooking instead of salt. Cook rice, pasta and hot cereals without salt. Cut back on instant or flavored rice, pasta, and cereal mixes, because they usually have added salt. Rinse canned foods like tuna to remove some sodium. A research study called the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) showed that you can reduce your blood pressure by eating foods rich in grains, fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products. How Much Alcohol Can I Drink if I Have High Blood Pressure? Drinking too much alcohol can raise your blood pressure. It may also lead to the development of high blood pressure. So to help prevent high blood pressure, if you drink alcohol, limit how much you drink to no more than two drinks a day if you are male. The ""Dietary Guidelines for Americans"" recommend that for overall health, women and lighter weight persons should limit their alcohol to no more than one drink a day. This is what counts as a drink: 1 1/2 ounces of 80-proof or 1 ounce of 100-proof whiskey 5 ounces of wine 12 ounces of beer (regular or light) You may have heard that some alcohol is good for your heart . Some studies suggest that people who consume a drink or two a day have lower blood pressure and live longer than those who consume excessive amounts of alcohol or no alcohol at all. Others note that wine raises the ""good"" (HDL) blood cholesterol that prevents the build-up of fats in the arteries . While these studies may be correct, they don't tell the whole story. Too much alcohol contributes to a host of other health problems, such as motor vehicle accidents, diseases of the liver and pancreas , damage to the brain and heart , an increased risk of many cancers, and fetal alcohol syndrome . Alcohol is also high in calories. So you should limit how much you drink. Can Caffeine Affect my Blood Pressure? The caffeine in drinks like coffee, tea, and sodas may cause blood pressure to go up, but only temporarily. In a short time your blood pressure will go back down. Unless you are sensitive to caffeine and your blood pressure does not go down, you do not have to limit caffeine to avoid developing high blood pressure. Can Stress Affect Blood Pressure? Yes. Stress can make blood pressure go up for a while and over time may contribute to the cause of high blood pressure. There are many steps you can take to reduce your stress. The article on easing stress will get you started. What About High Blood Pressure Drugs? If you have high blood pressure, the lifestyle changes mentioned above may not be enough to lower your pressure. Your doctor may recommend adding medication . Many people with hypertension need more than one drug to lower their blood pressure. The types of high blood pressure drugs include: Diuretics : They include amiloride ( Midamor ), bumetanide ( Bumex ), eplerenone ( Inspra ), furosimide ( Lasix ), chlorothiazide ( Diuril , Thalitone ), hydrochlorothiazide ( Esidrix , Microzide ), indaparmide ( Lozol) , methyclothiazide ( Enduron ), metolazone ( Zaroxolyn ), spironolactone ( Aldactone ), torsemide ( Demadex ), triamterene ( Dyrenium ) Beta-blockers : They include acebutolol ( Sectral ), atelinol ( Tenormin , Toprol) , bisoprolol ( Zebeta ), betaxolol ( Kerlone ), carvedilol ( Coreg ), labetalol ( Trandate ), nadolol ( Corgard ), metoprolol ( Lopressor ), penbutalol ( Levatol ), pindolol ( Visken ), propranolol ( Inderal , Innopran ), timolol ( Betimol ), ACE inhibitors : They include benazepril ( Lotensin ), captopril ( Capoten ), enalapril ( Vasotec ), fosinopril ( Monopril ), lisinopril ( Prinivil , Zestril ), moexioril ( Univasc ), perinopril ( Aceon ), quinapril ( Accupril ), ramipril ( Altace ), trandolapril ( Mavik ) Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers : They include candesartan ( Atacand ), epresartan ( Teveten ), irbesartan ( Avapro ), losartan ( Cozaar ), olmesartan ( Benicar ), valsartan ( Diovan ), telmisartan ( Micardis ) Calcium Channel Blockers : They include: amlodipine ( Norvasc ), diltiazem ( Cardizem , Tiazac) , felodipine ( Plendil ), isradipine ( Dynacirc ), nicardine ( Cardene ), nifedipine ( Adalat CC , Procardia ), nisoldipine ( Sular ), verapamil ( Calan , Covera , Isoptin , Verelan ), Alpha blockers: They include clonidine ( Catapres ), doxazosin ( Cardura ), guanfacine ( Tenex ), prazosin ( Minipress ), terazosin ( Hytrin ) Vasodilators : They include Hydralazine , Minoxidil . Many of these medicines are also available as combination pills that utilize 2 different drugs in one pill."
48,Meningioma,"A meningioma is a tumor that forms on membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord just inside the skull. Specifically, the tumor forms on the three layers of membranes that are called meninges. These tumors are often slow-growing. As many as 90% are benign (not cancerous). Most meningiomas occur in the brain . But they can also grow on parts of the spinal cord. Often, meningiomas cause no symptoms and require no immediate treatment. But the growth of benign meningiomas can cause serious problems. In some cases, such growth can be fatal. Meningiomas are the most common type of tumor that originates in the central nervous system. They occur more often in women than in men. Some meningiomas are classified as atypical. These are not considered either benign or malignant (cancerous). But they may become malignant. A small number of meningiomas are cancerous. They tend to grow quickly. They also can spread to other parts of the brain and beyond, often to the lungs . Causes and Risk Factors of Meningioma The causes of meningioma are not well understood. However, there are two known risk factors. Exposure to radiation Neurofibromatosis type 2, a genetic disorder Previous injury may also be a risk factor, but a recent study failed to confirm this. Meningiomas have been found in places where skull fractures have occurred. They've also been found in places where the surrounding membrane has been scarred. Some research suggests a link between meningiomas and the hormone progesterone . Middle-aged women are more than twice as likely as men to develop a meningioma. Most meningiomas occur between the ages of 30 and 70. They are very rare in children. Meningioma Symptoms Because most meningiomas grow very slowly, symptoms often develop gradually, if they develop at all. The most common symptoms include: Headaches Seizures Blurred vision Weakness in arms or legs Numbness Speech problems Diagnosis of Meningiomas Meningiomas are rarely diagnosed before they begin to cause symptoms. If symptoms indicate the possibility of a tumor, a doctor may order a brain scan: an MRI and/or a CT scan. These will allow the doctor to locate the meningioma and determine its size. A biopsy may sometimes be performed. A surgeon removes part or all of the tumor to determine whether it is benign or malignant. Meningioma Treatment If the tumor is not causing any symptoms, observation is often recommended. Regular brain scans will be performed to determine if the tumor is growing. If the tumor's growth threatens to cause problems or if symptoms begin to develop, surgery may be necessary. If surgery is required, a craniotomy will typically be performed. The procedure involves removing a piece of bone from the skull. This gives the surgeon access to the affected portion of the brain. The surgeon then removes the tumor -- or as much of it as possible. The bone that was removed at the start of the procedure is then replaced. The location of the meningioma will determine how accessible it is to the surgeon. If it can't be reached via surgery, radiation therapy may be used. Radiation can shrink the tumor or help prevent it from growing any larger. Radiation can also be used to kill cancer cells if the tumor is malignant. It may also be used on the parts of a tumor the surgeon was unable to remove."
49,What Is Chikungunya?,"Chikungunya is a virus that's spread by mosquitoes . You can't get it from another person, but mosquitoes do get it from biting a person who is infected. Most people don't die from it, but you could have some lasting pain. In fact, the name of the chikungunya virus in the African Makonde language means ""bent over in pain."" It's been seen in as many as 60 countries in Asia, Europe, Africa, and the Americas. The chikungunya virus isn't common in the U.S., compared to other countries. Cases of the virus were reported starting in 2014 among travelers returning to the U.S. from affected areas. Since then, rare cases of local transmission have been reported in Florida, Texas, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The chikungunya virus is spread by the yellow fever mosquito and the Asian tiger mosquito, which are in the Southeastern U.S., and parts of the Southwestern U.S. The Asian tiger mosquito is also found along the East Coast and in the lower Midwestern U.S. How Do I Know if I Have It? You may see signs of chikungunya around 3 to 7 days after you’re bitten. Chikungunya symptoms typically include fever and joint pain. You also might have a headache , nausea , red eyes, a rash , and be very tired. It can be hard to know for sure that you have chikungunya because it can look like other illnesses spread by mosquitoes , such as dengue fever or the Zika virus . See your doctor if you have these symptoms, especially if you  have been somewhere that’s recently had an outbreak or live in an area where it has been reported. How Is Chikungunya Diagnosed? The doctor will take a sample of your blood to check for signs that your body is fighting off the virus. There is a test in the U.S. that can check for chikungunya, the Zika virus, and dengue. After you're tested, your doctor will advise you on how to treat your symptoms. How Do You Treat Chikungunya? There’s no antiviral chikungunya treatment – or treatment that can kill the virus itself. There's no vaccine to prevent it, either. Doctors just treat symptoms. Acetaminophen will help with pain and fever, but you shouldn't take any of the following medicines until you rule out similar infections (like dengue): Aspirin Ibuprofen Naproxen sodium Drink plenty of liquids and get a lot of rest. If you have joint and muscle pain that won't go away, your doctor may give you steroids or medicines such as methotrexate that are used to treat conditions like rheumatoid arthritis. What's the Prognosis for Chikungunya? Most people don't die from the virus. In fact, you'll probably recover in a few weeks. Acute symptoms usually end after 7 to 10 days. There can be long-term effects from getting the chikungunya virus. Some people have lasting joint and/or muscle pain that can last for months – and in some cases, it lasts for years. That's called chronic chikungunya arthritis. About 40% of people who get the virus get arthritis from it. The virus is typically harder on newborns, people over 65, and people who have high blood pressure , diabetes , or heart disease . If you or someone you know has symptoms and is in one of these groups, call your doctor right away. If you get the chikungunya virus, you're likely to be protected from getting it again. How Can I Lower My Risk for Mosquito Bites? If you’re going to a place that has an outbreak, you can do some things to lower your chances of being bitten by mosquitoes: Wear long sleeves and long pants. Stay in screened-in areas, or indoors where there’s air conditioning. If you’re in a place with no air conditioning or screens in the windows, make sure there’s a mosquito net over your bed. If you go outside without sleeves, wear a mosquito repellent that has DEET. If you need to wear sunscreen , put that on first. Dump out any standing water in things like flower pots in your house or hotel room."
50,Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS),"What Is Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome? Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a condition that causes fluid to build up in your lungs so oxygen can’t get to your organs. Fluid leaks from small blood vessels and collects in tiny air sacs in your lungs so they can’t fill with enough air. Because of this, your blood can’t pick up the oxygen it needs to carry to the rest of your body. Organs such as your kidneys or brain might not work the way they should or might shut down. ARDS is sometimes life-threatening and can get worse quickly. But it’s generally treatable, and most people recover. Fast diagnosis and treatment are important. ARDS Causes and Risk Factors ARDS is usually triggered by another health problem, so most people who have it are already in the hospital for something else. Causes of ARDS include: Sepsis . This is when you get an infection in your bloodstream and your immune system goes into overdrive, causing inflammation , small blood clots , and bleeding. Accidents. Injuries from a car wreck or a fall can damage your lungs or the part of your brain that controls breathing . Breathing in harmful things. Dense smoke or chemical fumes can trigger ARDS. Other possible causes of ARDS include: Pneumonia Bleeding that makes you need a transfusion Inflamed pancreas Drug overdose Near- drowning Burns Reactions to medications Breathing food into your lungs ( aspiration ) Doctors don’t know why some people get ARDS and others don’t. Risk factors include: A problem in your genes Heavy alcohol use Smoking tobacco Using oxygen for a lung condition Recent high-risk surgery or chemotherapy Obesity ARDS Symptoms ARDS puts a lot of strain on your lungs. Symptoms include: Shortness of breath Low blood pressure Unusually fast breathing Fast heartbeat Cough Fever Chest pain , especially when breathing deeply Confusion and exhaustion Blue-tinted lips or nails from lack of oxygen in your blood Dizziness ARDS Diagnosis and Tests No single test can identify ARDS. It’s more of a puzzle that your doctor pieces together. They’ll want to rule out conditions that can have similar symptoms. Your doctor will ask about your medical history, do a physical exam , and listen to your breathing and your heartbeat. They may also look for: Signs of extra fluid in your body Bluish color on your lips or skin Tests to help with diagnosis include: Imaging tests. A chest X-ray is crucial and probably the first test your doctor will order. You might also have a CT scan . These can give your doctor an idea of how much fluid is in your lungs and where it is. Blood tests. These check your oxygen level. They can also look for signs of infection or anemia , a lack of red blood cells. Heart tests . These can rule out conditions such as heart failure (when your heart doesn’t pump blood through your body the way it should). ARDS Treatment Treatment aims to get the oxygen levels in your blood up to where they should be, so your organs get what they need. In some cases, your doctor might give you an air mask and later go to a breathing tube and ventilator (a machine that helps you breathe). Your doctor will also treat other conditions that might be causing ARDS. Treatments include: Nutrition and medicine through fluids injected into your blood Medication to prevent bleeding and blood clots Medication to keep you calm and comfortable Most ARDS treatment is done in a hospital’s intensive care unit. Many people have a full recovery with no long-term problems. ARDS Complications The condition or its treatment can lead to other problems, including: Collapse of part of your lung because it can’t inflate the way it should ( atelectasis ) or because of air between your lung and your chest wall (pneumothorax) Organ damage or failure Confusion High blood pressure in the artery that goes from your heart to your lungs ( pulmonary hypertension ) Scarred lung tissue (pulmonary fibrosis) Blood clots Infection ARDS Outlook If you’ve recently had ARDS, improve your recovery by: Not smoking Not drinking alcohol Getting a flu shot every year and a pneumonia vaccine as directed by your doctor You might need to be on a ventilator for a while. ARDS can leave you weak, so you may go to physical therapy to get stronger. ARDS can be emotionally and physically tough on patients and families. A support group may help with anxiety , stress , or depression ."
51,Rare Types of Anemia,"Think of your red blood cells as the transport system that carries oxygen to your body’s tissues. When you have anemia , your body doesn’t make enough red blood cells , or these cells don’t work as well as they should. You end up feeling weak, tired , and short of breath. Anemia comes in many forms. Iron-deficiency anemia is most common. Other types of the disease affect only small numbers of people. Here’s a look at some of the rare types of anemia and how they’re treated. Aplastic (or Hypoplastic) Anemia Blood cells are made from stem cells in your bone marrow. When you have aplastic anemia , stem cells in your bone marrow are damaged and can’t make enough new blood cells. You’re either born with aplastic anemia, meaning you inherited a gene from your parents that caused it, or you develop it (acquired). Acquired aplastic anemia is the more common of the two, and sometimes it’s only temporary. Acquired causes include: Autoimmune diseases such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis Chemicals such as pesticides, arsenic, and benzene Infections including hepatitis , Epstein-Barr virus, and HIV Radiation and chemotherapy treatments for cancer Inherited conditions such as Fanconi anemia, Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, and Diamond-Blackfan anemia, can damage cells and also cause aplastic anemia. Symptoms of aplastic anemia can include everything from shortness of breath and dizziness to headaches , pale skin , chest pain , fast heart rate ( tachycardia ), and cold hands and feet . One way to treat aplastic anemia is with a blood transfusion . You’ll get a donor’s blood through a vein. A stem cell transplant can also treat aplastic anemia. It replaces the damaged stem cells in your bone marrow with healthy cells. Sideroblastic Anemia In this group of blood disorders , your body can't use iron to make hemoglobin -- the protein that carries oxygen in your blood. The iron buildup causes the formation of abnormal red blood cells called sideroblasts. There are two main types of sideroblastic anemia: Acquired sideroblastic anemia can be caused by exposure to certain chemicals or drugs . Hereditary sideroblastic anemia happens when a gene mutation disrupts normal hemoglobin production. This gene produces “heme,” the part of hemoglobin that carries oxygen. Symptoms for both types include: Chest pain Fast heartbeat, or tachycardia Headaches Trouble breathing Weakness and fatigue Treatment for sideroblastic anemia depends on the cause. If you have acquired anemia, you'll need to avoid the chemical or drug that caused it. Other treatments include vitamin B6 therapy and bone marrow or stem cell transplants. Myelodysplastic Syndromes Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are diseases that are caused when your bone marrow is damaged and can't make enough healthy blood cells. MDS is a type of cancer . Some people are born with a gene that causes MDS. These genes are usually passed down from one or both parents. If you have certain inherited syndromes, including Fanconi anemia, Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, Diamond Blackfan anemia, familial platelet disorder, and severe congenital neutropenia , you could be more likely to develop MDS. A small number of people also get MDS after radiation or chemotherapy treatment for cancer . Another risk is exposure to chemicals like benzene, which is found in tobacco smoke. Some people don’t have symptoms with MDS, but others do, including: Bruising or bleeding Infection Fever Shortness of breath Weakness and fatigue Weight loss Oncologists (cancer doctors) and hematologists (blood doctors) treat MDS with chemotherapy, hematopoietic growth factors, and stem cell or bone marrow transplants . Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia Autoimmune hemolytic anemia happens when your body's immune system attacks and destroys red blood cells faster than it can make new ones. If you have an autoimmune disease like lupus , you’re also more likely to get this type of anemia. Medicines such as methyldopa ( Aldomet ), penicillin , and quinine ( Qualaquin ) can also cause autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Symptoms include fatigue, pale skin, fast heartbeat (tachycardia), trouble breathing, chills, backache, and yellow skin ( jaundice ). Treating the disease that caused the anemia can also stop your red blood cell damage. If you have an autoimmune disease, your doctor might treat you with steroid drugs to calm your immune system , which can help the anemia. Congenital Dyserythropoietic Anemia (CDA) CDA is a group of inherited anemias that reduce the number of healthy red blood cells in the body. All CDAs are passed down through families. There are three types of CDA, types 1, 2, and 3. Type 2 is the most common and type 3 is the rarest. Symptoms include chronic anemia, fatigue, yellow skin and eyes (jaundice), pale skin, and missing fingers and toes at birth. Some people never need treatment. But depending on the severity of the disease, your doctor might recommend a blood transfusion, a stem cell transplant, or medicines to lower iron levels or interferon alfa-2A, a drug typically used for treating leukemia and melanoma . Diamond-Blackfan Anemia If you have Diamond-Blackfan anemia, your bone marrow doesn't make enough red blood cells. Doctors think it is caused by changes to your genes. Symptoms of Diamond-Blackfan anemia include: Fast heartbeat (tachycardia) Fatigue Heart murmur Irritability Pale skin Short height Sleepiness Weak bones Treatments include everything from steroids that can help produce more red blood cells to red blood cell transfusions and bone marrow transplants. Megaloblastic Anemia With this type of anemia, your bone marrow produces abnormally structured red blood cells that are too large and too young. Because they’re not mature or healthy, they can't carry oxygen throughout your body very well. Megaloblastic anemia is caused by too little vitamin B12 (cobalamin) or vitamin B9 (folate). Your body needs these vitamins to make red blood cells. Some people with megaloblastic anemia might not have symptoms for many years. But once symptoms do appear, they’re similar to other types of anemia, and include: Dizziness and fatigue Diarrhea , nausea Fast or irregular heartbeat (tachycardia) Muscle pain or weakness Pale skin Trouble breathing Doctors treat megaloblastic anemia with vitamin B9 and vitamin B12 supplements to replace what your body is missing. You'll also need treatment for any disease -- such as Crohn's -- that caused your body to lack these vitamins. Fanconi Anemia Fanconi anemia makes your blood marrow produce too few blood cells. It's hereditary, meaning it’s passed down from one of your parents through a gene mutation. Symptoms and physical traits of Fanconi anemia include: Abnormal thumbs Easy bruising and bleeding Fatigue Frequent infections Heart , kidney , and bone problems Skin color changes Small body, head, and eyes If you have Fanconi anemia, you’re more likely to get a type of cancer called acute myeloid leukemia , or AML. Your odds of getting cancers of the head, neck, skin, GI tract, or genitals also go up. Treatment depends on several factors, including what stage it’s in and the severity of physical complications. Treatments include hormone therapy and growth factors to boost blood cell growth. If symptoms become severe, your doctor might recommend a bone marrow stem cell transplant. Oftentimes a bone marrow transplant can cure the problems altogether."
52,What Are Urea Cycle Disorders?,"Urea cycle disorders (UCDs) are a group of diseases. They make it hard for your child’s body to remove waste products as they digest proteins. They are inherited diseases -- you pass them down to your child. In most cases, you can manage them with diet and medications . When your baby eats protein , their body breaks it down into amino acids and uses what they need. What they don’t need is further broken down into waste products that their body removes. This happens in a process called the urea cycle. Your baby’s liver makes things called enzymes that turn waste nitrogen into urea. The urea leaves their body in their urine . If your child has a urea cycle disorder, their liver can’t make one of the enzymes the cycle needs. When their body can’t remove nitrogen, ammonia forms and collects in their blood . It’s toxic and can cause brain damage or put them in a coma . It can even be fatal if you don’t treat it quickly. Who Gets Them? UCDs affect about 1 in 35,000 newborns. There are eight types. They’re named after what’s missing from the urea cycle. You’ll also hear doctors call them by their initials: ARG1 deficiency -- Arginase ASL deficiency -- Argininosuccinate lyase ASS1 deficiency -- Argininosuccinate synthase 1 Citrin deficiency -- Citrin CPSI deficiency -- Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I NAGS deficiency -- N-acetylglutamate synthase ORNT1 deficiency -- Ornithine translocase OTC deficiency -- Ornithine transcarbamylase Parents pass these diseases down to their children through defective genes. We all inherit two copies of our genes, one from each parent. With most UCDs, you must get a defective gene from both parents to get the disease. The genes tell your child’s body how to break down protein. One UCD, called ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency, is what doctors call a sex-linked disorder. Mothers carry the gene on their X chromosome , and they mostly pass it to their sons. Symptoms UCDs fall into two groups: Complete UCD: This means your baby has a severe or total lack of the enzyme. You’ll notice symptoms in the first couple of days: Fussy Sleepy or sluggish Can’t feed Vomits Low body temperature Problems with posture Seizures Fast breathing that becomes slow Coma Partial UCD: Your baby can make some of the enzyme, but not as much as they need. You may not spot symptoms for months or even years. A buildup of ammonia (you may hear the doctor call it hyperammonemia) can happen from illness, injury, stress , or quick weight loss. Symptoms are usually less severe than in babies with complete UCD. They include: Avoiding foods high in protein or a dislike of meat Loss of appetite Nausea or vomiting Behavior problems, including hyperactivity Mental problems (confusion, delusions , hallucinations , psychosis ) Diagnosis Most newborns in the U.S. are tested for ASS1 and ASL, but how well the tests work is different in each state. Many states test for arginase and citrin deficiencies. A handful also test for OTC and CPS1 deficiencies. If your baby starts to show symptoms after you get home, the doctor will do a physical exam . They’ll ask about your family history and do tests. They’ll look for ammonia in your child’s blood and amino acid in their blood and urine. The doctor can take a tiny piece of their liver through a process called biopsy . They’ll test it for enzymes. Genetic tests will usually confirm the diagnosis. Treatment UCDs are life-threatening. Don’t wait to get treatment. A team of health professionals will care for your child. They will first do these three treatments at the same time: Dialysis to remove ammonia from their blood Feeding them supplements of sugars, fats, and amino acids Medicines to remove extra nitrogen Long-term treatment can manage UCD symptoms. Your child will need frequent blood tests throughout their life to check ammonia levels. Stresses on their body -- like illness, injury, or surgery -- can cause their levels to rise. During those times, you’ll need to give them extra calories so their body has plenty of fuel. Long-term treatment will include: A low protein, high-calorie diet Medications to remove nitrogen Supplements of amino acids Drinking plenty of water A liver transplant can reverse the symptoms of a urea cycle disorder. Outlook There’s no cure for UCDs. Your child’s long-term health depends on which UCD they have, how severe it is, how early it was diagnosed, and how closely you follow the treatment plan. If your child doesn’t follow the special diet or they have frequent stress -induced symptoms, repeated brain swelling can lead to irreversible brain damage. If they’re diagnosed early and follow their diet, they can live a normal life."
53,Chiari Malformation,"Chiari malformations are structural defects in the cerebellum. That's the part of the brain that controls balance. Some people with Chiari malformations may have no symptoms. Others may have symptoms such as: dizziness muscle weakness numbness vision problems headaches problems with balance and coordination Chiari malformations affect females more often than males. Scientists once believed that Chiari malformations occurred in only 1 in every 1,000 births. But the increased use of diagnostic imaging techniques such as CT scans and MRIs suggests that the condition may be much more common. Accurate estimates are difficult to make. That's because some children who are born with the condition either never develop symptoms or don't develop symptoms until they reach adolescence or adulthood. Causes of Chiari Malformations Chiari malformations are usually caused by structural defects in the brain and spinal cord. These defects develop during fetal development . Due to genetic mutations or a maternal diet that lacked certain nutrients, the indented bony space at the base of the skull is abnormally small. As a result, pressure is placed on the cerebellum. This blocks the flow of the cerebrospinal fluid. That's the fluid that surrounds and protects the brain and spinal cord. Most Chiari malformations occur during fetal development. Much less commonly, Chiari malformations can occur later in life. This can happen when an excessive amount of cerebrospinal fluid is drained away because of: injury infection exposure to toxic substances Types of Chiari Malformations There are four types of Chiari malformations: Type I. This is by far the most commonly observed type in children. In this type, the lower part of the cerebellum -- but not the brain stem -- extends into an opening at the base of the skull. The opening is called the foramen magnum. Normally, only the spinal cord passes through this opening. Type I is the only type of Chiari malformation that can be acquired. Type II. This is usually only seen in children born with spina bifida. Spina bifida is the incomplete development of the spinal cord and/or its protective covering. Type II is also known as ""classic"" Chiari malformation or Arnold-Chiari malformation. In type II Chiari malformation, both the cerebellum and the brain stem extend into the foramen magnum. Type III. This is the most serious form of Chiari malformation. It involves the protrusion or herniation of the cerebellum and brain stem through the foramen magnum and into the spinal cord. This usually causes severe neurological defects. Type III is a rare type. Type IV. This involves an incomplete or undeveloped cerebellum. It sometimes is associated with exposed parts of the skull and spinal cord. Type IV is a rare type. In addition to spina bifida, other conditions sometimes associated with Chiari malformations include: Hydrocephalus . An excessive buildup of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain. Syringomyelia . A disorder in which a cyst develops in the spinal cord's central canal. Tethered cord syndrome . A progressive disorder in which the spinal cord attaches itself to the bony spine. Spinal curvature. This includes conditions such as: scoliosis (a bending of the spine to the left or right) kyphosis (a forward bending of the spine ) Symptoms of Chiari Malformations Chiari malformation is associated with a wide range of symptoms which vary by type. Type I Chiari malformation usually causes no symptoms. Most people with the condition don't even know that they have it unless it is incidentally discovered during a diagnostic imaging test. But if the malformation is severe, type I may cause symptoms such as: Pain in the lower back of the head into the neck; it usually develops quickly and intensifies with any activity that increases pressure in the brain, such as coughing and sneezing . Dizziness and problems with balance and coordination Swallowing difficulties Sleep apnea Most children born with type II Chiari malformation have hydrocephalus. Older children with type II Chiari malformation may develop head pain associated with: coughing or sneezing bending over strenuous physical activities straining to have a bowel movement Some of the most common symptoms are linked to problems with the function of nerves in the brain stem. These include: weakness of vocal cords swallowing difficulties breathing irregularities serious changes in the function of nerves in the throat and tongue Treatment of Chiari Malformations If a Chiari malformation is suspected, a doctor will perform a physical exam . The doctor will also check functions controlled by the cerebellum and spinal cord. These functions include: balance touch reflexes sensation motor skills The doctor may order diagnostic tests, such as: X-ray CT scan MRI An MRI is the test most often used to diagnose Chiari malformations. If Chiari malformations cause no symptoms and do not interfere with activities of daily living, no treatment is necessary. In other cases, medications can be used to manage symptoms such as pain. Surgery is the only treatment that can correct functional defects or stop progression of damage to the central nervous system. In both type I and type II Chiari malformations, the goals of surgery are to: Relieve pressure on the brain and spinal cord Re-establish normal fluid circulation through and around the area In adults and children with Chiari malformations, several types of surgery can be performed. These include: Posterior fossa decompression surgery. This involves the removal of a small portion of the bottom of the skull and sometimes part of the spinal column to correct the irregular bony structure. The surgeon also may open and widen the dura. That's the firm covering of the brain and spinal cord tissues. This creates additional space for the cerebrospinal fluid to circulate. Electrocautery. This uses high-frequency electrical currents to shrink the lower part of the cerebellum. Spinal laminectomy . This is the removal of part of the arched, bony roof of the spinal canal. This increases the canal's size and reduces pressure on the spinal cord and nerve roots. Additional surgical procedures may be needed to correct conditions associated with Chiari malformations such as hydrocephalus. Surgery usually results in a significant reduction of symptoms and a prolonged period of remission. According to Children's Hospital in Boston, which specializes in the treatment of Chiari malformations, surgery virtually eliminates symptoms in 50% of pediatric cases. Surgery substantially reduces symptoms in another 45% of cases. Symptoms are stabilized in the remaining 5%."
54,What Is Aromatherapy?,"If you need improvement in health problems from anxiety to poor sleep , you may want to consider aromatherapy . In this kind of treatment, you use extracts from plants called essential oils, by either breathing them through your nose or putting them on your skin . Some people put the oils on their skin when they get a massage or take a bath. What Are Essential Oils? Essential oils are made from flower, herb, and tree parts, like bark, roots, peels, and petals. The cells that give a plant its fragrant smell are its ""essence."" When an essence is extracted from a plant, it becomes an essential oil. It takes a lot of plant product to make essential oils. More than 200 pounds of lavender flowers are used to make just 1 pound of lavender essential oil. Not all products made with plant essence are essential oils. True essential oils aren't blended with other chemicals or fragrances. They're made using a specific process that doesn't change the chemistry of the plant. Lemon, chamomile, lavender, cedarwood, and bergamot are a few of the essential oils used regularly in aromatherapy . How Aromatherapy Works Experts think aromatherapy activates areas in your nose called smell receptors, which send messages through your nervous system to your brain . The oils may activate certain areas of your brain , like your limbic system, which plays a role in your emotions. They could also have an impact on your hypothalamus, which may respond to the oil by creating feel-good brain chemicals like serotonin. Some experts think that when you put essential oils on your skin, they cause a response in your skin and other parts of your body, like your joints. What Is Aromatherapy Used For? You shouldn't use aromatherapy instead of your regular medical treatment. But for some conditions, research shows that aromatherapy can have health benefits. It may: Ease stress , anxiety , and depression Boost feelings of relaxation Improve sleep Help improve quality of life for people with long-term health problems like dementia Ease certain types of pain , including pain from kidney stones and osteoarthritis of the knee Fight bacteria when you put them on your skin Ease some of the side effects of cancer treatment , like nausea and pain Is It Safe? Aromatherapy is generally safe. Essential oils can cause side effects, though. Some can irritate your eyes , skin, or mucous membranes in your nose. They can also cause mild allergic reactions. If you drink some essential oils they can hurt your kidneys or liver . It's rare that people take essential oils by mouth , and you shouldn't do it unless your doctor says it's OK. If you're new to aromatherapy, work with an aromatherapist or your doctor. And keep in mind that essential oils aren't regulated by the FDA, which means that unlike drugs , the agency doesn't check to see if they're safe or work the way they're supposed to."
55,Living With Arrhythmia: Tips for Managing Your Heart Rhythm Disorder,"What Is an Arrhythmia? An arrhythmia (pronounced as “ uh-RITH-me-uh”) is an irregular heartbeat. This means your heart is out of its usual rhythm. About 1.5%-5% of people have arrhythmias. It may feel like your heart skipped a beat, added a beat, or is “fluttering.” It might feel like it’s beating too fast (which doctors call tachycardia) or too slow (called bradycardia). Or you might not notice anything. Arrhythmias can be an emergency, or they can be harmless. If you feel something unusual happening with your heartbeat, get medical help right away so doctors can find out why it's happening and what you need to do about it. Arrhythmia vs. dysrhythmia You may see or hear these two terms used interchangeably when people write and talk about the condition, but there's no difference between them. Both terms mean the same thing, referring to an abnormal or irregular heartbeat. What is a normal heart rate? There is a range of resting heart rates that is considered normal and healthy. For most adults, 60-100 beats per minute is normal, though some athletes can have rates as low as the 40s. On the other end, a normal maximum heart rate—or how fast your heart beats when it's working hardest—is typically 220 minus your age in years. The normal rhythm of your heart should sound or feel like a steady drum, a consistent “lup-dup.” If you have an irregular rhythm, it could feel like your heart is fluttering or racing. If you have symptoms of an arrhythmia, your doctor may refer you to an electrophysiologist to help determine its cause. (Photo credit: iStock/Getty Images) Arrhythmia Symptoms An arrhythmia can be silent, meaning you don't notice any symptoms. Your doctor may spot an uneven heartbeat during a physical exam . If you have symptoms, they may include: Palpitations (a feeling of skipped heartbeats, fluttering, or “flip-flops”) Pounding in your chest Dizziness or feeling lightheaded Fainting Shortness of breath Chest pain or tightness Weakness or fatigue (feeling very tired) Anxiety Blurry vision Sweating Rapid heartbeat Slow heartbeat Arrhythmia Causes You could have an arrhythmia even if your heart is healthy. The following could be irregular heartbeat causes: Heart disease The wrong balance of electrolytes (such as sodium or potassium) in your blood Heart injury or changes such as reduced blood flow or stiff heart tissue The healing process after heart surgery Infection or fever Certain medications, including antidepressants, decongestants, and high blood pressure medications Problems with electrical signals in your heart Strong emotions, stress, or surprise Things in your daily life such as alcohol, tobacco, caffeine, or exercise Diabetes High blood pressure COVID-19 infection Sleep apnea Problems with your thyroid gland Anxiety Cardiomyopathy Changes in hormone levels Types of Arrhythmias Arrhythmias are classified based on where they happen. If they start in the ventricles, the lower chambers of your heart, they’re called ventricular. When they begin in the atria, the upper chambers, they’re called supraventricular. Doctors also group them by how they affect your resting heart rate . Bradycardia is a slow heartbeat of fewer than 60 beats per minute. Tachycardia is a fast heartbeat of more than 100 beats per minute. Supraventricular arrhythmias Supraventricular arrhythmias include: Premature atrial contractions. These are early extra beats. They’re harmless and generally don't need treatment. Atrial fibrillation (AFib). The upper chambers of your heart contract in an unusual way. Your heart might beat more than 400 times a minute. Atrial flutter . This arrhythmia is usually more organized and regular than AFib. It happens most often in people who have heart disease and in the first week after heart surgery. It often changes to AFib. Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT). This is a rapid heart rate, usually with a regular rhythm. It begins and ends suddenly. Accessory pathway tachycardias. You can have a rapid heart rate because of an extra pathway between your heart's upper and lower chambers. Think of it as an extra road on your way home, in addition to your usual route. When that happens in your heart, it can cause a fast rhythm. AV nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT). This is caused by an extra pathway through a part of your heart called the AV node. It can cause heart palpitations, fainting, or heart failure. Ventricular arrhythmias Ventricular arrhythmias include: Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). These are among the most common arrhythmias. They're the “skipped heartbeat” that many of us feel sometimes. Ventricular tachycardia (V-tach). This is a rapid heart rhythm starting from your heart's lower chambers. Because your heart is beating too fast, it can't fill with enough blood. This can be a serious arrhythmia, especially in people who have heart disease, and it may be linked to other symptoms. Ventricular fibrillation (V-fib). This happens when your heart's lower chambers quiver and can't contract or pump blood to the rest of your body. It’s a medical emergency that must be treated with CPR and defibrillation as soon as possible. Long QT syndrome. Your heart’s lower chambers take too long to contract and release. This may cause dangerous rhythm problems and death. Bradyarrhythmias This type of arrhythmia refers to a slow heart rhythm, which can be caused by your heart's electrical system disorders or by certain medications. It may make you pass out or feel like you will. Types of bradyarrhythmia include: Sinus node dysfunction. This is caused by a problem with your sinus node, which is your heart's natural pacemaker. Heart block. This happens when there is a delay or block in the electrical impulses that travel from your heart's sinus node to its lower chambers. Arrhythmia Risk Factors Things that may make you more likely to have an arrhythmia include your: Age. The chances go up as you get older. Genes. Your odds might be higher if a close relative has had an arrhythmia. Some types of heart disease can also run in families. Lifestyle. Alcohol, tobacco, and recreational drugs can raise your risk. Medical conditions. High blood pressure, diabetes, low blood sugar, obesity, sleep apnea, anxiety, thyroid disorders, lung disease, and autoimmune disorders are among the conditions that may cause heart rhythm problems. Environment. Things in the world around you, like air pollution, can make an arrhythmia more likely. Heart disease. If you were born with a heart disease or have had other heart problems in the past, you're more at risk for arrhythmias. Previous treatments for heart disease. You're more likely to have arrhythmia if you've had surgeries or other treatments for heart disease in the past. Arrhythmia Diagnosis If you are experiencing irregular heartbeats, your doctor will start to examine the problem by performing a physical exam. They will take your pulse and listen to your heart. Then, to diagnose an arrhythmia or find its cause, doctors use tests and equipment, such as: EKG. An electrocardiogram (called an EKG or ECG) records the electrical activity of your heart. You wear small electrode patches on your chest, arms, and legs for the quick, painless test, which you take in your doctor's office. Holter monitor. This is a portable EKG (also called an “ambulatory electrocardiogram” or an ECG) about the size of a postcard or digital camera that you'll use for 1-2 days, or up to 2 weeks. The test measures the movement of electrical signals or waves through your heart. These signals tell your heart to contract (squeeze) and pump blood. You'll have electrodes taped to your skin. It's painless, although some people have mild skin irritation from the tape used to attach the electrodes to the chest. You can do everything but shower or bathe while wearing the electrodes. After the test period, you'll go back to see your doctor. They'll download the information. Event monitor . If your symptoms don't happen often, your doctor may suggest that you wear one of these, usually for about a month. When you push a button, it records and stores your heart's electrical activity for a few minutes. Try to get a reading when you notice symptoms. Your doctor will interpret the results. Implantable loop recorder. Your doctor puts this under your skin, where it constantly records your heart’s electrical activity. It can send information to your doctor’s office. Stress test . There are different kinds of stress tests. The goal is to check how much stress your heart can manage before having a rhythm problem or not getting enough blood. For the most common type of stress test, you'll walk on a treadmill or pedal a stationary bike while you get an EKG and have your heart rate and blood pressure monitored. Technicians slowly raise the intensity level of your exercise. Imaging tests. Your doctor may use CT scans or cardiac MRI to look for different physical signs that point to arrhythmia. These image tests can let them look at the structure of your heart chambers, see how well your heart is working, find scar tissue in the muscle, and check your arteries. Echocardiogram. This test uses ultrasound to check your heart muscle and valves. Cardiac catheterization. Your doctor will insert a long, thin tube, called a catheter, into a blood vessel in your arm or leg. They’ll guide it to your heart with help from a special X-ray machine. Then, they’ll inject dye through the catheter to help make X-ray videos of your heart valves, coronary arteries, and chambers. Electrophysiology study . This test records your heart's electrical activities and pathways. It can help find out what's causing heart rhythm problems and find the best treatment for you. During the test, your doctor will safely trigger your unusual heart rhythm. Then, they may give you medications to see which one controls it best or to see what procedure or device you need to treat it. Head-up tilt table test. Doctors use this test to find out what's causing fainting spells. It measures the difference in heart rate and blood pressure when you're standing up and lying down. You'll get this test in a lab. You'll lie on a stretcher, tilted at different angles while you get an EKG, and specialists check your blood pressure and oxygen level. This shows if symptoms of passing out are due to your electrical system, nervous system , or vascular system. Your doctor may refer you to an electrophysiologist, a cardiologist who specializes in treating heart rhythm disorders, to confirm an arrhythmia diagnosis. Arrhythmia Treatment Treatment will depend on what type of arrhythmia you have. Your doctor may recommend one or more of these. Medications Medicines that treat uneven heart rhythms include: Adenosine (Adenocard) Atropine (Atropen) Beta-blockers Calcium channel blockers Digoxin (Digitek, Digox, Lanoxin) Potassium channel blockers Sodium channel blockers Vagal maneuvers These techniques trigger your body to relax by affecting your vagus nerve, which helps control your heart rate. Your doctor might tell you to: Cough or gag Hold your breath and bear down (Valsalva maneuver) Lie down Put a cold, wet towel over your face Electrical cardioversion If drugs can't control an uneven heart rhythm (such as atrial fibrillation), you might need cardioversion. For this, you will be given a sedative to keep you asleep during the procedure. Then, your doctor will send an electrical shock to your chest wall to trigger your heart’s regular rhythm. Pacemaker This device sends small electrical impulses to your heart muscle to keep a safe heart rate. It includes a pulse generator (which houses the battery and a tiny computer) and wires that send impulses to the heart muscle. Implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) Doctors mainly use ICDs to treat ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, two life-threatening heart rhythms. The ICD constantly tracks your heart rhythm. When it detects a very fast, unusual rhythm, it delivers an electric shock to the heart muscle to make it beat in a regular rhythm again. The ICD has two parts: the leads and a pulse generator. The leads are made up of wires and sensors that monitor the heart rhythm and deliver energy used for pacing or defibrillation. The generator houses the battery and a tiny computer. Energy is stored in the battery until it is needed. The computer receives information from the leads to determine how the heart is beating. Your doctor programs the ICD to include one or all of the following functions: Anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP). A series of small electrical impulses to the heart muscle restores a regular rate and rhythm. Cardioversion . You may get a low-energy shock at the same time your heart beats to restore regular rhythm. Defibrillation. When your heartbeat is dangerously fast or uneven, your heart muscle gets a higher-energy shock to restore a regular rhythm. Anti-bradycardia pacing. Many ICDs give backup pacing to maintain the heart rhythm if it slows too much. There are different types of ICDs, including: Single-chamber ICD. A lead is attached to the right ventricle. If needed, energy is delivered to the ventricle to restore a normal heart rhythm. Dual-chamber ICD. Leads are attached to the right atrium and the right ventricle. Energy can be delivered to the right atrium and then to the right ventricle, which helps pace your heart in a normal sequence. Your doctor will determine which type of ICD is best for you. Before you have your ICD implanted, ask your doctor what medications you can take. Your doctor may ask you to stop taking certain medications before the procedure. You will receive specific instructions. After it’s implanted, you might not notice a low-energy shock. Or it may feel like a flutter in your chest. The high-energy shock lasts just a second, but it can hurt. Some people say it feels like being hit with a baseball bat or being kicked by a horse. Most people feel it more in their back than their chest. If you feel a shock, sit or lie down because you may pass out. Talk to your doctor about what to do if you ever get shocked. If you do get shocked, call your doctor immediately. Biventricular (B-V) pacemakers and defibrillators Also known as cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), these types of implantable devices help sync up your heart's contractions so that the left and right sides of the lower chambers pump together to deliver oxygen-rich blood to your body. The devices are made up of three wire leads and a pulse generator, which contains a battery and a tiny computer. When the pacemaker picks up on an abnormal rhythm, it sends electrical pulses through your heart's chambers to coordinate the contractions. The electrical signals are painless, and most people don't even feel the synchronization happening. Catheter ablation Think of this procedure as rewiring to fix an electrical problem in your heart. Your doctor will insert a catheter through your leg. It delivers high-frequency electrical energy to a small area inside your heart that causes the unusual rhythm. This energy “disconnects” the pathway of the unusual rhythm. Doctors use ablation to treat most PSVTs, atrial flutter, atrial fibrillation, and some atrial and ventricular tachycardias. Pulmonary vein isolation This type of catheter ablation treats arrhythmias by targeting your pulmonary veins, which bring oxygen-rich blood to your heart. These veins are where the abnormal electrical signals that cause irregular heart rhythm usually start. Pulmonary vein isolation uses very hot or cold temperatures to create scar tissue inside these veins, which will keep the faulty electrical signals from reaching your heart. This therapy can happen in two ways: Radiofrequency ablation. This more common choice uses heat from radio waves to destroy targeted tissue areas. Cryoablation. This method uses very cold temperatures to freeze and destroy specific tissue. Cardiac surgery There are a few surgical treatment options: Coronary bypass surgery. This surgery helps improve blood flow to your heart. This procedure creates a new pathway for blood to get to the heart when there's a clogged or partially blocked artery. A healthy blood vessel from the chest or leg is connected beneath the blocked artery to open up a new passageway. Mitral valve repair or replacement. This option either repairs problems with this particular valve, which is located between the left heart chambers, or replaces it with a mechanical valve or one made from cow, pig, or human heart tissue. The maze procedure. During this procedure, your surgeon makes a series, or “maze,” of cuts in your heart's upper chambers. The goal is to keep your heart's electrical impulses only on certain pathways. Some people need a pacemaker afterward. The maze procedure is often done in combination with coronary bypass surgery and mitral valve repair or replacement. Lifestyle and alternative treatments Alongside different medical treatments, your doctor may also suggest lifestyle changes and techniques to keep your heart healthy and help you manage arrhythmias. Change what you eat. Incorporate more heart-healthy foods such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains while limiting salt and solid fats. You may also want to limit caffeine because it can speed up your heart rate. Exercise often . Shoot for at least 30 minutes a day. This can help you keep a healthy weight and avoid obesity, which can raise your chances of heart disease. Drink moderately. Aim to cut back or stop drinking, as alcohol can raise your blood pressure. Moderate drinking for women of all ages and men older than 65 is up to one drink a day, and for men aged 65 and younger, it's up to two drinks a day. Control cholesterol and blood pressure . Change your habits and take any prescribed medications to keep your cholesterol levels and blood pressure in check. Quit smoking. Nicotine in tobacco can raise both your heart rate and blood pressure. Talk with your doctor about strategies to break the habit. Limit stress. Managing stress can also help lower the chances of irregular heart rate or keep it from happening altogether. Some stress-relief techniques for arrhythmia include yoga, meditation, breathing exercises, and acupuncture. Complications of Arrhythmias Without treatment, an uneven heart rhythm could cause dangerous problems, such as: Alzheimer’s disease and dementia. These cognitive disorders may happen because your brain doesn’t get enough blood over time. Heart failure . Your heart might not pump as well as it should after repeated arrhythmias. Stroke. Blood that lingers in your atria can clot. If a clot travels to your brain, it may cause a stroke . Cardiac arrest. V-fib could cause your heart to stop. Safe Driving Concerns If you have an arrhythmia, you could faint behind the wheel. This could put you, other motorists, pedestrians, and property at great risk. To figure out whether you can drive safely, your doctor will consider: What type of arrhythmia you have How serious your condition is The treatment you receive for it (if any) How often you have symptoms and how serious they are If you have no symptoms and you haven't had any serious heart rhythm problems, you should be able to drive as you always have. If meds keep your arrhythmia under control, your doctor may give you the green light to drive, too. In addition to meds to help manage your heart rhythm, you may have two other treatments. Both would keep you out of the driver's seat for a while: Ablation : This treatment will usually restrict you to the passenger's seat for about a week. It may keep you there longer, depending on your medical history. Implantable cardioverter defibrillator: Usually after you get an ICD, you'll be asked not to drive for a week. If you get an ICD after fainting or surviving cardiac arrest, you may have to wait several months before you get back behind the wheel. You can't drive commercially (as in a delivery truck or a taxi) at all if you have an ICD. Arrhythmia Prevention You can’t always prevent arrhythmias. Regular checkups with your doctor can help keep you from having more heart rhythm problems. Be sure they know all of the medications you’re taking. Some cold and cough medicines can trigger an arrhythmia, so talk to your doctor before using them. They may also recommend some lifestyle changes: Eat a healthy diet. Get plenty of fruits and vegetables, fish, and plant-based proteins. Avoid saturated and trans fats. Keep cholesterol and blood pressure under control. Don’t smoke. Keep a healthy weight. Exercise regularly. Manage stress. Limit alcohol and caffeine. Arrhythmia Takeaways If you notice irregular heartbeats or other arrhythmia symptoms, see your doctor right away. Some arrhythmias are more serious than others, and the condition can have many different causes. Be open and honest with your doctor about your lifestyle and other health conditions so that you can find the treatment that's right for you. Arrhythmia FAQs What are four symptoms of arrhythmia? At times, heart arrhythmias may be “silent” and not cause any symptoms at all. When they do, though, four common signs to look for include: Chest pain or discomfort Shortness of breath or trouble breathing Anxiety Dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting Is arrhythmia life-threatening? Irregular heart rhythms may be harmless, but there are types—such as ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation—that can be life-threatening. Arrhythmias can also damage your brain, weaken your heart, or hurt your other organs if they keep your heart from pumping enough blood to your body. This could lead to life-threatening conditions such as stroke, heart failure, or a heart attack. What are the bad symptoms of arrhythmia? While signs of arrhythmia can vary and can result from stress, caffeine, or other reasons, there are a few serious symptoms to watch out for in particular. You'll want to talk to your doctor, if you experience these often: Feeling faint Dizziness Shortness of breath"
56,What Is PIK3CA-Related Overgrowth Spectrum (PROS)?,"Vascular malformations caused by PROS are present at birth, but they may not show up until later in life. (Photo credit: Dermnet NZ) PIK3CA-related overgrowth spectrum (PROS) isn’t just one thing. It’s called a spectrum because it’s a group of rare syndromes. What they have in common is that they involve body parts that grow too much or have an unusual shape. This happens because of changes, or mutations, in a gene called PIK3CA. Those changes and the overgrowth they cause can happen in many parts of the body, including the skin, blood vessels, bones, fat, and brain. PROS can have a variety of symptoms, depending on which type it is and which parts of the body are affected. Often, these symptoms are visible when a baby is born, so doctors can diagnose a child with a PROS condition at birth. Sometimes it happens later in childhood. Understanding PIK3CA and PROS PROS-related vascular malformations can affect veins, arteries, and lymph vessels anywhere in the body. (Photo credit: Science Source) Changes in the PIK3CA gene cause PROS because of the gene’s regular job in your body. Like many genes, it has instructions for making a certain protein. The PIK3CA protein controls other proteins that act as important signals in your body. Those signals help to make sure that cells grow, divide, move, and die when they should. When cells don’t have the right PIK3CA instructions, the protein doesn’t do its job the right way. Faulty PIK3CA leads to mistakes in cell growth. When those mistakes cause cells to grow and divide too fast or live too long, it leads to overgrowth or unusual shapes in the parts of the body where it happens. In people with PROS, unusual growth can happen in some parts of the body but not others. That’s because the mutations that cause PROS usually aren’t in all of your cells, just some of them. Unlike many other genetic conditions, PROS isn’t passed on from parent to child. So if your child has it, it doesn’t mean that you have it or that your other children will. Types of PROS Sometimes, doctors diagnose PROS itself. Other times, they might give a diagnosis of one of the syndromes that fall under PROS, such as: Fibroadipose hyperplasia. This type causes patchy growths on limbs or other body parts. It happens when fatty or fibrous tissue or blood vessels grow too much. The growths tend to get worse over time and can cause problems with walking and movement. CLOVES syndrome. This condition’s name is an acronym that describes its symptoms. C stands for congenital, meaning it’s there at birth. L is for lipomatous, or related to fat. (Most infants with CLOVES have a visible fatty mass.) O is for overgrowth. V is for vascular malformations, or unusual blood vessels, which can cause things like birthmarks or prominent veins. E is for epidermal nevus, a kind of skin lesion. S is for spinal or skeletal problems, including a curved spine, called scoliosis. People with CLOVES can have other signs too, such as large hands, feet, fingers, or toes and wide spaces between their toes and fingers. Megalencephaly-capillary malformation (MCAP) syndrome. This form of PROS causes overgrowth of the brain and other body parts, such as blood vessels and parts of the face. People with MCAP syndrome may have a developmental delay and unusual fingers and toes. Hemihyperplasia-multiple lipomatosis (HHML) syndrome. This type often affects the growth of arms and legs. HHML syndrome causes slow-growing and painless fatty masses under the skin in many parts of the body. These often happen on the back, torso, legs, arms, and fingers. There may also be unusual blood vessels. Hemimegalencephaly. In this type, all or half of the brain is bigger than usual. There may also be changes in blood vessels. Children with hemimegalencephaly may have seizures, paralysis, and developmental delays. Facial infiltrating lipomatosis. This disorder includes painless swelling or overgrowth of part of the face. It often happens on only one side of the head. Sometimes, masses grow from nerves, or part of the tongue is bigger than usual. Bones and teeth also may be affected. Treatment There’s no cure for PROS, but there are ways to manage the condition and its symptoms. Your child’s doctor may recommend surgery to remove overgrowths, especially if they’re causing trouble with movement or other activities. Surgery might also relieve pressure on the brain, correct scoliosis, or manage other problems. Medications can help with seizures or other symptoms. What’s Ahead for My Child? PROS is a lifelong condition. The overgrowth of tissues may affect your child’s daily life in a number of ways. Since PROS is so variable and can affect different parts of the body, the outlook and symptoms can vary a lot from one person to the next. For example, when the brain is affected, it can lead to developmental delays and learning differences. Some people with PROS also may be more likely to get cancer. (Changes in the PIK3CA gene also show up in tumors of people with cancer who don’t have PROS.) Ask your doctor about your child’s risk now and in the future."
57,Arthritis and Takayasu's Arteritis,"What Is Arteritis? Arteritis is a general term that refers to the inflammation of arteries -- blood vessels that carry blood away from the heart and to the rest of the body. A closely related condition called vasculitis is inflammation of blood vessels in general -- including veins and arteries. What Is Takayasu's Arteritis? Takayasu's arteritis is an uncommon condition in which inflammation damages large and medium-sized arteries. The arteries most commonly affected are the branches of the aorta (the main blood vessel that leaves the heart), including the blood vessels that supply blood to the arms and travel through the neck to provide blood to the brain . The aorta itself is also often affected. Less commonly, arteries that provide blood to the heart, intestines , kidneys , and legs may be involved. Inflammation of large blood vessels may cause segments of the vessels to weaken and stretch, resulting in an aneurysm (bulging blood vessel). Vessels also can become narrowed or even completely blocked (called an occlusion). Takayasu's arteritis was named for Dr. Mikoto Takayasu, the doctor who first described the disorder in 1908. What Are the Symptoms of Takayasu's Arteritis? Approximately half of all people with Takayasu's arteritis will have a sense of generalized illness. This may include low grade fevers , swollen glands , anemia , dizziness , night sweats , muscle aches, and/or arthritis. The changes that occur in Takayasu's arteritis are often gradual, allowing alternate (collateral) routes of blood flow to develop. These alternate routes are typically smaller blood vessels. The collateral vessels may not be able to carry as much blood as the normal vessels. In general, however, the blood flow that occurs beyond an area of narrowing is almost always adequate to allow tissues to survive. In rare cases, if collateral blood vessels are not available in sufficient quantity, the tissue that is normally supplied with blood and oxygen by those vessels will die. Narrowing of blood vessels to the arms or legs may cause fatigue , pain, or aching due to reduced blood supply -- especially during activities such as shampooing the hair , exercising, or walking. It is much less common for decreased blood flow to cause a stroke or a heart attack . In some people, decreased blood flow to the intestines may lead to abdominal pain , especially after meals. Decreased blood flow to the kidneys may cause high blood pressure , but rarely causes kidney failure. Some people with Takayasu's arteritis may not have any symptoms. Their diagnosis may be discovered when their doctor attempts to take their blood pressure and has trouble getting a reading in one or both arms. Similarly, a doctor may notice that the strength of pulses in the wrists, neck, or groin may not be equal, or the pulse on one side may be absent. What Causes Takayasu's Arteritis? The exact cause of Takayasu's arteritis is unknown. Who Gets Takayasu's Arteritis? Takayasu's arteritis most often affects young Asian women, but it also can affect children and adults of all ages and ethnic backgrounds. At diagnosis, Takayasu's arteritis patients often are between the ages of 15 and 35. Every year in the U.S., two to three people are diagnosed with Takayasu's arteritis for every one million Americans. How Is Takayasu's Arteritis Diagnosed? The diagnosis of Takayasu's arteritis is based on a combination of factors, including: A complete medical history and careful physical exam to exclude other illnesses that may have similar symptoms Imaging studies (such as MRI, X-rays, and angiograms), which show location and severity of vessel damage Presence of a bruit. Significant narrowing of blood vessels may result in turbulent blood flow through the narrowed area that creates an unusual sound called a ""bruit."" Note: With most other forms of vasculitis, a biopsy (tissue sample) of the affected area confirms the presence of blood vessel inflammation. A biopsy is most appropriate when easily accessible areas, such as the skin , are affected. However, when large blood vessels are affected, a biopsy is often not practical because of the risks associated with surgery. How Is Takayasu's Arteritis Treated? Corticosteroids -- often called simply ""steroids"" -- are the most common treatment for Takayasu's arteritis. Steroids work within hours after the first dose is given. While this drug often is dramatically effective, it may be only partially effective for some people. Once it is apparent that the disease is under control, doctors slowly reduce the dosage of prednisone (a steroid) to sustain improvement, thereby trying to minimize treatment side effects. In some people, it is possible to gradually discontinue medication without a relapse. As the dosage of prednisone is gradually reduced, about half of all patients will have recurrent symptoms or progression of illness. This has led researchers to explore additional treatments to produce remission. Among medications that have been tried, with varying degrees of success, are immunosuppressive drugs such as methotrexate . When these drugs are added to prednisone to treat Takayasu's arteritis, 50% of patients who had previously relapsed will achieve remission and be able to gradually discontinue prednisone. Overall, about 25% of patients will have a disease that is not entirely controlled without continued use of these treatments. This emphasizes the need for continuing research to identify better and less toxic treatments for Takayasu's arteritis and other forms of vasculitis . Many patients with Takayasu's arteritis have high blood pressure. Careful control of blood pressure is very important. Inadequate treatment of high blood pressure may result in stroke , heart disease, or kidney failure. In some cases, it is desirable to stretch narrow vessel openings with a balloon (a technique known as "" angioplasty "") or to do a bypass operation to restore normal flow to the kidney. This may result in normal blood pressure without the need to use blood pressure drugs . Some patients may have serious disabilities because of narrowed blood vessels that supply other sites, such as the arms or legs. Bypass operations may correct these abnormalities. Aneurysms also can be surgically repaired. What Is the Outlook For People With Takayasu's Arteritis? In the U.S. and Japan, Takayasu's arteritis is fatal in only about 3% of patients who have had the disease for an average of five years. This encouraging statistic is the product of recognizing the disease and treating it appropriately. Reports from other parts of the world have been less optimistic, possibly because it is not as readily recognized and treated. Will People With Takayasu's Arteritis Be Able to Live Normal Lives? Approximately 25% of patients with Takayasu's arteritis seen at The Cleveland Clinic have an entirely normal lifestyle. Another 25% have had to make some adjustments in their activities. About half have had to modify their jobs and a small number of that group became occupationally disabled. Takayasu's arteritis is clearly a treatable disease and most patients improve. However, it is apparent that many patients have to deal with consequences of this illness that may be partially or, less often, completely disabling. Close follow-up is required as drugs used to treat the disease have side effects that should be regularly monitored by a doctor."
58,Polymyalgia Rheumatica and Temporal Arteritis,"Polymyalgia rheumatica is an infrequently occurring, inflammatory condition that causes pain or aching in the large muscle groups, especially around the shoulders and hips. Polymyalgia literally means ""many muscle pains."" Rheumatica means ""changing"" or ""in flux."" What Are the Symptoms of Polymyalgia Rheumatica? Symptoms of polymyalgia rheumatica tend to develop quickly and in addition to muscle pain , other symptoms may include: Stiffness around the shoulders and hips, especially in the morning and after resting Weakness Fatigue Generally feeling ill Mild fevers (occasionally) Weight loss What Is Temporal Arteritis? About 15% of people with polymyalgia rheumatica also have temporal arteritis and about half of people with temporal arteritis also have polymyalgia rheumatica. Temporal arteritis causes inflammation that damages large and medium-sized arteries . The name of the condition stems from the fact that some of the affected arteries provide blood to the head, including the temples. Temporal arteritis is also known as ""giant cell arteritis."" What Are the Symptoms of Temporal Arteritis? Temporal arteritis has several symptoms, including: Severe headaches, the most common symptom Scalp tenderness Jaw or facial soreness, especially with chewing Vision changes or distorted vision that's caused by decreased blood flow to the eye Stroke (rare) Fatigue Fever Weight loss Night sweats Depression Feeling ill Who Gets Polymyalgia Rheumatica and Temporal Arteritis? Polymyalgia rheumatica and temporal arteritis frequently affect people over age 50. The average age of patients is 70. These diseases are more common among women, and Caucasians are more likely to get these diseases than other ethnic groups. The exact cause of these illnesses is unknown. How Are Polymyalgia Rheumatica and Temporal Arteritis Diagnosed? Under the new criteria developed by the American College of Rheumatology and The European League Against Rheumatism, patients ages 50 years and older can be classified as having PMR if they meet the conditions below: Shoulder pain on both sides Morning stiffness that lasts at least 45 minutes High levels of inflammation measured by blood tests Reported new hip pain Absence of swelling in the small joints of the hands and feet, and absence of positive blood tests for rheumatoid arthritis The new classification criteria may also help to evaluate existing treatments for polymyalgia rheumatica. Everyone with polymyalgia rheumatica is typically tested for temporal arteritis. This, too, would start with the exam and listening to the patient's symptoms. If temporal arteritis is suspected, but less convincing features are present, a temporal artery biopsy may confirm the diagnosis. The biopsy is taken from a part of the artery located in the hairline, in front of the ear. In most cases the biopsy is helpful, but in some individuals it may be negative or normal, even though the person does have temporal arteritis. Can Other Problems Mimic Polymyalgia Rheumatica? Yes. Some other illnesses that may be confused with polymyalgia rheumatica include: Rheumatoid arthritis Infections Inflammation of blood vessels (vasculitis) Chemical and hormonal abnormalities A variety of muscle diseases Cancer How Are Polymyalgia Rheumatica and Temporal Arteritis Treated? There is no known cure for polymyalgia rheumatica and temporal arteritis, but these diseases can be treated and controlled. Corticosteroids -- often called "" steroids "" -- help rapidly relieve the symptoms of both conditions. Treatment with steroids -- usually in the form of prednisone -- is mandatory for temporal arteritis to prevent serious complications, such as blindness. Low doses of steroids are often successful in treating polymyalgia rheumatica. Higher doses are often required to treat temporal arteritis. Steroids reduce the function of inflammatory cells that cause these illnesses. Consequently, steroids minimize tissue damage. Steroids also impair the immune system -- thus increasing the risk of infection. The decision to prescribe steroids is always made on an individual basis. Your doctor will consider your age, presence of other illnesses, and medications you are taking. Your doctor also will make sure you understand the potential benefits and risks of steroids before you start taking them. You will have frequent blood tests while taking steroids or other medications to monitor for possible side effects and to evaluate the effectiveness of therapy. These blood tests can usually detect problems before you are aware of any symptoms. Your doctor will frequently evaluate your heart and lung function and blood sugar level, which may increase after you start taking steroids. While being treated for polymyalgia rheumatica or temporal arteritis, it is important to keep all appointments with your doctor and the lab, and have your blood pressure checked regularly. Because the medicines used to treat polymyalgia and temporal arteritis increase your chance for developing infections, report symptoms such as a cough , fever, or shortness of breath to your doctor. Long-term steroid treatment (for a few months to several years) requires additional testing and monitoring. The long-term use of steroids can cause osteoporosis ( bone loss ), which can be detected with scans similar to X-rays. Taking supplements of calcium and vitamin D , sometimes along with prescription medication is recommended to prevent osteoporosis in people taking steroids. Discuss the potential side effects caused by your treatment with your doctor. Temporal arteritis may also be treated with methotrexate or a biologic drug called tocilizumab (Actemra). Tocilizumab is given as an injection under the skin to decrease the amount of steroid a person needs. This medicine may be used along with steroids. Treatments work fairly quickly and have excellent results. What Is the Long-Term Outlook for Polymyalgia Rheumatica and Temporal Arteritis? With careful monitoring and appropriate treatment, most patients with polymyalgia rheumatica or temporal arteritis have a normal life span and lifestyle. Most of the time, these diseases can be successfully controlled with steroids and other drugs (including tocilizumab, a rheumatoid arthritis drug which has been touted for people who have trouble with or do not respond to steroids). The success of treatment is related to prompt diagnosis, aggressive treatment, and careful follow-up to prevent or minimize side effects from the medications."
59,Reactive Arthritis,"Reactive arthritis , formerly referred to as Reiter's syndrome, is a form of arthritis that affects the joints, eyes , urethra (the tube that carries urine from the bladder to the outside of the body), and skin . The disease is recognized by various symptoms in different organs of the body that may or may not appear at the same time. It may come on quickly and severely or more slowly, with sudden remissions or recurrences. Reactive arthritis primarily affects sexually active males between the ages of 20 and 40. Those with HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) are at a particularly high risk. What Causes Reactive Arthritis? The cause of reactive arthritis is still unknown, but research suggests the disease is caused, in part, by a genetic predisposition: Approximately 75% of those with the condition have a positive blood test for the genetic marker HLA-B27. In sexually active males, most cases of reactive arthritis follow infection with Chlamydia trachomatis or Ureaplasma urealyticum , both sexually transmitted diseases. In other cases, people develop the symptoms following an intestinal infection with shigella, salmonella , yersinia, or campylobacter bacteria. Besides using condoms during sexual activity, there is no known preventative measure for reactive arthritis . What Are the Symptoms of Reactive Arthritis? The first symptoms of reactive arthritis are painful urination and a discharge from the penis if there is inflammation of the urethra. Diarrhea may occur if the intestines are affected. This is then followed by arthritis four to 28 days later that usually affects the fingers, toes, ankles , hips, and knee joints. Typically, only one or a few of these joints may be affected at one time. Other symptoms include: Mouth ulcers Inflammation of the eye Keratoderma blennorrhagica (patches of scaly skin on the palms, soles, trunk, or scalp) Back pain from sacroiliac (SI) joint involvement Pain from inflammation of the ligaments and tendons at the sites of their insertion into the bone ( enthesitis ) How Is Reactive Arthritis Diagnosed? Diagnosis of reactive arthritis can be complicated by the fact that symptoms often occur several weeks apart. A doctor may diagnose reactive arthritis when the patient's arthritis occurs together with or shortly following inflammation of the eye and the urinary tract and lasts a month or longer. There is no specific test for diagnosing reactive arthritis, but the doctor may check the urethral discharge for sexually transmitted diseases . Stool samples may also be tested for signs of infection. Blood tests of reactive arthritis patients are typically positive for the HLA-B27 genetic marker, with an elevated white blood cell count and an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) -- both signs of inflammation. The patient may also be mildly anemic (having too few red blood cells in the bloodstream). X-rays of the joints outside the back do not usually reveal any abnormalities unless the patient has had recurrent episodes of the disease. On an X-ray, joints that have been repeatedly inflamed may show areas of bone loss , signs of osteoporosis , or bony spurs. Joints in the back and pelvis ( sacroiliac joints) may show abnormalities and damage from reactive arthritis. How Is Reactive Arthritis Treated? Bacterial infections , such as chlamydia, will need to be treated with antibiotics . Joint inflammation from reactive arthritis is usually treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) , such as naproxen , aspirin , or ibuprofen . Skin eruptions and eye inflammation can be treated with steroids . Those with chronic disease may be prescribed other medications , including methotrexate . Patients with chronic arthritis also may be referred to a physical therapist and may be advised to exercise regularly. What Is the Outlook For People With Reactive Arthritis? The prognosis for reactive arthritis varies. Most people recover in three to four months, but about half have recurrences for several years. Some people develop complications that may include inflammation of the heart muscle, inflammation with stiffening of the spine, glaucoma , progressive blindness, feet abnormalities, or accumulation of fluid in the lungs ."
60,Septic Arthritis,"Septic arthritis is also known as infectious arthritis , and is usually caused by bacteria. It can also be caused by a virus or fungus. The condition is an inflammation of a joint that's caused by infection. Typically, septic arthritis affects one large joint in the body, such as the knee or hip. Less frequently, septic arthritis can affect multiple joints. What Causes Septic Arthritis? Septic arthritis usually is caused by bacteria that spread through the blood stream from another area of the body. It can also be caused by a bacterial infection from an open wound or an opening from a surgical procedure, such as knee surgery. In adults and children, common bacteria that cause acute septic arthritis include staphylococcus and streptococcus. Among young, sexually active adults, neisseria gonorrhoeae is the most common pathogen for the condition. These foreign invaders enter the bloodstream and infect the joint, causing inflammation and pain. Other infections, such as those caused by viruses and fungi, can also cause arthritis. Viruses include: Hepatitis A, B, and C Parvovirus B19 HIV (AIDS virus) HTLV-1 Adenovirus Coxsackie viruses Mumps Alphaviruses Flaviviruses Fungi that can cause arthritis include histoplasma, coccidioides, and blastomyces. These infections are usually slower to develop than bacterial infections . Who's at Risk for Septic Arthritis? Young children and elderly adults are most likely to develop septic arthritis. People with open wounds are also at a higher risk for septic arthritis. In addition, people with a weakened immune system and those with pre-existing conditions such as cancer , diabetes, intravenous drug abuse, and immune deficiency disorders have a higher risk of septic arthritis. In addition, previously damaged joints have an increased likelihood of becoming infected. What Are the Symptoms of Septic Arthritis? Symptoms of septic arthritis usually come on rapidly with intense pain, joint swelling , and fever. Septic arthritis symptoms may include: Chills Fatigue and generalized weakness Fever Inability to move the limb with the infected joint Severe pain in the affected joint, especially with movement Swelling (increased fluid within the joint) Warmth (the joint is red and warm to touch because of increased blood flow) How Is Septic Arthritis Diagnosed? A procedure called arthrocentesis is commonly used to make an accurate diagnosis of septic arthritis. This procedure involves a surgical puncture of the joint to draw a sample of the joint fluid, known as synovial fluid. Normally, this fluid is sterile and acts as a lubricant. During arthrocentesis, a needle is inserted into the affected joint to collect fluid from the joint. The fluid sample is sent to a lab for evaluation. The lab will perform a white cell count on the fluid, which will usually be very high. The lab will also try to culture bacteria or other organisms. This will help the doctor determine if an infection is present and which organism is causing it. X-rays are typically done to look for joint damage . Blood tests can also be used to monitor inflammation. MRI scanning is sensitive in evaluating joint destruction but is less useful in the early stages. Blood tests can also be taken to detect and monitor inflammation. What's the Treatment for Septic Arthritis? Septic arthritis treatments include using a combination of powerful antibiotics as well as draining the infected synovial fluid from the joint. It's likely that antibiotics will be administered immediately to avoid the spread of the infection. Intravenous (IV) antibiotics are given, usually requiring admission to the hospital for initial treatment. The treatment, however, may be continued on an outpatient basis at home with the assistance of a home health nursing service. Initially, empiric antibiotics are chosen to cover a wide range of infections. If the bacteria can be identified, antibiotics specific to that organism are used. It may take four to six weeks of treatment with antibiotics to ensure complete eradication of the infectious agents. Is the Infected Fluid Drained? Drainage of the infected area is critical for rapid clearing of the infection. Drainage is performed by removing the fluid with a needle and syringe. Often the draining occurs daily or with multiple surgical procedures. The exact method depends on the location of the joint. Using arthroscopy , your doctor can irrigate the joint and remove the infected tissue. If drainage cannot be accomplished with joint aspirations or arthroscopy, open joint surgery is often necessary to drain the joint. If the fluid buildup is significant, the drains are left in place to remove excess fluid that may build up after the surgery."
61,What Is Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis?,"If a child, or a teen younger than 16, has joint inflammation and stiffness for more than 6 weeks, it may be juvenile idiopathic arthritis , formerly called juvenile idiopathic arthritis. The inflammation can cause redness, swelling, warmth, and soreness in the joints. But some children who have it might not complain about the joint pain . The condition can affect any joint, and it may limit how well that joint works. Most children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis recover fully. With the right treatment, they’re likely to do well and live a normal life. Causes Juvenile idiopathic arthritis is an autoimmune disorder . This means that the immune system attacks healthy cells and tissues. That causes the inflammation . Researchers don't know exactly why it happens. But they think it's a two-step process. First, something in a child’s genes makes them more likely to get it. Then something else, like a virus, triggers the arthritis itself. How Is It Different From Adult Rheumatoid Arthritis? Adults who have it usually have symptoms all their lives. But studies show that by adulthood, 70% of children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis outgrow it. They don’t have symptoms anymore. Symptoms Besides joint pain , it may cause chronic fever and anemia , which is a shortage of red blood cells . It can also affect the heart , lungs , eyes , and nervous system . Flare-ups, times when it gets worse, can last for several weeks. Later on, symptoms may lessen. They include: Fevers of 103 F or higher Pink rash that comes and goes Eye inflammation Joint pain or stiffness Limping Swelling in joints Being less active Trouble with movements of hands or fingers, affecting things like handwriting or coloring Problems with bone development and growth Different Types of Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis There are three kinds. Each type is based on the number of joints involved, the symptoms, and certain antibodies that may be in the blood . Four or fewer joints are involved. Doctors call this pauciarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis. It’s the most common form. About half of all children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis have this type. It usually affects large joints like the knees . Girls under age 8 are most likely to get it. Some children with this type have special proteins in the blood called antinuclear antibodies . They are more likely to get eye diseases like iritis , which is inflammation of the iris, or colored part of the eye . They can also get uveitis , which is inflammation of the inner eye . These children need regular eye exams by an ophthalmologist, a doctor who specializes in eye diseases. Lots of children with this condition will outgrow it by adulthood. Still, eye problems can continue, and joint symptoms may come back. Five or more joints are involved. You may hear this called polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis. About 30% of all children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis have this type. It usually affects the small joints, like those in the hands and feet, but it can sometimes involve the large joints. This type of juvenile idiopathic arthritis is usually symmetrical. That means it affects the same joints on both sides of the body. Some children who have this have an immune system chemical called rheumatoid factor in their blood . They often have a more severe form of the condition. It affects much of the body. Doctors may call this form “systemic.” Signs of this include joint swelling , fever, and a light pink rash . It may involve the heart , liver , spleen , and lymph nodes. A small percentage of children who have it develop arthritis in their joints. They may have severe arthritis that lasts into adulthood. Diagnosis Juvenile idiopathic arthritis is often hard to diagnose. Sometimes children who have it do not complain of pain. In fact, parents may not be aware of symptoms. Some symptoms are similar to other serious conditions like infections, cancer , bone disorders, Lyme disease , and lupus . If a doctor thinks a child may have juvenile idiopathic arthritis, they will ask about symptoms and the family’s medical history. They will give the child a physical exam to look for joint swelling, rashes , signs of internal organ inflammation, and eye problems . They may also take samples of the child’s blood and joint fluid, and use X-rays or other tests. Treatment Treatment usually includes medications along with exercise . The goals are to: Stop inflammation Ease pain and swelling Strengthen joints and help them move better Prevent joint damage and other complications Medications Medications for juvenile idiopathic arthritis include: NSAIDS (Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs) The medicines can curb pain, fever, and inflammation. They come as a liquid or a pill. People usually take them from one to 4 times a day. Some common NSAIDs are aspirin , ibuprofen , naproxen , and tolmetin . While NSAIDs ease pain and inflammation, they also have side effects. These include stomach pain , nausea , vomiting , headache , and anemia . Sometimes your doctor will give you another stomach -protecting medication to take with the NSAIDs. This will make stomach bleeding less likely. If you child does not respond well to NSAIDS, the doctor may prescribe a new drug called Xatmep. Xatmep is the first ready-to-use oral solution formulation of methotrexate to be approved for use in children with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis . An aggressive therapy, this medicine helps reduce further joint damage and helps preserve joint function. Side effects can include dizziness, fatigue, chills and fever. Meds That Stop the Condition From Getting Worse Your doctor may prescribe “DMARDs,” which stands for Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs. They also help with joint stiffness , pain, and swelling. Examples include hydroxychloroquine ( Plaquenil ), methotrexate , and sulfasalazine ( Azulfidine ). It may take about 3 to 6 months for these medicines to work. Because these are strong drugs, your child will need frequent tests to check for side effects. They can include anemia , low blood count, and kidney and liver problems. Other possible problems could be stomach aches, diarrhea , vomiting , nausea , headaches , rashes, loss of appetite, and weakness . “Biologic” Drugs for Your Immune System These drugs are genetically engineered to work on the immune system. They include adalimumab ( Humira ), adalimumab-atto (Amjevita), a biosimilar to Humira, anakinra ( Kineret ), etanercept ( Enbrel ), etanercept -szzs (Ereizi), a biosimilar to Enbrel, infliximab ( Remicade ), and infliximab-dyyb (Inflectra), a biosimilar to Remicade. If you take them, you are more likely to get an infection, including serious diseases like tuberculosis . Some biologics are only approved by the FDA for use in adults. Check with your doctor about which ones are appropriate for children. If You Need Corticosteroids These are strong, anti-inflammatory drugs. Doctors usually prescribe them only if other treatments don’t work, or if the condition is severe. This type of steroid isn’t the kind that bulks up your muscles. Corticosteroids come in pills or liquids, and are usually prescribed for short periods of time and in low dosages. Serious side effects can happen if they’re taken too long. These include stunted growth, ulcers, mood swings, weight gain, "" moon face ,"" muscle weakness, high blood pressure , osteoporosis , cataracts , and infections. Examples of steroids include dexamethasone, hydrocortisone , methylprednisolone , prednisolone , and prednisone . Exercise Exercise and physical activity are important for children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Movement brings less pain, builds strength, and keeps joints moving well. With the help of physical and occupational therapists, children learn simple ways to do everyday things. Therapists teach them exercises to improve their flexibility and strength. It can help to use hot and cold treatments . For instance, a warm compress can loosen up a stiff muscle and an ice pack often reduces swelling and inflammation. Therapists can also make splints for children to correctly position their joints and reduce pain. They can be used on knees , wrists, and fingers, as well as at night during sleep. If your child has juvenile idiopathic arthritis, encourage them to get out there and be active. Avoid contact sports and instead go for things that are not stressful on the joints, like swimming . Complications Eye problems are linked to some forms of juvenile idiopathic arthritis, so keep up with your child’s eye tests . The condition can also cause problems with oral health if it affects the jaw and makes it hard to brush and floss teeth . Dentists can recommend special toothbrushes and floss to help children take care of their mouths. Temporomandibular joint ( TMJ ) or jaw pain sometimes happens with juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Certain exercises can help with jaw pain and stiffness. If the lower jaw doesn’t develop correctly, it can cause an overbite . An orthodontist can usually fix this. In some cases, surgery may be needed. You may also want to check with your child’s doctor about their weight. Some children with the condition may need more calories. Others gain too much weight because they have problems being active, or because of side effects from medication. Extra weight is hard on the joints."
62,Psoriatic Arthritis,"What Is Psoriatic Arthritis? Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a form of inflammatory arthritis . It affects about 1 million people in the United States, or 30% of people who have psoriasis. Psoriasis is a skin disease that causes a red, scaly rash, most often on your elbows, knees, ankles , feet , and hands. Psoriatic arthritis is an autoimmune condition. It happens when your body’s immune system attacks healthy tissue by mistake. PsA most often affects your skin and your joints, which can become swollen, stiff, and painful. Over time, if you don’t treat it, the inflammation can damage joints and tissues. Psoriatic Arthritis Symptoms The symptoms of psoriatic arthritis include: Swollen fingers and toes Foot pain Lower back pain Fatigue Swelling and pain around tendons Stiffness and tiredness in the morning Less range of motion Nail changes Eye redness and pain Scaly skin, especially on your knees, elbows, and scalp Psoriatic arthritis shares some symptoms with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). But RA usually affects joints on both sides of your body. It can also cause bumps under your skin. Other skin and nail changes are more likely with psoriatic arthritis. Where can psoriatic arthritis affect your body? This condition can involve different body parts. Spondylitis affects your spine and may cause inflammation and stiffness in your neck, lower back, spinal vertebrae, or sacroiliac region (pelvic area), which can make it hard to move. Spondylitis also can attack connective tissue, like ligaments, or cause arthritis in the joints of your arms, hips, legs, or feet. Enthesitis is inflammation of entheses, the place where ligaments or tendons insert into your bones. You’re likely to get it on the bottoms of your feet, your Achilles tendons, and the places where ligaments attach to your ribs, spine , and pelvis. It affects only people with PsA, not other types of arthritis like rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis . Over time, enthesitis can make tissues in the affected area ropey (your doctor will call this fibrosis) or solid (the doctor might refer to this as ossification or calcification). Dactylitis, or “sausage digits,” is inflammation that affects an entire finger or toe. It happens when small joints and entheses of the surrounding tendons get inflamed. Dactylitis is another hallmark of psoriatic arthritis. It usually involves a few fingers or toes, but not in a symmetrical pattern. Unlike other types of arthritis, PsA can affect different toes and fingers on different sides of your body. Types of Psoriatic Arthritis Like other types of arthritis , psoriatic arthritis can be more or less severe. PsA may be: Oligoarticular. Usually a milder type that affects four or fewer joints Polyarticular. A more severe type that affects four or more joints Psoriatic Arthritis Causes Doctors aren’t sure what causes psoriatic arthritis, but these things may play a role: Genes. Having a parent with psoriasis triples your chance of getting psoriasis and makes you more likely to have psoriatic arthritis. Infection. An infection that sets off your immune system could be to blame. Psoriasis, for example, is often triggered by strep throat . Psoriatic Arthritis Risk Factors Psoriasis. Up to 30% of people with psoriasis get psoriatic arthritis. It affects men and women equally. Age. You can get PsA at any age, but it usually affects people between 30 and 50. Family history . As many as 40% of people with psoriatic arthritis have a family history of skin or joint disease. Psoriatic Arthritis Diagnosis Your doctor will ask about your symptoms and whether any of your relatives have psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, or another autoimmune disease. They’ll also check how well your joints move and whether you have pain, tenderness, swelling, or warmth. You may have tests including: Imaging tests such as X-rays, MRIs, CT scans, and ultrasounds Blood tests to rule out other kinds of arthritis and look for signs of inflammation Tests of the fluid from your joints or tiny samples of skin Psoriatic Arthritis Treatment Medical treatments for psoriatic arthritis include: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ). These are over-the-counter medications like ibuprofen and naproxen . Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). These can slow or stop pain , swelling, and joint and tissue damage. If NSAIDs don’t work, your doctor will try DMARDs. They may take longer to work. Immunosuppressants. If you can’t take a DMARD, you might get a type of drug called an immunosuppressant. These drugs curb your immune system, which is what’s causing the problem in an autoimmune condition like PsA. But they can also make it more likely that you’ll get an infection. UV light. Therapy with UVA light can ease skin symptoms in people who have severe psoriasis. But it may also raise your chances of skin cancer. Biologics. If immune suppression doesn't work, your doctor may prescribe a biologic. These are a newer type of DMARD. Rather than weaken your entire immune system, these medications block a protein that causes inflammation. Enzyme inhibitor. This works by blocking a certain enzyme, a kind of protein, called PDE-4. That helps slow other reactions that lead to inflammation. Steroids . These can help control inflammation, but doctors don’t use them often for PsA because they can make your skin rash worse. Doctors prescribe steroids only when you really need them. If you use them for a long time, you could have serious side effects such as brittle bones, weight gain , hypertension , and diabetes . Surgery. A severely damaged joint can be replaced with a new one made from metal and plastic. Lifestyle changes and home remedies Some things you do on your own can ease psoriatic arthritis symptoms: Keep a healthy weight. Carrying extra pounds puts more stress on your joints. It may also affect how well your medications work. Stop smoking. This is one of the best things you can do for your overall health. Limit alcohol. It can also affect how your treatments work. Exercise. It’s a great way to protect your joints and keep your weight in check. Stronger muscles can also support your joints. Low-impact exercises like swimming or walking are easier on them. Ask your doctor about an exercise plan. Try physical or occupational therapy. Your doctor might recommend that you see a specialist who can help you learn to manage your symptoms. This can involve exercises, body adjustments, hot and cold therapy, and tips for changing the way you do certain things. A physical or occupational therapist can also help you pick assistive devices like braces or splints to support your joints. Use acupuncture or massage therapy. These treatments are natural ways to ease pain and stiffness. Psoriatic Arthritis Complications PsA can make you more likely to have: A form of arthritis called gout Fatigue Obesity Metabolic syndrome, which may include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and high blood sugar Fibromyalgia Depression and anxiety Psoriatic Arthritis Flare Triggers Certain things could trigger psoriatic arthritis, including: Not taking your medication A skin injury, like a scrape or sunburn Infection Lack of sleep Stress Extra weight Psoriatic Arthritis Outlook There’s no cure for psoriatic arthritis. But treatment can ease your symptoms and may make them go away completely, known as remission. These periods can last for years."
63,"Hypnosis, Meditation, and Relaxation for Pain","Stress and pain often go hand in hand. Hypnosis, meditation , and relaxation may help break the cycle. If you’re thinking about trying these ways to work on your pain , you’ll want to know what to expect and how well they work. Hypnosis (Hypnotherapy) If you’re picturing a stage act led by a man with a swinging watch who gets volunteers to walk like a chicken or bark like a dog, forget that. Clinical hypnosis is a real therapy in which you learn how to use the power of your mind to help make positive changes. And you’re in control. During hypnosis, you’ll focus on relaxation and letting go of distracting thoughts. You may become more open to specific suggestions and goals, such as lowering pain. After your session, your therapist will go over the things that you can do to help you reach those goals. Research shows that medical hypnosis can help with both sudden (acute) and long-term (chronic) pain from cancer , burns , and rheumatoid arthritis . It may also ease the anxiety some people feel before surgery. When researchers at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York analyzed 18 studies, they found moderate to large pain-relieving effects from hypnosis, supporting its use for pain management. To find a licensed hypnotherapist, speak to your doctor or contact the American Society of Clinical Hypnosis. Meditation Meditation is like brain training . Anyone can do it -- anytime, anywhere. Studies suggest that making meditation a habit may help people manage their pain and self-esteem and lower their anxiety , depression , and stress . The details vary, depending on what type of meditation you choose to do, but it comes down to spending a few minutes (or longer) focusing your attention on one thing -- such as your breathing or a word or phrase that inspires or comforts you. As you meditate, other thoughts are bound to come up. That’s OK. Just direct your attention back to the thing you chose to focus on. Meditation is safe to try in addition to (not instead of) treatments that your doctor recommends. Relaxation Therapies These include techniques that aim to ease stress . In addition to meditation, the major types include: Progressive muscle relaxation. You slowly tense each muscle group, hold the tension briefly, and then let it go. You’ll do this in a systematic way -- for instance, starting with the muscles in your toes and working your way up your body. It helps you become aware of -- and release -- areas where you’re tense. If you have cardiovascular ( heart ) disease that’s not under good control, you should skip progressive muscle relaxation. Tensing your abdominal muscles can build up pressure in the chest cavity, slow your pulse, and hamper the flow of blood returning to the heart . Autogenic training. This technique uses visual imagery and body awareness to help you relax. The person imagines being in a peaceful place and then focuses on different physical sensations, such as heaviness of the limbs or a calm heartbeat. People may practice on their own, creating their own images, or be guided by a therapist. Breathing. It’s something you do every second of every day -- but often, we forget that it’s happening at all. You can practice tuning into your breathing as a form of meditation: in and out, in and out. You can also learn to do breathing exercises. For instance, you can breathe in slowly while you count to 4, hold your breath for 7 more counts, and then exhale for 8 counts. The best way to learn relaxation techniques is with the help of a trained practitioner. Usually, these techniques are taught in a group class and then practiced regularly at home. If you’ve had psychosis or epilepsy , you may want to speak with your doctor before trying meditation. There have been reports of some people having further acute episodes after deep and prolonged meditation. Hypnosis or deep relaxation can sometimes worsen psychological problems in people with posttraumatic stress disorder or who are vulnerable to false memories. You should check with your doctor first. Tai Chi and Qi Gong They’re both mind-body practices that have been around for centuries. You use postures, gentle movements, breathing techniques, and mental focus. Studies have found that they can help lower knee pain from osteoarthritis and help people with fibromyalgia and back pain . The evidence is less strong that tai chi and qi gong can help with long-term neck pain . Biofeedback This uses sensors attached to your body to help you practice relaxation. Specifically, biofeedback teaches you how to control involuntary responses, like your heartbeat or your blood pressure . Studies suggest that biofeedback may ease migraine and tension headaches . The evidence for other types of pain is less clear. Acupuncture This ancient medical technique stimulates certain points in your body, usually with thin needles put into the skin . Acupuncture has shown to benefit some people with specific types of pain. They include neck, low back, and knee pain from osteoarthritis . Acupuncture also may prevent migraines and cut down on how often you get tension headaches."
64,What Is Autoimmune Thyroiditis?,"Your thyroid is a small gland in front of your neck that makes hormones that help control just about every organ. When your thyroid hormone levels are too high or too low, your body can't work right. That can affect your energy level, mood, and weight. If your thyroid becomes inflamed, you have thyroiditis . Sometimes it happens because your body makes antibodies that attack your thyroid by mistake. This condition is called autoimmune thyroiditis, chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis, Hashimoto ’s thyroiditis, or Hashimoto’s disease. Causes Doctors don’t fully understand why your immune system misfires this way. It could be set off by a faulty gene, a virus, or something else. Or it could be a combination of causes. Could You Get It? You may be more likely to get autoimmune thyroiditis if you: Are a woman Are middle-aged Have another autoimmune disorder like lupus , type 1 diabetes , or rheumatoid arthritis Are related to someone who has autoimmune thyroiditis Have been exposed to environmental radiation Symptoms You may not have any in the beginning. As the disease goes on, your thyroid may become enlarged, a condition called a goiter. The front of your neck will look swollen, and it might make your throat feel full. The thyroid may or may not be tender to the touch. A damaged thyroid can’t do its job, which leads to hypothyroidism -- too little of the thyroid hormones. Symptoms can include: Tiredness Sensitivity to cold Puffy face Trouble pooping Enlarged tongue Pale, dry skin and brittle nails Hair loss Weight gain Muscle aches and joint pain Depression Memory lapse Heavy menstrual bleeding Diagnosis Your doctor will order blood tests to check your thyroid hormone levels. The tests also look for something called thyroperoxidase antibodies. You also might have an ultrasound so your doctor can look at your thyroid, especially if your blood test results aren’t clear. Your doctor might spot the problem through regular blood tests even if you don’t have any symptoms, especially if they’re aware that your family has a history of thyroid problems. Treatment The usual therapy is a prescription medicine called levothyroxine (Levo-T, Levothroid , Levoxyl , Synthroid , Tirosint, Unithroid ). It’s a man-made version of what a healthy thyroid makes. Your doctor will keep an eye on you and may have to adjust your dosage every once in a while. You’ll need to take medicine for the rest of your life. Some foods, like a high-fiber diet or soy products, can mess with levothyroxine. You should also let your doctor know if you take: Iron supplements A cholesterol medicine called cholestyramine ( Locholest , Prevalite , Questran ) Antacids that have aluminum hydroxide An ulcer medicine called sucralfate ( Carafate ) Calcium supplements"
65,Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease,"What Is Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease? Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) causes a lot of fluid-filled sacs, called cysts, to grow in your kidneys . The cysts keep your kidneys from working as they should. That can cause health problems like high blood pressure , infections, and kidney stones . It can also cause kidney failure, although that doesn't happen to everyone. You can have ADPKD and not know it for many years. It’s often called “adult PKD,” because the symptoms don't usually appear until people reach ages 30 to 40. Over time, ADPKD can start to damage your kidneys. You can slow the damage and prevent some of the complications by making healthy habits (especially those that help you lower and then maintain your blood pressure ) part of your life and taking medications as necessary. Depending on the type of ADPKD you have, you can lead an active life for many years by managing your symptoms and working with your doctor. There’s not a cure, but scientists are doing research to look for new treatments. ADPKD Symptoms Not everyone with ADPKD will have symptoms. Those who do may not notice anything for many years. Most people with the disease have high blood pressure . Urinary tract infections and kidney stones are also common. Other signs that you have ADPKD include: Pain in your back or sides, often because of a burst cyst, a kidney stone, or a urinary tract infection Blood in your pee Swelling in your belly as the cysts grow Over time, cysts may grow big enough to damage your kidneys and, for some people, can cause them to fail. If that happens, you may have: Fatigue The need to pee often Irregular periods Nausea Shortness of breath Swollen ankles , hands, and feet Erectile dysfunction ADPKD Causes ADPKD is caused by a problem with one of two genes in your DNA -- PKD1 or PKD2. These genes make proteins in kidney cells that let them know when to grow. A problem with either gene causes kidney cells to grow out of control and form cysts. Many genetic diseases happen when a person gets broken genes from both parents, but with ADPKD, you need only one faulty gene to have the disease. That's why this kind of PKD is called “autosomal dominant,” meaning only one parent has to pass on a broken gene. If one parent has the disease, each child has a 50-50 chance of getting it. You can get ADPKD even if neither of your parents had the disease. This happens when one of your PKD genes gets a defect on its own. But it’s rare for someone to get it this way. ADPKD Diagnosis If your doctor thinks there’s a problem with your kidneys, they may want you to see a nephrologist, a specialist who treats kidney diseases. They’ll ask you questions like: What kind of symptoms are you having? When did they start? How often do you feel that way? Do you know your blood pressure? Have you been having any pain? If so, where? Have you ever had kidney stones ? How often do you get them? Has anyone in your family been diagnosed with kidney disease ? Have you ever had a genetic test? The doctor will do some tests to get images of your kidneys and check them for cysts. They may start with an ultrasound , which uses sound waves to make a picture of the inside of your body. To look for cysts that are too small for an ultrasound to find, they could also use: MRI . It uses powerful magnets and radio waves to make pictures of organs and structures inside your body. CT scan . It's a powerful X-ray that makes detailed pictures inside your body. Doctors can also test your DNA to see if you have a broken PKD1 or PKD2 gene. But it’s important to know the limits of the test. It can show if you have the gene, but it can’t tell you when you’ll get ADPKD or how severe it will be. Questions to Ask Your Doctor About ADPKD How will this disease make me feel? Do I need any more tests? Do I need to see a specialist? What are my treatment options? Do the treatments have side effects? What do you expect for my case? What can I do to keep my kidneys working? If I have children, will they get the disease? Do my children need to get a genetic test? ADPKD Treatment and Home Care There is no cure for ADPKD, but you can treat the health problems that the disease causes and possibly prevent kidney failure. You may need: Medicine to prevent kidney failure. Tolvaptan (Jynarque) can slow the decline of kidney function for adults whose disease is at risk of quickly getting worse. Medicines to lower your blood pressure Antibiotics to treat urinary tract infections Pain medicines If your kidneys fail, you’ll need dialysis , which uses a machine to filter your blood and remove waste, like salt, extra water, and certain chemicals. You can also get on a waiting list or receive a kidney from a living donor for a kidney transplant. Ask your doctor if that’s a good option for you. It's important to stay as healthy as possible to protect your kidneys and keep them working as long as you can. Follow your doctor's advice carefully. You can also keep up these habits to stay well: Eat right. Stick to a healthy, well- balanced diet that's low in calories. Try to limit salt, because it can raise your blood pressure. Stay active. Exercise can help control your weight and blood pressure. Just avoid any contact sports where you might injure your kidneys. Don't smoke. If you smoke, get help from your doctor to quit. Smoking damages the blood vessels in the kidneys, and it may create more cysts. Drink plenty of water . Dehydration may cause you to have more cysts. ADPKD Outlook Cysts often grow very slowly. They can grow even slower when you control your blood pressure and make healthy lifestyle choices. But after many years, they can get large enough to damage your kidneys. As time goes on, some people have kidney failure and need dialysis or a kidney transplant. How quickly the disease gets worse may depend on which of your two PKD genes is broken. People with a defect in the PKD1 gene tend to get kidney failure before those with a problem in PKD2. ADPKD Complications ADPKD can also raise your risk for other health problems, such as: A bulge in a blood vessel of the brain , called an aneurysm Cysts on the liver and pancreas Diverticulosis Hernias Heart valve diseases such as mitral valve prolapse and aortic regurgitation High blood pressure Loss of kidney function Ongoing pain High blood pressure during pregnancy ( preeclampsia ) Colon problems Getting Support For more information on ADPKD, visit the website of the PKD Foundation ."
66,Avascular Necrosis (AVN or Osteonecrosis),"What Is Avascular Necrosis? Avascular necrosis (AVN) is the death of bone tissue due to a loss of blood supply.  You might also hear it called osteonecrosis, aseptic necrosis, or ischemic bone necrosis. If it isn’t treated, AVN can cause the bone to collapse. AVN most often affects your hip. Other possible sites are the shoulder , knees , and ankles . Symptoms of Avascular Necrosis In its earliest stages, AVN may have no symptoms, but as the disease progresses it typically becomes very painful. At first, it might only hurt when you put pressure on the affected bone. Then, pain may become constant. If the bone and surrounding joint collapse, you may have severe pain that makes you unable to use your joint. The time between the first symptoms and bone collapse can range from several months to more than a year. Causes and Risk Factors for Avascular Necrosis Things that can make avascular necrosis more likely include: Alcohol. Several drinks a day can cause fat deposits to form in your blood, which lower the blood supply to your bones. Bisphosphonates. These medications that boost bone density could lead to osteonecrosis of the jaw. This could be more likely if you’re taking them for multiple myeloma or metastatic breast cancer. Medical treatments. Radiation therapy for cancer can weaken bones. Other conditions linked to AVN include organ transplants, like kidney transplants. Steroid drugs. Long-term use of these inflammation -fighting drugs, either by mouth or in a vein, leads to 35% of all cases of nontraumatic AVN. Doctors don’t know why, but longtime use of medications like prednisone can lead to AVN. They think the meds can raise fat levels in your blood, which lowers blood flow. Trauma. Breaking or dislocating a hip can damage nearby blood vessels and cut the blood supply to your bones. AVN may affect 20% or more of people who dislocate a hip. Blood clots , inflammation , and damage to your arteries . All of these can block blood flow to your bones. Other conditions associated with nontraumatic AVN include: Decompression sickness, which causes gas bubbles in your blood Diabetes Gaucher disease , in which a fatty substance collects in the organs HIV Long-term use of drugs called bisphosphonates to treat cancers like multiple myeloma or breast cancer, which can lead to AVN of the jaw. Pancreatitis , inflammation of the pancreas Radiation therapy or chemotherapy Autoimmune diseases such as lup www.webmd.com/lupus/arthritis-lupus us Sickle cell disease Who Gets Avascular Necrosis? As many as 20,000 people develop AVN each year. Most are between ages 20 and 50. For healthy people, the risk of AVN is small. Most cases are the result of an underlying health problem or injury. Avascular Necrosis Diagnosis Your doctor will start with a physical exam. They’ll press on your joints to check for tender spots. They’ll move your joints through a series of positions to check your range of motion. You might get one of these imaging tests to look for what’s causing your pain: Bone scan. The doctor injects radioactive material into your vein. It travels to spots where bones are injured or healing and shows up on the image. MRI and CT scan. These give your doctor detailed images showing early changes in bone that might be a sign of AVN. X-rays. They’ll be normal for early stages of AVN but can show bone changes that appear later on. Avascular Necrosis Treatment Treatment goals for AVN are to improve the joint, stop the bone damage, and ease pain. The best treatment will depend on a number of things, like: Your age Stage of the disease Location and amount of bone damage Cause of AVN If you catch avascular necrosis early, treatment may involve taking medications to relieve pain or limiting the use of the affected area. If your hip, knee , or ankle is affected, you may need crutches to take weight off the damaged joint. Your doctor may also recommend range-of-motion exercises to help keep the joint mobile. Medications. If the doctor knows what’s causing your avascular necrosis, treatment will include efforts to manage it. This can include: Blood thinners. You’ll get these if your AVN is caused by blood clots. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). These will help with pain. Cholesterol drugs. They cut the amount of cholesterol and fat in your blood, which can help prevent the blockages that lead to AVN. Surgery. While these nonsurgical treatments may slow down the avascular necrosis, most people with the condition eventually need surgery. Surgical options include: Bone grafts . Removing healthy bone from one part of the body and using it to replace the damaged bone Osteotomy . Cutting the bone and changing its alignment to relieve stress on the bone or joint Total joint replacement . Removing the damaged joint and replacing it with a synthetic joint Core decompression . Removing part of the inside of the bone to relieve pressure and allow new blood vessels to form Vascularized bone graft. Using your own tissue to rebuild diseased or damaged hip joints. The surgeon first removes the bone with the poor blood supply from the hip, then replaces it with the blood-vessel-rich bone from another site, such as the fibula, the smaller bone in your lower leg. Electrical stimulation. An electrical current could jump-start new bone growth. Your doctor might use it during surgery or give you a special gadget for it. Caring for Avascular Necrosis at Home You can do these things to help: Rest. Stay off the joint. This can help slow damage. You might need to hold back on physical activity or use crutches for several months. Exercise. A physical therapist can show you the right moves to get range of motion back in your joint. Prevention To lower your risk of AVN: Cut back on alcohol. Heavy drinking is a leading risk factor for AVN. Keep your cholesterol in check. Small bits of fat are the most common thing blocking blood supply to you bones. Use steroids carefully. Your doctor should keep tabs on you while you’re taking these medications. Let them know if you’ve used them in the past. Taking them over and over again can worsen bone damage. Don't smoke. It boosts your AVN risk. Prognosis for Avascular Necrosis More than half the people with this condition need surgery within 3 years of diagnosis. If a bone collapse in one of your joints, you’re more likely to have it happen in another. Your outlook depends on several things: Disease stage at the time you were diagnosed If you have an underlying condition You’re less likely to do well if: You’re over 50. You’re at stage III or higher when you’re diagnosed. More than a third of the bone’s weight-bearing area is dead. The damage goes past the end of the bone. You have a long history of cortisone treatments."
67,Bird Flu FAQ,"What Is Bird Flu? Bird flu , or avian influenza , is a viral infection spread from bird to bird. The most common kind of bird flu is the H5N1 strain. It's mostly a threat to birds and doesn’t spread easily among people, but there was a major outbreak of bird flu in people in 2014. The very few cases of human-to-human transmission were among people with exceptionally close contact, such as a mother who caught the virus while caring for their sick infant . Migrating water fowl -- most notably wild ducks -- are the natural carriers of bird flu viruses. Scientists suspect that infection can spread from wild fowl to domestic poultry. What Are the Symptoms of Bird Flu? Bird flu symptoms in people can vary. The illness could start out with flu-like symptoms that include fever, cough, sore throat, and muscle aches. But it may worsen to include: Gut problems: Nausea, belly pain, diarrhea, and vomiting. Breathing problems: Shortness of breath, serious  respiratory distress or failure, pneumonia, and other respiratory diseases. Brain or nervous system changes: You might notice shifts in behavior, thinking, or even organ function. Seizures are possible in serious cases. In February 2005, researchers in Vietnam reported human cases of bird flu in which the virus infected the brains and digestive tracts of two children. Both died. These cases show that bird flu in humans may not always look like typical cases of flu. Scientists have identified more than a dozen different strains, or variants, of bird flu. H5N1, one of the deadliest strains for humans, has caused 456 bird flu deaths since 2003, according to the World Health Organization. How Do Humans Get Bird Flu? People catch bird flu by close contact with birds or bird droppings. In the 2014 outbreak, some people caught H5N1 from cleaning or plucking infected birds. There were reports in China of infection via inhalation of aerosolized materials in live bird markets. It's also possible that some people were infected after swimming or bathing in water contaminated with the droppings of infected birds. And some infections have occurred in people who handle fighting cocks. People don't catch the virus from eating fully cooked chicken or eggs . There were a few cases where one infected person caught the bird flu virus from another person, but only after close personal contact. In Indonesia in 2006, bird flu spread to eight members of one family. Seven of them died. It's not clear exactly how this happened. Family members likely had similar contacts with infected birds. They may also have shared genes that made them particularly susceptible to the virus. However, casual contact does not seem to be involved. Has Bird Flu Been Seen in the U.S.? Various strains of bird flu pop up in U.S. poultry from time to time. When they do, all affected poultry flocks are culled. For example, in 2004, a highly dangerous bird flu strain appeared in a Texas chicken flock. The outbreak involved an H5N2 virus (not the H5N1 bird flu). By April 2004, the outbreak had been eradicated. No human infections were detected. What Are the Types of Bird Flu? The bird flu virus, avian influenza A, is divided into two main categories: Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) causes more serious illness in chickens and is more likely to kill them. Low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) causes less serious illness in chickens and is less likely to cause death. Both versions can spread quickly through bird flocks and may cause serious illness in humans. This is important because birds infected with LPAI viruses may show little or no sign of disease as it spreads to animals or humans. Viruses often change over time, leading to different subtypes called strains. When bird flu infects humans, which is rare, it's most often from strains known as H5, H7, and H9. Less commonly, researchers have detected H10N8, H10N7, and H6N8 strains in humans. Is There a Bird Flu Vaccine? Yes, but you can't make an appointment to get it. The FDA approved the first vaccine to prevent human infection with one strain of the bird flu (H5N1) in 2007. But it’s not been made commercially available to the general public. The U.S. government purchased the vaccine in case it needed to be distributed by public health officials. Is There a Treatment for Bird Flu? The flu drugs oseltamivir ( Tamiflu ), peramivir (Rapivab), or zanamivir (Relenza) may help treat bird flu in people, although more studies are needed. These drugs must be given soon after symptoms appear."
68,What You Need to Know About Mercury in Fish and Shellfish,"Fish and shellfish are an important part of a healthy diet. Fish and shellfish contain high-quality protein and other essential nutrients, are low in saturated fat , and contain omega-3 fatty acids. A well-balanced diet that includes a variety of fish and shellfish can contribute to heart health and children's proper growth and development. Women and young children in particular should include fish or shellfish in their diets due to the many nutritional benefits. However, nearly all fish and shellfish contain traces of mercury. For most people, the risk from mercury by eating fish and shellfish is not a health concern. Yet some fish and shellfish contain higher levels of mercury that may harm an unborn baby or young child's developing nervous system. The risks from mercury in fish and shellfish depend on the amount of fish and shellfish eaten and the levels of mercury in the fish and shellfish. Therefore, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are advising young children and people who may become pregnant, are pregnant, or are nursing to avoid some types of fish and eat fish and shellfish that are lower in mercury. By following these three recommendations for selecting and eating fish or shellfish, women and young children will receive the benefits of eating fish and shellfish and be confident that they have reduced their exposure to the harmful effects of mercury. 1. Do not eat shark, swordfish, king mackerel, or tilefish because they contain high levels of mercury. 2. For people who are pregnant or breastfeeding: eat up to 12 ounces (2 average meals) a week of a variety of fish and shellfish that are lower in mercury. For children from 1 to 11 years old: Eat up to 8 ounces. Five of the most commonly eaten fish that are low in mercury are shrimp , canned light tuna, salmon, pollock, and catfish. Another commonly eaten fish, albacore (""white"") tuna, has more mercury than canned light tuna. When choosing your two meals of fish and shellfish, you may eat up to 4 ounces of albacore tuna per week if you are pregnant or breastfeeding. 3. Check local advisories about the safety of fish caught by family and friends in your local lakes, rivers, and coastal areas. If no advice is available, eat up to 6 ounces (one average meal) per week of fish you catch from local waters, but don't consume any other fish during that week. Follow these same recommendations when feeding fish and shellfish to your young child, but serve smaller portions. Frequently Asked Questions about Mercury in Fish and Shellfish What are mercury and methylmercury? Mercury occurs naturally in the environment and can also be released into the air through industrial pollution. Mercury falls from the air and can accumulate in streams and oceans and is turned into methylmercury in the water. It is this type of mercury that can be harmful to your unborn baby and young child. Fish absorb the methylmercury as they feed in these waters. It builds up more in some types of fish and shellfish than others, depending on what the fish eat, which is why the levels vary. I'm not pregnant, so why should I be concerned about methylmercury? If you regularly eat types of fish that are high in methylmercury, it can accumulate in your bloodstream over time. Methylmercury is removed from the body naturally, but it may take over a year for the levels to drop significantly. Thus, it may be present in a person even before they become pregnant. This is the reason why people who are trying to become pregnant should also avoid eating certain types of fish. Is there methylmercury in all fish and shellfish? Nearly all fish and shellfish contain traces of methylmercury. However, larger fish that have lived longer have the highest levels of methylmercury because they've had more time to accumulate it. These large fish (swordfish, shark, king mackerel, and tilefish) pose the greatest risk. Other types of fish and shellfish may be eaten in the amounts recommended by FDA and EPA. I don't see the fish I eat in the advisory. What should I do? If you want more information about the levels in the various types of fish you eat, see the FDA food safety web site or the EPA Fish Advisory website. What about fish sticks and fast food sandwiches? Fish sticks and ""fast-food"" sandwiches are commonly made from fish that are low in mercury. The advice about canned tuna is in the advisory, but what's the advice about tuna steaks? Because tuna steak generally contains higher levels of mercury than canned light tuna , when choosing your two meals of fish and shellfish, you may eat up to 6 ounces (one average meal) of tuna steak per week. What if I eat more than the recommended amount of fish and shellfish in a week? One week's consumption of fish does not change the level of methylmercury in the body much at all. If you eat a lot of fish one week, you can cut back for the next week or two. Just make sure you average the recommended amount per week. Where do I get information about the safety of fish caught recreationally by family or friends? Before you go fishing, check your Fishing Regulations Booklet for information about recreationally caught fish. You can also contact your local health department for information about local advisories. You need to check local advisories because some kinds of fish and shellfish caught in your local waters may have higher or much lower than average levels of mercury. This depends on the levels of mercury in the water in which the fish are caught. Those fish with much lower levels may be eaten more frequently and in larger amounts. Mercury Poisoning Symptoms Exposure to methylmercury in food could cause neurological and behavioral issues, such as the following: Anxiety Mood swings Memory issues Tremors Depression Numbness or feeling of pins and needles Loss of motor skills Trouble breathing Vision and speech impairment Muscle weakness Trouble with walking If exposed to high amounts of mercury from food or other sources, you could then develop severe or even fatal effects in your kidney, lungs, digestive tract, or cardiovascular system. Fish High in Mercury Swordfish has an average mercury load measuring 0.995 ppm and highest loads measuring 3.22 ppm. Shark has an average mercury measurement of 0.979 ppm, with higher measurements reaching 4.54 ppm. Tilefish from the Gulf of Mexico are very high in mercury, with average load measuring 1.123 ppm and a highest reading of 3.73 ppm. The Atlantic coast tilefish has lower averages of 0.144 ppm, but it can reach 0.533 ppm. King mackerel averages 0.73 ppm of mercury. This species can reach 1.67 ppm in some cases. Bigeye tuna can hold an average mercury load of 0.689 ppm and a high load of 1.816 ppm. Marlin has an average mercury reading of 0.485 ppm and higher readings of 0.92 ppm. Orange roughy has average loads measuring 0.571 ppm and highest measurements of 1.12 ppm. Chilean sea bass has average mercury loads of 0.354, but it can reach up to 2.18 ppm of mercury. Fish Low in Mercury Shrimp have an average mercury load of just 0.009 ppm, with higher measurements of 0.05 ppm. Canned salmon has an average mercury load of 0.014 ppm and can reach measurements up to 0.086 ppm. For fresh/frozen salmon, the average mercury load is 0.022 ppm with max concentrations of 0.19 ppm. Oysters have an average amount of just 0.012 ppm, with the highest measurement of 0.25 ppm. Scallops are one of the species with the lowest amount of mercury, with average amounts of 0.003 ppm and higher amounts at 0.033 ppm.

69,Multifocal Motor Neuropathy,"What Is Multifocal Motor Neuropathy? Multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) is a disease that affects your body's motor nerves. Those are the nerves that control your muscles. The condition makes it hard for them to send the electrical signals that move your body, which makes your hands and arms feel weak. They’ll also twitch and cramp . MMN is not life-threatening, and, in most cases, treatments can make the muscles stronger. The disease can get worse slowly, and after a while, you may have a hard time doing daily tasks, like typing or getting dressed. But for many people, symptoms may be so mild that they don't need treatment at all. You may be able to work and stay active for many years after your diagnosis. Most people are diagnosed with MMN in their 40s and 50s, although adults from ages 20 to 80 can find out they have the disease. Causes No one knows what causes MMN. Scientists do know it’s an autoimmune disease , meaning your immune system mistakenly attacks your nerve cells as if they were invaders. Researchers are studying the disease to try to find out why it happens. Symptoms If you have MMN, you’ll most likely notice the first symptoms in your hands and lower arms. Your muscles may feel weak and cramp up or twitch in a way you can’t control. It may start in specific parts of the arm or hand, like the wrist or finger. Usually the symptoms are more severe on one side of your body. The disease may eventually affect your legs. MMN isn’t painful, and you’ll still be able to feel with your hands and arms because your sensory nerves are not affected. But your symptoms will slowly get worse as you get older. Getting a Diagnosis Doctors often mistake MMN for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. They have similar symptoms, like twitching. Unlike ALS, though, MMN is treatable. Your doctor may tell you to see a neurologist, a specialist who treats problems with the nervous system. They will give you a physical exam and also ask questions about your symptoms, like: Which muscles are giving you trouble? Is it worse on one side of your body? How long have you been feeling this way? Do you have any numbness or tingling? Does anything make your symptoms better? What makes them worse? The doctor will do some nerve and blood tests to rule out other conditions that might cause your symptoms. They may do: A nerve conduction study (NCS). This test measures how fast electrical signals travel through your nerves. Usually, your doctor will put two sensors on the skin over one of your nerves: one to transmit a small electric shock and the other to record the activity. The doctor will repeat the test on other nerves if they think that more than one is involved. A needle electromyography (EMG). Your doctor will put electrodes on your arms. The electrodes have small needles, which go into your muscle, and they’re attached by wires to a machine that can measure the electrical activity in your muscles. Your doctor will ask you to slowly flex and relax your arms so the machine can record the activity. The doctor can do this test at the same time as the NCS. A blood test to look for GM1 antibodies, part of your body’s immune system. Some people with MMN have higher levels of them. If you do have a lot of these antibodies, chances are you have the disease. You might have MNN even if you don't have a lot of the antibodies, though. Questions for Your Doctor How will MMN affect me? Do I need treatment? What kinds are available? How will they make me feel? Will I be able to work? What happens if the treatment doesn't help? Are there any clinical trials I can join? Are there any activities I won't be able to do? Treatment If your symptoms are very mild, you may not need any treatment. If you do need treatment, your doctor will probably prescribe a medication called intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIg ). You’ll get the drug directly into one of your veins through an IV. You’ll usually get it in a doctor's office, although you can learn to do it at home. If IVIg works, you should feel your muscle strength improve within 3 to 6 weeks. The effects will wear off over time, though, so you’ll need to keep having the treatment. People usually have it once a month, but it may be more or less often depending on your condition. IVIg doesn't have many side effects, but it is expensive. Doctors are testing ways to give it directly through the skin like a regular shot, but this method isn’t available for everyone. If IVIg doesn't work, your doctor may try a drug called cyclophosphamide ( Cytoxan ), which is also used to treat certain types of cancer . This drug controls symptoms by turning down your immune system. Unlike immunoglobulin, cyclophosphamide can have bad side effects, so doctors try not to use it. Taking Care of Yourself If you get treatment for MMN early, you’re more likely to have few symptoms or long-term problems. Stick to your treatment plan, and talk to your doctor about any changes in how you’re feeling. If you have trouble with certain activities, you may want to see an occupational or physical therapist. They can help you keep your muscles strong and show you how to do daily tasks more easily if your muscles are bothering you. What to Expect Many people with MMN can continue most or at least some of their normal activities. The disease can get worse for some people and keep them from doing daily tasks. The kind of problems you have depend on which of your muscles are affected. If your hand muscles are weak, you may have trouble eating, typing, writing, or buttoning clothes. If your leg muscles are affected, you could have trouble walking. Some people with severe MMN have trouble in all these areas.

70,Ayurveda: Does It Really Work?,"Ayurveda (a Sanskrit word that means ""science of life"" or ""knowledge of life"") is one of the world's oldest whole-body healing systems. It was developed more than 5,000 years ago in India. Ayurveda is based on the belief that health and wellness depend on a delicate balance between the mind, body, spirit, and environment. The main goal of ayurvedic medicine is to promote good health and prevent, not fight, disease. But treatments may be geared toward specific health problems. Ayurveda is one of the oldest holistic healing systems in the world. It suggests that your health is based on the balance between your mind, body, spirit, and environment. (Photo Credit: iStock/Getty Images) Ayurveda and Your Life Energy Ayurveda is based on the theory that everything in the universe – dead or alive – is connected. If your mind, body, and spirit are in harmony with the universe, you have good health. When something disrupts this balance, you get sick. Among the things that can upset this balance are genetic or birth defects , injuries, climate and seasonal change, age, and your emotions. Those who practice ayurveda believe every person is made of five basic elements found in the universe: space, air, fire, water, and earth. These combine in the human body to form three life forces, or energies, called doshas. They control how your body works. They are vata dosha (space and air); pitta dosha (fire and water); and kapha dosha (water and earth). Everyone inherits a unique mix of the three doshas. But one is usually stronger than the others. Each one controls a different body function. It’s believed that your chances of getting sick – and the health issues you develop – are linked to the balance of your doshas. The Three Doshas in Ayurveda Vata dosha Those who practice ayurveda believe this is the most powerful of all three doshas. It controls very basic body functions, like how cells divide. It also controls your mind, breathing, blood flow, heart function, and ability to get rid of waste through your intestines . Things that can disrupt it include eating again too soon after a meal, fear, grief , and staying up too late. If vata is your dominant dosha, you may be smart, creative, vibrant, and your moods change quickly. Physically, you may be thin and lose weight easily, and are usually cold. When you are out of balance, you can get overstimulated and have anxiety , phobias, and be forgetful. You can also be more likely to have conditions like asthma , heart disease , skin problems , and rheumatoid arthritis . In ayurveda, like increases like. For this dosha (space and air), you can balance out too much vata by doing things that are grounding like meditation, massage, keeping a regular sleep and wake schedule, and eating warm, mild foods. Pitta dosha This energy controls your digestion, metabolism (how well you break down foods), and certain hormones that are linked to your appetite. Things that can disrupt pitta are eating sour or spicy foods, spending too much time in the sun, and missing meals. If you are pitta dominant, then you may be goal-oriented, competitive, confident, and a natural leader. Physically, you may have a medium-sized, muscular build and tend to be hot most of the time. When out of balance, you can be too competitive, cranky, quick to anger, and impulsive. If pitta is your main dosha, you’re thought to be more likely to have conditions like Crohn’s disease, heart disease , high blood pressure , indigestion, and fever when you are out of balance. To bring pitta (fire and water) back into balance, you can focus on things that are cooling and light, like salads, cucumbers, and practicing moderation and slow or restorative yoga. Kapha dosha Kapha dosha is thought to control muscle growth, body strength and stability, weight , and your immune system. Things that can disrupt kapha include daytime naps, eating too many sweet foods, and eating or drinking things that contain too much salt or water. If kapha is your main dosha, you may like routine, stick to expectations, and be accepting, calm, and patient. Physically, you are more likely to have a broad frame and easily gain weight. When out of balance, you can easily get fatigued, avoid taking on new projects, and be possessive, stubborn, and depressed. If you are kapha dominant, you may be more likely to develop asthma and other breathing disorders, cancer , diabetes , nausea after eating, and obesity . To reduce excess kapha (earth and water) and be more balanced, you can increase the amount of fruits and vegetables in your diet, and do exercise that gets the blood flowing like jogging or sun salutations in yoga. Ayurvedic Treatment An ayurvedic practitioner will create a treatment plan specifically designed for you. They’ll take into account your unique physical and emotional makeup, and your primary and secondary doshas. They will use that information to work toward the goal of treatment, which is to bring your mind and body into balance. There are several tools used in ayurvedic medicine to help you create harmony, avoid disease, and treat conditions you may have. These include: Herbal medicine. A key component of ayurveda, it's used in different combinations, depending on your dosha, and includes licorice, red clover, ginger, and turmeric. Yoga Meditation Purification programs. Also known as panchakarma, these are used to cleanse your body of undigested food through practices like blood purification, massage , medical oils, herbs, enemas, and laxatives. Counseling. Your practitioner will help you understand your dosha, how it impacts your life, and how you can change your lifestyle to create more balance and harmony. Other treatments used in ayurveda include oil massage, breathing exercises (known as pranayama), and repeating mantras, or phrases. Benefits of Ayurveda As with many alternative therapies, not as much clinical research has been done on ayurveda as on Western medicine. But many practices of ayurveda have been shown to improve health and well-being. If you have conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, ayurveda treatments may improve symptoms. Ayurveda has also been shown to lower blood pressure and cholesterol. An ayurvedic diet focuses on an increase in eating fruits, vegetables, and whole grains and decreasing meat intake, particularly red meat. This could reduce the risk of heart disease. Practicing yoga can reduce chronic pain and anxiety and improve circulation and digestion. Fenugreek has been shown to lower bad cholesterol (LDL) and increase good cholesterol (HDL). Meditation may reduce anxiety, increase focus, help you better manage stress, and improve the quality of your sleep. It may also help you manage symptoms of conditions like chronic pain, cancer, depression, and irritable bowel syndrome. It is important to note that the FDA doesn’t review or approve ayurvedic products. In fact, it has banned certain ones from entering the country since 2007. What’s more, the FDA has warned that 1 in 5 ayurvedic medicines contain toxic metals, like lead, mercury, and arsenic. These heavy metals can cause life-threatening illnesses, especially in children. Always talk to your doctor before you try ayurveda or any other alternative medical treatment. Finding an Ayurveda Practitioner There is no exact data on the number of people who use ayurvedic medicine, but an estimated 80% of people in India are thought to use at least some ayurvedic treatments. In India, ayurveda is considered a traditional medical system, and some practitioners can perform surgery. In the U.S., it’s considered a form of complementary and alternative medicine . If you’d like to try ayurvedic medicine, talk with an integrative medicine specialist or functional medicine doctor to make sure any herbal medicines you want to take have been tested for contaminants and approved by an independent laboratory. These doctors can also help integrate Western medicine and ayurveda. There are a few state-approved ayurvedic schools in the U.S. But there’s no national standard training or certification program for those who practice ayurveda. You can find a practitioner near you at the National Ayurvedic Medical Association. Ayurvedic Lifestyle If you have only used Western medicine, ayurveda may sound exotic. If you’re not ready to visit an ayurvedic practitioner for a consultation, there are many simple ayurvedic practices you can do at home to help balance your mental, physical, and spiritual health. For sleep/stress relief Try keeping a regular sleep/wake schedule and adopting better sleep hygiene. (Keep your bedroom quiet, at a comfortable temperature, and dark at bedtime. Keep laptops and phones out of the bedroom at night.) Set aside time (daily, if possible) for meditation. Practice deep breathing techniques like box breathing – breathe in for four counts, hold your breath for four counts, breathe out for four counts and hold again for four. Repeat this three or four times. Exercise Try a yoga class. You can go to a local studio, take online classes, or find free ones on YouTube. Increase the amount you move during the day. Listen to your body – maybe you need a long, slow walk one day and a brisk run another. Ayurvedic food Eat fresh, homemade food instead of processed products. Enjoy your food and eat when you are calm, instead of stressed or angry, for good digestion. Eat your biggest meal at lunch when your digestion is best. This may also help you sleep at night if you aren't trying to digest a heavy dinner. Focus on foods that balance all of the doshas, including fruits, vegetables, rice, nuts, and honey as a sweetener. Herbs You can incorporate many herbs used in ayurveda when cooking food. Before taking herbal supplements, check with your doctor to make sure they are safe and won't interact with any medications you are taking. Some of the most commonly used, and easy-to-access, herbs in ayurveda include: Ashwagandha , which reduces stress and helps with sleep Turmeric , an anti-inflammatory Ginger , a root that can reduce nausea Cumin , a spice that helps with digestion Black pepper , which can be a decongestant Takeaways Ayurveda is a complex system that takes into account nearly all parts of your physical, spiritual, and mental health. But there are easy practices you can do at home as well. If you want to find out which dosha is your dominant one, The Ayurvedic Institute has a dosha quiz.
