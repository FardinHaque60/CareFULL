0,"H. pylori Infection: Symptoms, Causes, Diagnosis, and Treatment","What Is H. pylori? H. pylori is a type of bacteria that infects your stomach and can cause issues like ulcers. (Photo credit: Thinkstock / Getty Images) Helicobacter pylori ( H. pylori ) is a type of bacteria that infects your stomach. It can cause sores and inflammation in the lining of your stomach or the upper part of your small intestine (the duodenum). For some people, an infection can lead to stomach cancer . Infection with H. pylori is common. About two-thirds of the world’s population has it in their bodies. For most people, it never causes any symptoms. But it's the most common cause of peptic ulcers, which are painful open sores in your digestive tract. In rare cases, it could even lead to stomach cancer. How Do You Get H. pylori? H. pylori bacteria usually spread from person to person and also likely through: Dirty food, water, or utensils Mouth to mouth (kissing) Contaminated poop or vomit Once H. pylori enters your body, it multiplies in the lining of your stomach. This weakens the lining, making it more likely that your stomach acids will cause an ulcer. Is H. pylori contagious? Yes. You can get H. pylori if you have contact with the saliva or other body fluids of someone who is already infected. H. pylori Risk Factors Most people get H. pylori during childhood, but adults can get it, too. Infections are often related to your living conditions. Risk factors include: Crowded living conditions Lack of clean water and sewer service Living in close quarters with someone who is infected Living in a developing country H. pylori Symptoms Just having the bacteria doesn't cause symptoms. But you'll probably notice them if you get stomach inflammation (gastritis) or a peptic ulcer due to H pylori . The most common issue is a dull or burning pain in your belly. The feeling may come and go, and may worsen when your stomach is empty. You may feel better after you eat, drink milk, or take an antacid. Other symptoms include: Bloating Burping No appetite Nausea Vomiting Weight loss for no clear reason What does H. pylori poop look like? Most people infected with H. pylori will have normal-looking poop. But if yours looks dark, black, tarry, or has any blood in it, call your doctor right away. When to Get Emergency Help Sometimes, peptic ulcers bleed into your stomach or intestines. This can be dangerous. Call your doctor right away if you have any of these symptoms: Bloody, dark red, or black poop Trouble breathing Dizziness or fainting Pale skin Vomit that is bloody , black, or looks like coffee grounds Serious, sharp stomach pain An H. pylori infection is also a risk factor for stomach cancer , which has few symptoms at first. Call your doctor if you have any of these signs: Belly pain or swelling Bloating Nausea Loss of appetite Feeling full after you eat just a small amount Vomiting Weight loss for no reason Black poop H. pylori Diagnosis Depending on your symptoms, your doctor will likely ask you about your medical history and any medicines you take. Then they’ll give you a physical exam , which may include checking your belly for swelling, tenderness, or pain. H. pylori tests There are several tests your doctor can use to find out if you're infected with H. pylori , including: Stool tests Stool antigen tests detect proteins (antigens) related to H. pylori in your poop. They're the most common tests used to find the bacteria. Stool PCR tests (polymerase chain reaction tests) look for H. pylori in your poop. They also look for mutations that can make the bacteria antibiotic-resistant. PCR tests are more expensive than antigen tests and may not be as easy to get. Urea breath test During this test, you exhale into a bag so your doctor can measure how much carbon dioxide is in your breath. Then you swallow a liquid or pudding that contains a substance called urea. Several minutes later, you'll exhale into a different bag to measure your carbon dioxide again. The two bags are sent to a lab for comparison. If you have H. pylori in your gut, it will break down the urea in the liquid you swallowed, and carbon dioxide will be released in your breath. If there's more carbon dioxide in the second sample than the first, your test is positive for H. pylori . To look more closely at your ulcers, your doctor may use: Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy . Your doctor uses a tube with a small camera, called an endoscope, to look down your throat and into your stomach and the upper part of your small intestine. The procedure may also be used to collect a sample that will be checked for H. pylori. You may be asleep or awake during the procedure, but you’ll get medicine to make you more comfortable. Upper GI tests. In a hospital, you’ll drink a chalky white liquid that contains a substance called barium, and your doctor will give you an X-ray. The barium coats your throat and stomach and makes them stand out clearly on the image. Computed tomography (CT) scan. This powerful X-ray can be used to detect stomach conditions like peptic ulcers. H. pylori Treatment Ulcers caused b y H. pylori are usually treated with a combination of antibiotics and a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). Triple therapy : Therapies that combine PPIs with two antibiotics remain the first-line options for treating H. pylori . Antibiotics : Your doctor will probably prescribe two antibiotics to keep the bacteria from building up a resistance to a particular one. Amoxicillin , clarithromycin ( Biaxin ), metronidazole ( Flagyl ), tetracycline ( Sumycin ), or tinidazole ( Tindamax ) are likely options. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) : These drugs reduce the acid in your stomach by blocking the tiny ""pumps,"" or glands, that produce it. They include esomeprazole ( Nexium ), lansoprazole ( Prevacid ), omeprazole ( Prilosec ), pantoprazole ( Protonix ), and rabeprazole ( Aciphex ). Bismuth subsalicylate: This medication, often used as an over-the-counter diarrhea remedy, is often recommended along with antibiotics to further protect your stomach. Histamine (H-2) blockers : These block the chemical histamine , which prompts your stomach to make more acid. These include cimetidine ( Tagamet ), and nizatidine ( Axid AR ). H-2 blockers are only used when you can't take PPIs. Triple therapy for H. pylori There are two common types of these three-medication treatments: Rifabutin-based triple therapy, which includes two antibiotics (amoxicillin and rifabutin) and a PPI (omeprazole) that you take together every 8 hours for 14 days. This triple therapy is available as one pill, approved by the FDA in 2019 under the brand name Talicia. Clarithromycin triple therapy also has two antibiotics (clarithromycin and amoxicillin or metronidazole) plus a PPI. This is usually an option in cases where the H. pylori strain has low resistance to clarithromycin. If any of your medications bother you, talk to your doctor about your treatment options and how you can handle side effects. Most ulcers caused by H. pylori will heal after a few weeks. Don't take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen for pain, since they can damage your stomach lining. If you need pain medicine, talk to your doctor. Your doctor may retest you for H. pylori about 4 weeks after you finish your treatment. If you still show signs of an infection, you might need to take another round of different antibiotics. H. pylori Complications H. pylori commonly causes inflammation to the lining of your stomach (gastritis). You don't always have symptoms from gastritis, but the irritation and swelling it causes can lead to discomfort, nausea, and vomiting. Peptic ulcers are the most common complication of H. pylori . About 10% of those infected with the bacteria will get one. A serious one could: Block digested food from leaving your stomach Leave a hole in the wall of your stomach Cause bleeding It’s not common, but an untreated long-term H. pylori infection is a risk factor for some types of stomach cancer . The disease has few symptoms at first, such as heartburn. Over time, you may notice: Belly pain or swelling Nausea Not feeling hungry Feeling full after you eat just a small amount Vomiting Weight loss for no reason Call your doctor if you show any of these signs. If you have a history of stomach cancer in your family, your doctor may recommend testing for H. pylori. Prevention You can protect yourself from getting an H. pylori infection the same ways you keep other germs at bay: Wash your hands thoroughly after you use the bathroom and before you prepare or eat food. Teach your children to do the same. Avoid eating food or drinking water that’s not clean. Don’t eat anything that isn’t cooked thoroughly. Avoid food served by people who haven’t washed their hands. H. pylori diet While the main risk factors for H. pylori infection are poor sanitation and hygiene practices, research shows that what you eat also may play a role. One study found that people whose diets were high in fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, nuts, and seeds had lower risks of H. pylori infection. But those whose diets were full of carbohydrates, processed grains and meats, sugars, and salt were more likely to have H. pylori infections. This could be because some compounds like vitamin C, polyphenols, and flavonoids in the first group's diet help protect the stomach lining and prevent the bacteria from establishing. But we need more research to know for sure. Takeaways H. pylori is a common type of bacteria that attacks the stomach lining. It's usually passed from person to person. Most infections are harmless. But the bacteria is to blame for most peptic stomach ulcers, and if it's not treated, it could be a risk factor for stomach cancer. The most effective treatments include a combination of antibiotics and proton pump inhibitors. H. pylori FAQs Is H. pylori a serious infection? Most people infected with H. pylori don't have any problems. But the bacteria can do serious damage to your stomach lining and is the leading cause of peptic ulcers. In rare cases, it can lead to stomach cancer. Can H. pylori be easily cured? You can treat the symptoms of an H. pylori infection with antibiotics, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), and H-2 blockers. Treatment takes about 2 weeks. Once the bacteria are gone, there's little chance the infection will return if you follow good hygiene practices."
1,Hereditary Angioedema (HAE),"What Is Hereditary Angioedema? Hereditary angioedema is a rare genetic condition that causes swelling under the skin and lining of the gut and lungs. It can happen in different parts of your body. You are born with hereditary angioedema (HAE). Although you’ll always have it, treatment helps you manage it. There have been big improvements in treatment, and researchers continue to look for new solutions. Symptoms most often initially show up in childhood and get worse during the teen years. Many people don't know HAE is causing their swelling until they're adults. Where you have it on your body, how often the bouts happen, and how strong they are different for everyone. The attacks can come and go as well as move to different spots during the same bout. The swelling typically goes away on its own but can also occur as a life-threatening event. Your throat can swell. That can cut off your airways and could be deadly. So if you know you have HAE and you feel any change like that, call 911 right away. The frequency of attacks can vary. You can have attacks as often as every 1 to 2 weeks or 1 to 2 per year, and they can be hard to manage. Causes With this disease, a certain protein in your body is not in balance. This causes tiny blood vessels to push fluid into nearby areas of your body. That leads to sudden swelling. A problem with a gene that makes a blood protein called C1 inhibitor often causes HAE. In most cases, you don’t have enough of this protein. In others, you have normal levels but it doesn't work right. For the most common form of HAE, if one of your parents has HAE, you have a 50% change of having it, too. But sometimes the gene change happens for unknown reasons. If you have the broken gene, you can pass it on to your children. Symptoms The main symptom is swelling. You won’t have the itching or hives that people often get with allergic reactions. A bout may last 2 to 5 days. It can happen in different parts of the body: Mouth or throat Hands Feet Face Genitals Belly Swelling in the throat is the most dangerous symptom. Puffiness in the feet and hands can be painful and make it hard to go about your daily life. Swelling in your belly can cause: Extreme pain Nausea Vomiting Diarrhea You may notice warning signs before swelling begins. These may include: Extreme fatigue Muscle ache Tingling Headache Belly pain Hoarseness Mood changes Triggers Although you may not be able to tell what your triggers are, common ones include: Stress or anxiety Minor injury or surgery Illnesses such as colds or flu Physical activities such as typing, hammering, or pushing a lawn mower Medications, including some used for high blood pressure and congestive heart failure Women may notice a difference in the number or sharpness of attacks when they: Have their period Are pregnant. For some women, it doesn't happen as often when they’re pregnant, but then the attacks come back after they give birth. Use birth control or hormone replacement therapy containing estrogen. Women usually say they have more and worse attacks while on these medicines. Getting a Diagnosis If you've had symptoms of HAE, your doctor may ask: What changes have you noticed? Where have you had swelling? How often? Have you had any in your face, neck, tongue, or throat? Have you noticed any changes that happen before swelling begins? Have you had any stomach problems or stomach surgery? Does anyone in your family have a problem with swelling? Have you or anyone in your family been treated for allergies? The right diagnosis is key. Sometimes people are treated for allergies when it's really HAE that causes their swelling. Antihistamines and corticosteroids that treat allergies don’t work well for this disease. You can have severe stomach swelling, pain, and diarrhea and severe dehydration and if misdiagnosed, it can lead to surgery you don't need. Your doctor will do a physical exam. You'll need blood tests, too, to confirm that it’s HAE. If you do have it, ask your doctor to refer you to a specialist familiar with the condition. You should also ask your doctor about having other members of your family tested, even if no one has symptoms. Questions for Your Doctor Do I need more tests? What can I expect from this condition? Which treatments do you recommend? What are their side effects? What should I do if my throat swells? How likely is that? How can I find out what triggers my attacks? Will I pass this condition on to my children? Should my family get tested for HAE? Will this affect my plans to have a family? Treatment Doctors can use medications to treat or prevent attacks: Berotralstat (Orladeyo) C1 esterase inhibitor ( Berinert , Cinryze , Haegarda) Conestat alfa ( Ruconest ) Ecallantide ( Kalbitor ) Icatibant ( Firazyr ) Lanadelumab-flyo ( Takhzyro ) You may also need oxygen or IV fluids to ease your symptoms. Your doctor will make recommendations for what you need. Taking Care of Yourself Learn as much as you can about HAE so you can make informed decisions about your treatment and medications that you should be cautious with. If you can figure out your triggers, you can better avoid them. It helps to track your attacks and symptoms in a journal and look for patterns. Talk to your doctor before you have any dental work. They may want you to take medication to avoid a flare. Also talk with your doctor before you take any new prescription medicines. There is a chance they could trigger an attack. Carry your medical information with you at all times. If your child has HAE, note any changes in behavior that you see before an attack. As they get older, they'll need to learn their triggers and treatment needs. Make sure all caregivers and family members know about the condition and what to do if an attack happens. Remember: Any swelling in the throat is an emergency. Take your medication for attacks and call 911. Connect with others who are living with HAE. They can share their insights and tips to help you manage your symptoms. What to Expect There's no cure for HAE, but new treatments have made it possible for people to manage their symptoms and enjoy active lives. Getting Support To learn more about HAE and to find the support of others who have it, visit the website of the U.S. Hereditary Angioedema Association at www.haea.org."
2,Trichotillomania: Understanding the Hairpulling Disorder,"What Is Trichotillomania? Trichotillomania is a type of impulse control disorder where people have an irresistible urge to pull out their hair , usually from their scalp, eyelashes, and eyebrows. It's also called hairpulling, hairpulling disorder, TTM, and trich. Mental health professionals think of trichotillomania as a “body-focused repetitive behavior.” Body-focused repetitive behaviors are habits like pulling your hair, biting your nails, or chewing on your lips that become extreme or get in the way of enjoying life. Most commonly, people with trichotillomania pull out hair from their scalp. They may also pull out their eyelashes, eyebrows, facial hair (like beards or mustaches), or armpit, leg, or pubic hair. Often, they pull when they're stressed or bored as a way to soothe themselves. Trichotillomania is a type of impulse control disorder. People with these disorders know that it might be harmful if they act on an impulse like hairpulling, but they cannot stop themselves. Trichotillomania can cause hair loss, including uneven bald patches, that can make people feel self-conscious or embarrassed. This can lead to emotional distress or avoiding social situations. Even though having trichotillomania or pulling your hair is not your fault, there can be social stigma around talking about it. How common is trichotillomania? Doctors aren't sure exactly how common trichotillomania is because many people who have it don't tell their doctors. Stigma can make it hard to ask for help. Scientists think 3.5% of all people experience hairpulling at some point in their life, and it might be higher. Trichotillomania is an impulse control disorder sometimes caused by anxiety or stress. This condition can start in childhood and last a lifetime. (Photo credit: Richard Usatine, MD) Why does pulling hair feel good? For many people with trichotillomania, hairpulling is a response to stress, frustration, or boredom. It can feel comforting and give you a place to direct your energy or something to do. Even if you know you might feel upset about it later, pulling can feel pleasant and satisfying in the moment. It might also help you feel in control during stressful situations. Hairpulling can become a habit. This creates a cycle in your brain where you think about the habit and feel the urge to do it. When you do, your brain releases “reward” chemicals like dopamine, which makes you feel happy and calm. Your body then connects doing the habit with feeling good, which in turn strengthens the habit and makes the urge to do it more intense. For people who feel a strong urge to pull, actually pulling can bring a sense of relief because they are no longer focused on the urge. Some people with trichotillomania have rituals or routines related to hairpulling, like choosing which hair to pull or smelling, looking at, playing with, or eating hair you pull out. Rituals of all kinds can be soothing or pleasing to people. Many people also enjoy the sensory experience of the rituals they develop around hairpulling. This can involve any of the senses, such as the sound of pulling out a hair or rubbing it against your hand, the feeling or taste of hair in your mouth, or other sensations. Hairpulling sometimes helps people feel in control of unpleasant physical sensations. For example, some people with trichotillomania who pull on their eyelashes say that they feel an eyelash getting in the way when they blink, so they try to remove the one that's bothering them. In the process, they end up pulling out more eyelashes or get in the habit of pulling. Other people say they feel itchiness or tingling in the area they pull on, and pulling helps get at the itch. Trichotillomania Symptoms The main symptom of trichotillomania is pulling out your hair, often to the point that you have hair loss or bald patches. People with trichotillomania often try to stop pulling but can't. They also say that pulling has negative effects on their lives, self-esteem, or well-being. Pulling can be focused or automatic. With automatic pulling, you aren't aware that you're doing it. Automatic pulling might happen when you're studying, reading, or watching TV and not paying attention. Automatic pulling can be a response to feeling bored. With focused pulling, people know that they are doing it but can't stop themselves. Focused pulling can be a way to ease stress or soothe yourself. People sometimes have rituals or routines for focused pulling, like playing with the hair you pull, tasting it, or smelling it. You might feel relieved or calmer after focused pulling. Most of the time, people with trichotillomania pull out their hair with their fingers, but you might also use tweezers or other tools. Other signs of trichotillomania Besides repeated hairpulling, other signs of trichotillomania may include: Feeling tense before pulling out your hair or if you try to resist the urge to pull Feeling relieved, satisfied, or pleased after acting on the impulse to pull hair Distress or problems at work, at school, or in your social life due to hairpulling Avoiding situations where people might find out that you pull hair or have hair loss, like sleepovers, swimming, going outside in windy weather, hair salons or barber shops, changing rooms, or sexual intimacy with a partner Conflicts or tension with your friends or family related to pulling Irritated or sore skin from pulling or a tingling feeling or itch that makes you want to pull Scars or damage to your skin, scalp, or hair follicles Rituals like chewing on the hair you pull out, inspecting the hair root, twirling the hair, putting the hair between your teeth , or eating hair A preference for certain types or textures of hair Changes to how you look because of hair loss Bare patches where your hair has been pulled out Pulling fibers from blankets and clothing or hair from pets or dolls If you have trichotillomania, you could also have other body-focused repetitive behaviors, like nail biting, skin picking, or chewing on your lips or cheeks. About 1 in 5 people with trichotillomania also have trichophagia, a related condition that causes you to eat the hair you pull out. If you eat hair, it can lead to problems with digestion like throwing up, nausea, and stomachaches. Over time, you might get blockages or holes in your digestive tract as hair builds up. Many people who have trichotillomania feel embarrassed or ashamed to let other people know they pull. They may try to hide their bald patches or hair loss with hats, scarves, or wigs. They might also wear false eyelashes or use makeup to try to cover up the physical effects of trichotillomania. This can be expensive or take a lot of time to do. Some people will stay at home or avoid social situations if they are self-conscious about their hair loss or pulling. Trichotillomania Causes The exact cause of trichotillomania isn't known. Scientists are still learning about it, but they think it might be linked to differences in the parts of your brain related to impulse control, learning, emotion, and movement. It might also be connected to brain chemicals, psychology, your environment, and stress. Some things may boost your risk of trichotillomania, including: Age. Young children sometimes pull out their hair as a way of soothing themselves, and they often outgrow it. More serious forms of trichotillomania often start in the early teens, between ages 10 and 13. Some doctors think it might be linked to the changes in your hormones that happen during puberty. Trichotillomania can last your whole life, though symptoms may come and go. Genes. In some families, the tendency to trichotillomania may be passed on. You're more likely to get it if other people in your family have it . Gender. People of all genders can have trichotillomania. In children and teenagers, the rate of trichotillomania is the same across genders. But adult women are up to nine times more likely than adults of other genders to get diagnosed with it. Some scientists think that this is because people who identify as women might be more likely to tell their doctors about hairpulling or that doctors might pay more attention when women talk about it. Some doctors think hormone changes might affect trichotillomania in people who get periods (menstruate). Other mental health disorders. If you live with trichotillomania, you may have other mental health conditions, such as anxiety, depression, or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Stress. Extreme stress may trigger trichotillomania in some people. Stress can be caused by situations including family conflict, abuse, or the death of a friend or family member. Boredom. Some people start pulling their hair as a way to cope with being bored and then it becomes a habit. Trichotillomania Diagnosis Your doctor or mental health care professional can diagnose you with trichotillomania based on your symptoms. There are no specific tests for it, but your doctor will ask you questions about your habits, stress levels, and experiences pulling your hair. They'll check to make sure you don't have other conditions that could cause pulling or hair loss. Sometimes, your doctor might take a very small piece of skin to look for certain kinds of damage that can happen from pulling. This is called a punch biopsy. They might also look at your hair under a microscope to see if it looks like it's been pulled out and grown back or look at how much hair you are missing. They may take pictures of your bald patches to help track if treatment works over time. They might send you to a psychiatrist, psychologist, therapist, or other mental health care professional. Your mental health care provider will also ask questions about your hairpulling, your life, and your overall mental health to help figure out what's going on. They will help you learn ways to manage your trichotillomania. Doctors use a guidebook called the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , Fifth edition (DSM-5), to diagnose mental health conditions, including trichotillomania. According to the DSM-5, people with trichotillomania have these five things in common: You pull your hair out. You have tried to stop yourself from pulling but couldn't resist the urge. You feel distressed or upset about pulling or it has negative effects on your life or self-esteem. Your pulling isn't caused by another medical issue. Your pulling isn't caused by another mental health issue. Trichotillomania Treatment Treatment options for trichotillomania include: Therapy Many types of therapy can support people with trichotillomania and even help them stop hairpulling completely. Acceptance and commitment therapy. You'll be able to practice accepting the hairpulling urges without actually hairpulling. Habit reversal. This is often the main treatment of trichotillomania. It'll help you practice other, less harmful habits instead of hairpulling, like clenching your fists when you have the urge to pull your hair. Cognitive therapy. This helps people explore and change the beliefs that lead to hairpulling. Medications There are no FDA-approved medications for trichotillomania, but these drugs may control symptoms in some people: Antidepressants Atypical antipsychotics N-acetyl cysteine, an amino acid supplement Trichotillomania Self-Care People with trichotillomania have come up with different ways to help themselves resist the urge to pull. These include: Distractions. Some people might play with a fidget toy or stress ball, knit or crochet, give themselves a manicure, doodle, do a craft project like wood carving or origami, or something else to keep their hands busy when they are bored or feel the urge to pull. New routines or rituals. Many people with trichotillomania have specific routines around pulling that feel good to them. Some people try to create new routines to do instead of pulling. Some examples are repeating a saying you like, giving yourself a hand massage, doing physical exercise, or tightening and then releasing different muscles. Stress management and mindfulness. Sometimes, people pull in response to stress. It might be helpful to use stress management techniques like deep breathing, meditation, or taking a hot bath until the urge goes away. Different sensations. Many people with trichotillomania enjoy certain sensory aspects of pulling, chewing on or smelling their hair, or playing with it in their hands. They might feel itchiness or tingling in the area they pull. Using itch relief cream, putting a washcloth or cold water on the area, or doing something that has a sensation you enjoy might be useful. Making it harder to get to your hair. People sometimes wear hats, scarves, or bandanas to stop themselves from pulling. They might tie their hair back in braids, ponytails, locs, or other styles that make it harder to reach or cut it short. If you use tools like tweezers to pull, you can try hiding them or putting them in a different place each time you use them. Your doctor or mental health professional can help you figure out which ideas might work best for you. Together, you will come up with a personalized plan to treat your trichotillomania. They will work with you to learn and practice different strategies. Trichotillomania Complications Like other body-focused repetitive behaviors, trichotillomania can cause great distress to people who have it. Without treatment, it can lead to different kinds of complications including: Emotional issues and stigma. People say they feel ashamed or embarrassed about pulling or hair loss. T his can affect self-esteem and self-confidence. People who are too embarrassed to talk about their pulling might feel like they are carrying a big secret or weight. Even though it's not the person's fault, there is still stigma around having trichotillomania. People might worry that no one will understand or that they are the only ones who pull. This can all lead to shame, guilt, or other difficult feelings. These feelings might affect their relationships with their loved ones. Problems at work, at school, or in social settings. People with trichotillomania may avoid friendships, relationships, and intimacy. They might turn down school or job opportunities because they feel down about themselves or embarrassed about pulling. They also might avoid situations like changing rooms, swimming, sleepovers, and overnight trips, where other people might be more likely to notice their pulling or hair loss. This can lead to isolation, feeling left out, or feeling like you don't belong. Damage to your scalp, skin, or hair. People with trichotillomania often have hair loss or bald or uneven patches on their scalp, body, or face. Repeated pulling can leave tiny scars on your scalp, skin, or hair follicles. Sometimes, this scarring makes it harder for the hair to grow back. People can also get infections or damage to the tissue. Complications from eating hair (trichophagia). About half of all people with trichotillomania put the hair they pull in their mouth in some way, and 1 in 5 swallow or eat it. Hair is hard for your body to break down, so swallowing it can lead to digestive system problems like stomachaches, nausea, throwing up, or blockages. It's rare, but sometimes, undigested hair can clump together in your digestive tract and form a tight wad or ball, called a trichobezoar. Trichobezoars can cause blockages and holes in your intestines or other digestive organs, ulcers, weight loss, and other problems. It's important to see a doctor right away if you swallow the hair you pull and you start to have any digestive system issues. If you have a trichobezoar, your doctor will do surgery to take it out. Trichotillomania and eyebrows Some people with trichotillomania also pull out the hair from their eyebrows. This goes beyond usual grooming, and people have trouble resisting the urge to pull their eyebrows. You might use your fingers, tweezers, or other tools. If you only pull your eyebrows, and not any other hair, it's sometimes considered a minor form of trichotillomania. Some people feel itchiness or tingling in their eyebrows and pull in response. Other people pull or over-pluck their eyebrows because they are worried about how they look or to help themselves deal with stress. The skin near your eyebrows is sensitive and can easily get hurt from pulling. If you end up with damage to this area, it will be harder for them to grow back, and they might not be able to grow back all the way. In general, it takes about 3-4 months for eyebrow hair to grow, and it might take longer if your hair or skin has been affected by pulling. To help prevent damage, doctors say to pull your eyebrow hair in the same direction it grows and use angled metal tweezers with sharp, skinny points. Tweezers with rubber tips or wide, flat points are rougher on your hair and skin, which makes it harder for eyebrows to grow back. A doctor or mental health professional can help you recover from trichotillomania and stop pulling. Some people also put cold water, a wet washcloth, coconut oil, or anti-itch cream on their eyebrows. They might also hide their mirrors or tweezers or wear clear glasses to stop themselves from plucking. If you are trying to get your eyebrows to grow back, some doctors recommend taking vitamins like iron, omega-3 supplements, biotin, and a multivitamin. Always check with your doctor about any vitamins or supplements you want to take. Your doctor might give you certain medications or creams to help eyebrow hair grow back. In some severe cases where eyebrows don't grow back, they might suggest getting permanent eyebrow tattoos or hair transplants. Trichotillomania and eyelashes Pulling out your eyelashes can be an issue for you if you have trichotillomania. Eyelashes can be painful to pull, and scientists think that the pain might lead to relief or pleasure. People who pull their eyelashes sometimes say that they feel an eyelash getting caught when they blink, so they try to remove it. People may pull their lower or upper eyelashes or both. Because eyelashes protect your eyes from dust and other irritating things, pulling them out can make you more likely to get eye infections and injuries. Pulling can also hurt the delicate skin on your eyelids, which makes it harder for eyelashes to grow back. If you pull your eyelashes, your eye doctor might tell you to put eye ointment on your eyelids to moisten the area and help the hair grow back. In general, eyelashes replace themselves in 6-10 weeks, but it might take longer if your eyelids are damaged from pulling. Your eye doctor might recommend medications or special creams to help your eyelashes grow back. These treatments can have risks, so make sure to let them know if you pull to help them find the right treatment for you. Eating plenty of fruits, vegetables, protein, and foods with iron in them (red meat, beans, etc.) may help your eyelashes grow faster. Trichotillomania Prevention There is no proven way to prevent trichotillomania, but getting treatment as soon as symptoms start can be a big help. Learning stress management is also a good idea because stress often triggers hairpulling behavior. Takeaways Trichotillomania is an uncontrollable urge to pull out your hair that can lead to hair loss, bald patches, and feelings of shame, embarrassment, or isolation. Many people with trichotillomania try to hide their pulling, but help is available. If you struggle with hairpulling, talk to your doctor or a mental health professional. Trichotillomania FAQs Is trichotillomania an OCD or anxiety? According to some experts, trichotillomania is a type of OCD. OCD is a mental health condition that causes overwhelming thoughts that are hard to move on from, called obsessions. These obsessions lead to compulsions, which are actions that you can't stop yourself from doing over and over. People with OCD often feel anxiety or fear about their obsessions. For example, someone might worry obsessively about things being out of order and feel a compulsion to arrange their things in a certain order. While everyone has some obsessive thoughts or compulsions once in a while, if you have OCD, these thoughts and actions have strong, negative effects on your life and make it hard to do daily tasks. Like the urge to pull for people with trichotillomania, they can be very hard or impossible to ignore. Other experts think that trichotillomania is different from OCD, for a few reasons: First of all, many people with trichotillomania feel satisfied, relieved, or happier after they pull. People with OCD usually don't feel better after they do one of their compulsions. Also, people with trichotillomania often pull without thinking about it and don't have obsessive thoughts like with OCD. Treatment of trichotillomania and OCD is often different. Because of this, trichotillomania and OCD can be thought of as “cousins.” Trichotillomania is also linked to anxiety, but scientists don't fully understand the relationship. For example, some people with trichotillomania might feel anxious or depressed because they are embarrassed about pulling. Other people might start pulling as a way to deal with stress or anxiety. We do know that about 3 out of 5 people with trichotillomania also have anxiety. Make sure to tell your care team if you experience obsessive thoughts, compulsions, anxiety, or fear. Your mental health professional can help you figure out if you have OCD or an anxiety disorder and include helping you feel better in your treatment plan. Is trichotillomania related to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)? ADHD is a mental health condition that affects focus, attention, activity, and concentration. While ADHD is not an impulse control disorder like trichotillomania, it can cause problems with impulse control. For this reason, scientists think ADHD and trichotillomania might have some connection with each other, but scientists are still learning about these links. So far, studies have shown that people with trichotillomania are more likely to also have ADHD. In one study that looked at people with trichotillomania, almost 1 in 6 also had ADHD. In general, only about 2 or 3 out of 100 people have ADHD. People who have ADHD and trichotillomania might have more issues with controlling their impulses than people who only have one condition. Scientists think some people with ADHD might pull to help themselves focus. People who have trouble paying attention also might not notice if they are pulling out their hair."
3,Behcet’s Syndrome,"What Is Behcet’s Syndrome? Behcet’s syndrome (also called Behcet’s disease) is rare condition that causes your body’s blood vessels to swell. This can cause symptoms throughout your body. Sores inside your mouth and on your genitals are common, but you may also have symptoms in other areas. There’s no cure for Behcet’s syndrome, but there are ways to treat the symptoms. Behcet’s Syndrome Signs and Symptoms Behcet’s syndrome is different for everyone. Some people have only mild symptoms. Others have more serious problems. Your symptoms often come and go. Bouts of symptoms are called flares. Going long periods without symptoms is called remission. Most people with Behcet’s syndrome have sores in the mouth and on the genitals. But the swelling of blood vessels it causes can bring on symptoms throughout your body: Mouth: Sores on the lips, tongue , and inside of the cheek Mouth pain Eyes : Swelling in the front or back of the eye , called uveitis Blurry vision Sensitivity to light Tearing Redness Pain Vision loss Genitals: Sores on the scrotum in men Sores on the vulva in women Skin : Bumps that look like acne Red lumps on the legs and ankles Joints: Pain in the knees, ankles, wrists, and elbows Joint swelling Brain and spinal cord: Fever Headache Stiff neck Confusion Personality changes Memory loss Trouble speaking Digestive system : Stomach pain Diarrhea Bleeding from sores in the stomach and intestines Sometimes, Behcet’s affects other organs, like the kidneys and lungs . Behcet’s Syndrome Causes and Risk Factors Doctors aren’t sure what causes Behcet’s syndrome. They believe it starts when the immune system mistakenly attacks the blood vessels. You’re more likely to get it if you have a problem with your immune system. Some people inherit genes that cause their immune system to attack the blood vessels. Doctors believe an infection or something else in the environment triggers the condition in those who have the gene. Risk factors Some things can make you more likely to have Behcet’s syndrome, including: Age: Although you can get it at any age, it usually shows up when you’re in your 20s or 30s. Genes: Certain genes (a portion of your DNA) are linked to this condition. Sex: Although anyone can get it, it affects more men, more severely, than women. Where you live: Behcet’s syndrome is very rare in the U.S. It’s more common in the Middle East and Asia. Behcet’s Syndrome Diagnosis Because there are so many different symptoms, Behcet’s syndrome can be hard to diagnose. It has symptoms similar to many other conditions, including Crohn’s disease, lupus , and arthritis . Your doctor may want to give you a blood test to rule out other conditions. It can take months to find out for sure that you have Behcet’s. Doctors will look at your medical history, do a physical exam , and look for groups of symptoms. You may be diagnosed with Behcet’s if you have mouth sores at least three times in a year, and you have at least two of these symptoms: Sores on your genitals Swelling in your eyes , along with vision loss Skin sores Positive pathergy test: Your doctor will prick your arm with a small needle. If a bump forms in that spot 1 or 2 days later, it’s a good clue that you may have the condition. It indicates an overreaction by your immune system to a small injury. Doctors who treat Behcet’s Which doctors you see will depend on your symptoms: Eye swelling: Ophthalmologist Skin sores or mouth ulcers: Dermatologist Sore joints: Rheumatologist Genital sores: Urologist Sores in the stomach or intestines : Gastroenterologist Blood problems: Hematologist Brain and nervous system problems: Neurologist Because you may have many symptoms, you may need to visit several of these doctors. Behcet’s Syndrome Treatment Your treatments will be based on your symptoms. Corticosteroids can calm the immune system and bring down swelling in your body. Other medicines that work to help your immune system response can also be prescribed, such as adalimumab ( Humira ), azathioprine ( Imuran ), cyclophosphamide , cyclosporine ( Neoral , Sandimmune ), and infliximab ( Remicade ). Creams or ointments can ease skin and genital sores. Your doctor may recommend nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs , or NSAIDs , and colchicine for joint pain and swelling. Steroid eye drops can bring down eye swelling. Behcet’s Syndrome Complications Depending on your symptoms, it’s possible you could get complications from Behcet’s syndrome. But not everyone will. It’s important to see your doctor if you are noticing new symptoms. For example, if you have eye inflammation that goes untreated, it can result in loss of vision . Treatment can help prevent this. Blood clots can also cause serious complications. A pulmonary artery aneurism (when there’s a bulge in your artery that can burst) is rare but can be fatal. Inflammation in your brain or spinal cord can also cause disability. Always call your doctor if you have questions or new symptoms. Behcet’s Syndrome Outlook You can live an active life with Behcet’s. Your symptoms might get better as you grow older. There may be periods of time when all symptoms disappear. For some, the symptoms get worse over time. Medicines help control these symptoms and prevent flares."
4,What's Wrong With My Toe?,"Toes are small, but they have a large job. They help you walk and run and keep your balance, too. So if your toe hurts, it can be a big deal. There are a lot of reasons you may have an aching toe. There's always the chance you stubbed it, of course, or banged it up while playing sports. But there are also problems like hammertoe or arthritis that could be to blame. Watch out for some telltale symptoms and check with your doctor to figure out the cause. Hammertoe, Mallet Toe, and Claw Toe If one or more of your toes are crooked or curled under, you may have hammer, mallet, or claw toe. Your foot has a strange shape because the muscles, tendons, or ligaments that surround your toe aren't balanced. This causes the toes to bend in an odd position. Your toe may hurt. It's also common to develop a corn or callus because the joint rubs the inside of your shoe. Each condition has its own distinctive look: Hammertoe. The middle joint of your toe bends downwards. This causes your toe to rise up instead of lying flat. It usually occurs in your second, third, and fourth toes. Mallet toe. Your toe bends down at the joint closest to the nail. Like hammertoe, it often happens in your second, third, and fourth toes. Claw toe. Like the name suggests, your toes make a claw shape. The joint at the base of the toe bends up, while the two other joints bend down. This causes your toe to curl and dig into the soles of your shoes. Causes. A main cause is wearing high heels or shoes that don't fit properly. Too-tight shoes can crowd your toes, forcing them into a bent position. After a while, the muscles tighten and shorten. Pretty soon you can't straighten your toe. You may be more likely to get these problems because of your genes. For instance, your risk goes up if you have a certain foot shape, such as a long second toe. Some diseases, such as arthritis and diabetes , can also lead to trouble. Treatments. If you can still flex your toe, your doctor may suggest exercises to stretch and strengthen the muscles. They include scrunching a towel and picking things up off the floor with your toes. Wearing roomy shoes can also help. They should be at least a half-inch longer than the big toe. Your doctor may recommend wearing shoe inserts or pads to relieve some of the pressure. Over time, the bend in your toe may become permanent and rigid. These cases are more serious. You may need surgery. Turf Toe and Stiff Big Toe (Hallux Rigidus) Does only your big toe ache? You could have a condition called turf toe or the aptly named stiff big toe (hallux rigidus). Turf toe. It's a sprain to the joint at the bottom of your big toe. This injury causes pain and swelling. You may not be able to move your big toe much. Walking and other weight-bearing activities can make it ache more. Causes. You can get turf toe if you bend your big toe upward too much. Running or jumping can also jam the big toe. Over time these movements can lead to a sprain. You often get it when you dance or play sports like soccer or football. Treatments. Your doctor may suggest a home remedy called RICE: rest, ice, compression, and elevation. You'll need to stay off the foot, ice the toe for 20 minutes every 4 hours, wrap it with a medical bandage, and prop up your foot to ease swelling. You may also have to wear a walking boot or stiff-soled shoe to keep from moving the toe. Stiff big toe. It's a type of arthritis that leads to pain and stiffness in the joint at the base of your big toe. You're more likely to get it if you're between 30 and 60. Causes. Athletes or workers who are on their feet a lot may overuse the big toe. That puts stress on the joint. An injury or disease, such as osteoarthritis , can also lead to the condition. Your genes may also be partly to blame. Treatments. In the early stages, you can treat stiff big toe with anti-inflammatory medicine and hot or cold packs to relieve the pain. Steroid shots also ease the swelling. Your doctor may suggest you wear wide shoes with thick, curved soles. If the pain doesn't go away, you may need surgery. Morton's Neuroma Do you have a tingling pain in your toes or the ball of your foot? Nerve damage like Morton's neuroma could be the cause. Besides tingling or numbness in your toes, you may also get a feeling like you're standing on a pebble or have a burning pain in the ball of your foot. It's most common between the third and fourth toes. Causes. It's not entirely certain what causes Morton's Neuroma, but one of the nerves that leads to your toes becomes irritated, likely involving collapse of the transverse arch that places traction and increased pressure on the interdigital nerve. That's usually caused by pressure that's due to a foot problem like bunions , hammertoes, or too-tight shoes. You can also get it if you play sports where your feet pound the ground, such as running. Females are approximately five times more likely than males to develop Morton neuroma. Wearing high-heels has also been linked to Morton's neuroma. You can get relief from symptoms if you switch to shoes with lower heels and more room for your toes. Treatments. Arch supports that you put in your shoe can bring relief. You can buy them over-the-counter, or your doctor may prescribe one that's custom-made. If the pain keeps up, you may need steroid shots or surgery. Broken Toe or Bone Bruise Swollen, painful toes could mean you have a bone injury like a broken toe or a bone bruise. Broken toe. Your toe may be broken if it swells, throbs, and looks bruised. Also called a fracture, this injury hurts. The pain may get worse when you stand or walk. Causes. There's often no mystery about why it happens. It could be that you stubbed your toe or dropped something heavy on it. Sometimes, though, you can get tiny breaks in the bone from the regular impact of activities such as running and basketball. This is called a stress fracture. Treatments. Most of the time, you won't need surgery. To help your bone heal, the ends will have to be set in place. You may have to wear a cast, brace, or a stiff-bottomed shoe. If you broke one of your smaller toes, your doctor may tape the broken toe to the one next to it. The healthy toe acts like a splint to injured one. It usually takes 1 or 2 months to heal. Bone bruise. When the blood vessels in your bone are damaged, they may leak blood and fluid. This is called a bone bruise. It can happen to any bone in the body, including your toes. The symptoms are similar to a broken toe: swelling, pain, and a change in color -- but it's not as serious. Your doctor will order an X-ray to rule out a broken toe. Causes. Just like a broken toe, you may get this problem if you bang your toe or stub it or drop something on it. Arthritis can also lead to the injury. Treatments. You'll recover on your own after about 1 or 2 months. Your doctor will recommend resting and icing your toe. You can also reduce the swelling if you prop up your foot and take anti-inflammatory drugs. You may need to wear a brace. Eating foods with plenty of calcium , vitamin D , and protein can also help you heal. Gout It's a common cause of pain in the toe. Your big toe is often a place where gout flares up. Besides pain, you may also get redness, swelling, and warmth in the joint. Causes. Gout is a type of inflammatory arthritis. It's caused by a buildup of uric acid crystals in your joint. Treatments. Your doctor may suggest medications that can ease pain and swelling or reduce your levels of uric acid. You may also ice your toe and raise your joint. Drink plenty of liquids (but not alcohol ). Try to avoid stress , since that can make your gout worse."
5,Hammertoe,"What Are Hammertoes? A hammertoe happens when the muscles and ligaments around your toe joint get out of balance. This makes the middle joint of your toe buckle and get stuck in this position. You’re most likely to see hammertoe in your middle three toes. Toes that curl are also hammertoes. This happens most often with baby toes. There are two types: Flexible hammertoes. If  you can still move your toe at the joint, it's a flexible hammertoe. That's good, because it means you have a  milder form of the problem. There may be several treatment options. Rigid hammertoes. If the tendons in  your toe get rigid, they press the joint out of alignment. At this stage, you can’t move your  toe. It usually means you need surgery. Hammertoe Symptoms The main symptom of hammertoe is a toe or toes that look bent upward in the middle. Because of these buckled toes, you may have: Blisters and calluses from where your toes rub against the top of your shoes Pain in your toe joint where it meets your foot Pain when you walk Stiffness in the bent toes that gets worse over time Hammertoe Causes and Risk Factors The muscles of each toe work in pairs. When the toe muscles get out of balance, a hammertoe can form. Muscle imbalance puts a lot of pressure on your toe's tendons and joints. This pressure forces your toe into a hammerhead shape. Causes include: Shoes that don’t fit. If your shoes are too tight, too short, or too pointy, they push your toes out of balance. Pointy, high-heeled shoes put particularly severe pressure on the toes. Arthritis Alcoholism Charcot-Tooth-Marie disease, a disorder that damages the nerves in your arms and legs Spinal cord tumors Polio Stroke High arches Feet that rotate inward when you walk Bunions Your risk of getting hammertoes goes up with: Flat feet Genes: You may have inherited conditions or features that make your feet unstable. Age Long toe bones: If your second toe is longer than your first, it’s at a higher risk of hammertoe. Women are more likely than men to get pain from hammertoes because of the types of shoes they wear. Hammertoes can be a serious problem in people with diabetes or poor circulation because they have a higher risk for infections and foot ulcers. Custom orthopedic shoes may prevent these complications. People with these conditions should see a doctor at the first sign of foot trouble. Hammertoe Diagnosis Your doctor should be able to tell if you have hammertoes by looking closely at your feet and asking you about your symptoms. If they want more detailed information about your foot and toe joints or bones, you may also get an X-ray. Hammertoe Treatment To relieve some of the symptoms of hammertoe, your doctor may suggest: Roomier shoes that extend at least a half inch past your toes Inserts or pads in your shoes that reposition your toes to relieve pain Special exercises that stretch and strengthen your toes Taping or splinting your toe to make it straight Ice packs on your toes to relieve pain and swelling Nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen or naproxen to help with pain and swelling Steroid injections in severely swollen or painful toe joints. If your hammertoe is severe, you may have surgery to correct it. It may be an option if your pain has gotten very bad, your toe is very rigid, or you have an open sore because of your hammertoe. There are several surgery options: Arthroplasty. A surgeon takes half of the joint under each crooked toe so it can lie flat. Arthrodesis. A surgeon takes out the whole joint under your crooked toes and inserts a wire to help it straighten as it heals. Tendon transfer. A surgeon attaches tendons under your toe to the top of your toe to help it straighten out. Basal phalangectomy. A surgeon takes out the base of the bone under your hammertoe. Weil osteotomy. A surgeon shortens certain bones in your foot and then puts screws in them."
6,"Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease (HFMD) Explained","What Is Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease? Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is a contagious viral infection that's common in children. The disease causes sores called ulcers inside or around the mouth and a rash or blisters on your hands, feet , legs, or buttocks. It can be painful but isn't serious. Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) causes blistering of the hands, feet, and inside of the mouth. While anyone can get it, it's most common among young children. Symptoms usually clear without medication. (Photo Credit: Rasika Pereira/Medical Images) Hand, foot, and mouth disease is not the same as foot-and-mouth disease, which comes from a different virus and affects only animals. HFMD is most commonly caused by coxsackievirus A16 and enterovirus A71. Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease vs. Monkeypox Mpox (formerly called monkeypox) and HFMD have similar signs and symptoms, sometimes making it difficult to tell the two apart. Both can cause flu-like symptoms and sores or blisters on the hands, feet, and mouth. The incubation period is longer for mpox, with symptoms often appearing 1-2 weeks after infection. Mpox is caused by the monkeypox virus, part of the same family of viruses that causes smallpox. Mpox symptoms can mimic smallpox but are milder and rarely fatal. Mpox can be spread easily through human-to-human contact and also by animals. Mpox isn't related to chickenpox. HFMD and mpox can spread to anyone through close contact. The spread of mpox is also associated with intimate contact, including oral, anal, or vaginal sex and touching the genitals. Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease Causes The viruses that usually cause HFMD belong to a group of non-polio enteroviruses. Some include: Coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16). An infection from this virus is the most common cause of HFMD in the U.S. Coxsackievirus A6 (CVA6). This virus was tied to a large outbreak in the U.S. in 2012, and symptoms were more serious than usual. CVA6 outbreaks have also occurred in other countries including Finland and Vietnam. Enterovirus 71 (EV-A71). This virus is a common cause of HFMD worldwide, including outbreaks in East and Southeast Asia. EV-A71 has been associated with more serious diseases such as encephalitis (swelling of the brain). Anyone can have HFMD, but children under the age of 5 are most likely to get it. It tends to spread easily in the summer and fall. Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease Risk Factors The main risk factor for HFMD is age. Infants and children younger than ages 5-7 years are most likely to get the disease. HFMD commonly spreads quickly among children in day-care settings and schools where there is close person-to-person contact. HFMD is transmitted by fecal-oral, oral-oral, and respiratory droplet contact. It’s a more seasonal disease, spreading often in the summer and fall months in the U.S. Older children and adults can get the disease, and it's possible to get HFMD multiple times. Adults with weakened immune systems also are at risk of developing HFMD. Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease in Adults Hand, foot, and mouth disease is much more common in younger children, but it can also affect adults. Children typically show at least some symptoms of HFMD, while adults may not have any noticeable symptoms at all, or their symptoms may be incorrectly diagnosed. HFMD is contagious among all ages, so good hygiene (such as washing your hands) is key to preventing the disease. Stages of Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease HFMD symptoms typically appear in two stages. When the illness first starts, children might experience flu-like symptoms, including a mild fever, sore throat, runny nose, stomachache, or loss of appetite. In a couple of days, those symptoms may be replaced by an itchy rash on the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, elbows, knees, or even genitals or buttocks. Painful sores can develop in and around the mouth and tongue, accompanied by swollen lymph nodes in the neck. Sores may appear as bright pink spots or tiny bumps, and then turn into blisters. In the second stage of a hand, foot, and mouth infection, a rash and blisters may appear on your hands. (Photo Credit: Science Photo Library / Science Source) Symptoms of HFMD will generally clear in 7-10 days, but children under the age of 2 can take longer to clear the virus. Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease Symptoms Early symptoms may include: Fever Sore throat Painful blisters inside a child’s mouth, usually toward the back, or on their tongue Feeling unwell ( malaise ) Loss of appetite Fatigue Crankiness A day or two later, a child might have: A rash that turns into blisters Flat spots or sores on their knees, elbows, or buttocks Blisters on a young child's feet are a common sign of hand, foot, and mouth disease. (Photo Credit: Science Photo Library / Science Source) Mouth sores can make it hurt to swallow. Eating or drinking less than usual could be the only sign of a child’s illness. Be sure they get enough fluids and nutrients. Sores in the mouth from HFMD can be painful. (Photo Credit: Science Photo Library / Science Source) Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease Transmission The viruses that cause HFMD are present in the fluids of an infected person’s body, including: Saliva Mucus from their nose or lungs Fluid from blisters or scabs Poop Hand, foot, and mouth disease spreads through: Coughing or sneezing Close contact such as kissing, hugging, sharing cups, or sharing utensils Contact with poop, like when changing a diaper Touching surfaces with the virus on them Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease Diagnosis Your doctor will ask about your or your child’s symptoms and look at any sores or rashes. This is usually enough for them to decide if it’s hand, foot, and mouth disease. But they might also swab your child’s throat or take a sample of poop or blood for lab testing. Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease Treatment There’s no cure or vaccine for hand, foot, and mouth disease. Because a virus causes it, antibiotics won’t help. It usually goes away on its own after 7-10 days. In the meantime, you can ease symptoms with: Over-the-counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen or numbing mouth sprays. Don’t use aspirin , because it can cause serious illness in children. Cold treats such as ice pops, yogurt, or smoothies to soothe a sore throat . Avoid juice and soda, which have acids that might irritate sores. Anti- itch lotion, such as calamine , for rashes. Hand, Foot, and Mouth Recovery Signs While there is no specific medical treatment for HFMD, most people get better on their own in 7-10 days. Fever may last 2 or 3 days, and mouth sores should go away by day 7. Rashes on the hands and feet may take as long as 10 days to stop, but peeling may continue past that point. Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease Complications Serious complications from hand, foot, and mouth disease are rare. Enterovirus 71 is more likely to cause problems than other HFMD viruses. Complications may include: Dehydration if mouth sores make it hard to swallow liquids Swelling of the membranes around the brain and spinal cord ( viral meningitis ) Brain swelling ( encephalitis ) Swelling of the heart muscle ( myocarditis ) Paralysis Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease Prevention Your child is most contagious in the first 7 days of the illness. But the virus can stay in their body for days or weeks and spread through their spit or poop. Take these steps to lower the chance of infection: Wash your hands carefully, especially after changing a diaper or wiping a child’s nose. Help your children keep their hands clean. Teach kids to cover their mouth and nose when they sneeze or cough. A tissue is best, but the sleeve of their shirt also works. Clean and disinfect surfaces and shared items such as toys and doorknobs. Don’t hug or kiss someone who has hand, foot, and mouth disease. Don’t share cups or utensils with them. Don’t send your child to school or day care until their symptoms are gone. Check with your doctor if you think they might still be contagious. Hand, Foot, and Mouth Quarantine Period Generally, isolation and quarantine can be tough to pull off since the virus can shed for weeks, and some people with hand, foot, and mouth will show no symptoms at all. If you or a family member has HFMD, try the following to limit the spread: During the first week of illness, try to limit family member contact with the sick person in your home, but this may be challenging for parents, siblings, and young children. Keep children with hand, foot, and mouth disease out of childcare or school until their fever is gone and mouth sores have healed. If you have the illness, stay home and limit your contact with others. Most of the time, children recover well from the virus. Not all children have pain, and the rash needs no treatment. Rashes from HFMD usually clear up in 1-2 weeks, but it's not necessary for children to stay home until the rash is gone. Takeaways HFMD is a highly contagious virus that usually strikes infants and young children, but it can impact adults, especially those with weakened immune systems. Initial symptoms include fever, sore throat, and other flu-like symptoms. Typically, sores develop in the mouth, and blisters and a rash can develop across the body from the palms of hands and the soles of feet to the buttocks and genitals. You are most contagious in the first 7 days of the illness. The virus rarely results in serious complications and clears on its own in 1-2 weeks. Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease FAQs What can mimic hand, foot, and mouth disease? HFMD can be mistaken for other viruses and illnesses, including chickenpox, mpox (monkeypox), and even insect bites or herpes. How long is hand, foot, and mouth disease contagious? You are most contagious during the first week of illness, but people can still spread the virus to others for days or weeks after symptoms go away, or even if they have no symptoms at all. How common is it for adults to get hand, foot, and mouth disease? HFMD mostly affects infants and young children, but adults can catch the disease, especially if they have a weakened immune system. Adults also are more likely to show no symptoms of the disease at all, but can still be contagious."
7,Common Cold Prevention,"If you want to craft a battle plan to prevent colds, you don't have to think long and hard about it. Just remember three simple words: Wash your hands ! There's no secret in why that works. It's all due to the way colds spread. How You Get Infected The main way colds get passed around is when someone who's sick coughs or sneezes. Little droplets with germs land on places like doorknobs, telephones, and computer keyboards. Or the sick person coughs or sneezes into their hands and then touches those objects. Then you come along, happy and healthy, and touch that spot. Next, without even realizing it, you might touch your nose and mouth . Voila! In an instant you're infected. Why Hand Washing Works Some viruses -- tiny living things that cause colds -- can live on surfaces for hours. Regular hand washing is your best strategy to keep them from getting inside your body. And of course, if you're the one who's sick, washing up will keep you from spreading your germs. There's some evidence behind this. A program called Operation Stop Cough was started at a military recruit training command center in Illinois. As part of the program, recruits were told to wash their hands at least five times a day. After 2 years, the hand-washing team reported 45% fewer cases of respiratory illness, compared with sickness rates among recruits during the year before the program started. How Should I Wash My Hands for Cold Prevention? Many of us get so busy, we simply forget to wash our hands the right way. Here's the drill: First, wet your hands with water. Then add soap. Rub them together vigorously for 20 seconds. Make sure to rub the wrists, between the fingers, and under the fingernails . When you have time, use a nailbrush, as germs often hide under nails. Rinse your hands thoroughly and dry with a clean paper towel or air dryer. If you are in a public restroom, shut the faucet off with a paper towel. Try to push the door open with your shoulder , or use another paper towel to turn the knob. How Much Hand Washing Is Enough to Prevent Colds? You should wash hands often throughout the day. For example, do it before and after you eat, after using the bathroom, after school, and after handling any raw meat, unwashed vegetables, or garbage. Also wash your hands after coughing , sneezing , blowing your nose, or touching your pet. If you're babysitting, wash before and after changing a baby's diapers and before and after feedings. What if I'm Not Near a Sink? Keep an alcohol-based sanitizer for hands if a sink is unavailable. It should be at least 60% alcohol. Rub the entire surface of your hands, fingers, and wrist with the sanitizer until dry. You can use this throughout the day if you're not near a bathroom. Follow up with a thorough hand scrub when you're near a sink to prevent buildup of the sanitizer."
8,What Is Autoimmune Thyroiditis?,"Your thyroid is a small gland in front of your neck that makes hormones that help control just about every organ. When your thyroid hormone levels are too high or too low, your body can't work right. That can affect your energy level, mood, and weight. If your thyroid becomes inflamed, you have thyroiditis . Sometimes it happens because your body makes antibodies that attack your thyroid by mistake. This condition is called autoimmune thyroiditis, chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis, Hashimoto ’s thyroiditis, or Hashimoto’s disease. Causes Doctors don’t fully understand why your immune system misfires this way. It could be set off by a faulty gene, a virus, or something else. Or it could be a combination of causes. Could You Get It? You may be more likely to get autoimmune thyroiditis if you: Are a woman Are middle-aged Have another autoimmune disorder like lupus , type 1 diabetes , or rheumatoid arthritis Are related to someone who has autoimmune thyroiditis Have been exposed to environmental radiation Symptoms You may not have any in the beginning. As the disease goes on, your thyroid may become enlarged, a condition called a goiter. The front of your neck will look swollen, and it might make your throat feel full. The thyroid may or may not be tender to the touch. A damaged thyroid can’t do its job, which leads to hypothyroidism -- too little of the thyroid hormones. Symptoms can include: Tiredness Sensitivity to cold Puffy face Trouble pooping Enlarged tongue Pale, dry skin and brittle nails Hair loss Weight gain Muscle aches and joint pain Depression Memory lapse Heavy menstrual bleeding Diagnosis Your doctor will order blood tests to check your thyroid hormone levels. The tests also look for something called thyroperoxidase antibodies. You also might have an ultrasound so your doctor can look at your thyroid, especially if your blood test results aren’t clear. Your doctor might spot the problem through regular blood tests even if you don’t have any symptoms, especially if they’re aware that your family has a history of thyroid problems. Treatment The usual therapy is a prescription medicine called levothyroxine (Levo-T, Levothroid , Levoxyl , Synthroid , Tirosint, Unithroid ). It’s a man-made version of what a healthy thyroid makes. Your doctor will keep an eye on you and may have to adjust your dosage every once in a while. You’ll need to take medicine for the rest of your life. Some foods, like a high-fiber diet or soy products, can mess with levothyroxine. You should also let your doctor know if you take: Iron supplements A cholesterol medicine called cholestyramine ( Locholest , Prevalite , Questran ) Antacids that have aluminum hydroxide An ulcer medicine called sucralfate ( Carafate ) Calcium supplements"
9,"Hashimoto's Thyroiditis: Symptoms, Causes, and Treatment","What Is Hashimoto's Thyroiditis? Also called Hashimoto's disease, Hashimoto's thyroiditis is an autoimmune disease , a disorder in which the body's immune system attacks healthy or normal cells. In people with Hashimoto's, the immune system attacks the thyroid . Located in the front of your neck, the thyroid gland is an organ that makes hormones that control metabolism (how your body uses energy) . So, thyroid hormones affect a lot of things, including your heart rate and how quickly your body uses calories from the foods you eat. If your thyroid doesn't make enough hormones, this can lead to hypothyroidism , a condition in which the thyroid does not make enough hormones for the body's needs. Hashimoto's thyroiditis is named after Hakaru Hashimoto, a Japanese doctor who was the first person to describe the condition in 1912. Causes of Hashimoto's Thyroiditis The exact cause of Hashimoto's is not known, but many factors are believed to play a role. They include: Genes. People who get Hashimoto's often have family members who have thyroid disease or other autoimmune diseases. This suggests genes may play a role in who gets the disease. Germs. A virus or bacteria may cause the immune system to attack itself. Environment. Factors like stress or excessive radiation may play a role. Hashimoto's Thyroiditis Risk Factors Here are some of the things that put you at a greater risk of Hashimoto's disease: Gender. Hashimoto's affects about seven times as many women and people with female anatomy as men and people with male anatomy, suggesting that sex hormones may play a role. Furthermore, some women have thyroid problems during the first year after having a baby . Although it usually goes away, as many as 20% of these women develop Hashimoto's years later. Age. Although it may occur in other age groups, the condition is most common in women aged 30-50 years. Having other autoimmune diseases. Having an autoimmune disease, like rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, or type 1 diabetes, increases your risk of getting Hashimoto's. Excessive iodine. Research suggests certain drugs and too much iodine, a trace element required by your body to make thyroid hormones, may trigger thyroid disease in susceptible people. Radiation exposure. Increased cases of thyroid disease have been reported in people exposed to radiation, including the atomic bombs in Japan, the Chernobyl nuclear accident, and radiation treatment for a form of blood cancer called Hodgkin's disease . Hashimoto's Thyroiditis Symptoms Hashimoto's symptoms may be mild at first or take years to develop. The first sign of the disease is often an enlarged thyroid called a goiter . The goiter may cause the front of your neck to look swollen. A large goiter may make swallowing difficult. Other symptoms of an underactive thyroid due to Hashimoto's may include: Weight gain Fatigue Paleness or puffiness of the face Joint and muscle pain Constipation Inability to get warm Difficulty getting pregnant Hair loss or thinning and brittle hair Irregular or heavy menstrual periods Depression Slowed heart rate Muscle aches and tenderness Problems with memory or concentration Enlarged tongue Because Hashimoto's thyroiditis symptoms may be similar to those of other medical conditions, it is important to see your doctor for a diagnosis. Hashimoto's Thyroiditis Diagnosis Your doctor will check to see if you have a goiter. In addition, your doctor will likely order one or more of the following blood tests: Hashimoto's tests Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH): This test checks a hormone called TSH, which is made by a small gland in the brain called the pituitary gland. When your body doesn't have enough thyroid hormones, the pituitary gland sends out TSH to tell your thyroid to make more hormones. If the TSH level in your blood is high, it means you might have hypothyroidism. Thyroxine (T-4) test: This test measures the main thyroid hormone in your body called T-4. If your blood has too little T-4, it confirms what the TSH test found—the issue is with your thyroid itself. Antibody test: Because other diseases beside Hashimoto's may cause hypothyroidism, the doctor has to order an antibody test to make sure what the cause of the hypothyroidism may be. If the test shows the presence of an antibody to thyroid peroxidase (a protein involved in thyroid hormone production), that's a strong sign that you have Hashimoto's thyroiditis. You might need to do more than one antibody test to confirm a Hashimoto's diagnosis. Hashimoto's Thyroiditis Treatment Hashimoto's disease treatment depends on whether your thyroid is damaged enough to cause hypothyroidism. If you don't have hypothyroidism, or only a very mild case, your doctor might not prescribe any medication but instead just monitor your symptoms and check your thyroid hormone levels. If you have hypothyroidism, you'll be given medicine in the form of a pill, gel capsule, or liquid to take. This medicine, called levothyroxine, is a chemical or synthetic version of the natural thyroid hormone T-4 and is designed to restore your normal metabolism . Levothyroxine is available in several different strengths. The exact dose your doctor prescribes will depend on a number of factors, including: Age Weight Severity of hypothyroidism Other health problems Other medicines that may interact with synthetic thyroid hormones Six to 8 weeks after starting treatment, your doctor will order a TSH test to monitor your thyroid function and ensure you're getting the right dose. Once the dose is correct, the test will be repeated in 6 months and then in a year's time. You'll need to stay on this drug for life as there's no cure for Hashimoto's. Because thyroid hormones act very slowly in the body, it may take a few months for symptoms to go away and your goiter to shrink. However, large goiters that do not improve may make it necessary to remove the thyroid gland. There shouldn't be any side effects with this medication. However, you'll want to avoid taking it with certain foods, supplements, or drinks like grapefruit juice and iron supplements, which might affect how well it is absorbed. Also, if you take too much thyroid hormone, you can develop serious problems like atrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeat) and osteoporosis ( brittle bones) . If the levothyroxine doesn't control all your symptoms of hypothyroidism, your doctor may add a prescription for a synthetic version of another thyroid hormone called T-3 or combine the two hormones together. Dealing With a Hashimoto's Flare-Up Even if you're on hormone medication, you could get a flare-up of Hashimoto's. This could happen while your doctor is trying to work out the correct dose of your medicine or if you're not taking your pills regularly. It could also happen because of a physical or emotional trigger like: Lack of sleep Infection Something lacking in your diet Stressful changes, such as a move, new job, or divorce Anxiety Depression Signs of a flare-up might change from person to person, but you might see any of the following: Fatigue or stress Sleep problems Sensitivity to heat Irritability Rapid heartbeat Here are some things you can do if you experience a flare-up: Make sure you take your thyroid medication every day. Follow an anti-inflammatory diet. This means to eat foods that are nutrient-dense (like fruits, vegetables, nuts, lean meats, and fatty fish like salmon). Avoid processed meats, fried foods, and sodas. Check your iodine level. Iodine is a mineral found in some foods, like iodized salt, seaweed, and processed meats. Your thyroid uses iodine to make thyroid hormones. If you have Hashimoto's, you might be sensitive to iodine. Talk to your doctor about this and try to reduce your iodine level if it is too high. Lower your stress. Because autoimmune diseases are often triggered by stress, take steps to lessen this. Get enough rest and time to relax or be with friends. Talk to your doctor or nutritionist about whether to take vitamin D and selenium. Research on whether these supplements help is mixed. Hashimoto's Thyroiditis Complications If Hashimoto's thyroiditis is not treated, you may experience the following complications: Goiter . Your throat may look like it's got a stuck tennis ball inside it due to your enlarged thyroid. Heart problems. Low levels of thyroid hormones may cause high levels of LDL (bad) cholesterol that increases the risk of heart disease. You may also have an irregular heartbeat and an enlarged heart. Emotional problems. This includes depression. Sexual problems. This includes lack of sex drive, inability to ovulate (eggs not releasing from the ovaries), erectile dysfunction, or low sperm count. Pregnancy problems. If the pregnant mother has untreated Hashimoto's, the risk of a miscarriage or premature birth increases. The baby may also be born with birth defects like a cleft palate, autism, or intellectual disabilities. Myxedema. In very severe but rare cases, you could develop myxedema coma if your body has been exposed to cold, sedatives, or infection and your Hashimoto's has been untreated for a long time. Symptoms include extreme drowsiness, lethargy, and then unconsciousness."
10,Understanding Hay Fever -- the Basics,"What Is Hay Fever? Hay fever is an allergic reaction to certain things. Common triggers include pollen, ragweed, and cats. Also known as allergic rhinitis , there are two types: seasonal, which happens only during the time of year in which certain plants pollinate, and perennial, which happens year-round. Typically, if you suffer from hay fever in the spring, you're probably allergic to tree pollens. Grass and weed pollens may be causing your allergic reaction during the summer. In autumn, ragweed pollen may plague you, and fungus spores cause problems primarily from late March through November but can be present year-round. People with year-round (perennial) hay fever are usually allergic to one or more allergens found indoors. These include house dust mites , feathers, and animal dander (the tiny skin flakes animals such as cats and dogs shed along with fur), all of which may be found in pillows, bedding, heavy draperies, upholstery, and carpeting. Another common allergen, mold , is usually found in damp areas such as bathrooms and basements. What Causes Hay Fever? If you have hay fever (allergic rhinitis), it's because your immune system views harmless inhaled pollen or other allergens as dangerous substances invading the body. Your system overreacts, flooding your bloodstream with chemicals like histamine and leukotrienes. These inflame the lining of your nasal passages, sinuses , and eyelids and also set in motion other symptoms associated with hay fever, such as: Stuffy or runny nose Sneezing Cough Itchy, watery eyes Itchy mouth, throat, or ears Postnasal drip Dark circles under your eyes All of these symptoms are meant to protect your body either by trapping and expelling the allergen or by swelling body areas, such as the nasal passages, so the allergen can't enter. As a result of congestion in the veins in the lining of your sinuses , dark circles, commonly known as allergic shiners, may appear under your eyes . If you have perennial allergic rhinitis, they may be present all year round. The swelling of your nasal membranes may also close the sinus drainage openings, causing sinusitis . Rhinitis may also be associated with nasal polyps -- small, non-cancerous growths. And nosebleeds can occur during hay fever attacks. Hay fever is often an inherited trait (genetically determined). Most people with hay fever have a parent or sibling who also has allergies . People with asthma or eczema (allergic dermatitis ) are more likely than others to develop hay fever; and about one-third of those with allergic rhinitis also have at least mild, intermittent, allergic asthma . When to Get Help See a doctor if: Your allergy symptoms are affecting your quality of life. Your hay fever does not go away. Over-the-counter (OTC) medicines don't help or have unpleasant side effects. You have other problems, like asthma, chronic sinus infections, or polyps in your nose. Many people try to live without treating hay fever, but treatment can help ease your symptoms. Getting help for your symptoms early can put you on the right track for improving your allergies. Do Your Homework Before you see the doctor, think about when and where your symptoms show up.  For example: Tree pollens typically appear in early spring. Grasses shed pollen in late spring and summer. Ragweed makes pollen in the fall. Indoor allergies might get worse in winter. Indoor and outdoor molds, along with pet dander, might trigger symptoms year-round. If your symptoms go away after about a week, you could have a cold and not an allergy. Medications It may take several tries to ease your symptoms. First, you should stay away from triggers as much as you can. Second, you should take the medicines your doctor suggests or prescribes as directed. That will help them work better. Corticosteroid nasal sprays. You can use them long-term to treat symptoms like itching, runny nose, and congestion. They usually provide relief within 12 hours of your first dose. They include budesonide, fluticasone, and mometasone. Antihistamines. These are pills, nose sprays, and eye drops that work best on hay fever symptoms like runny nose, sneezing, and itchy eyes and skin. Options include cetirizine, fexofenadine, and loratadine. These are often preferable to older products (your doctor may call them first-generation antihistamines), which typically cause drowsiness. Decongestants. They help relieve the swelling inside your nose that makes it stuffy. Don't use nose drops and sprays longer than 5 days. Your nose gets used to them and congestion returns. Your doctor may call this rebound swelling. Cromolyn sodium. Use this OTC nasal spray several times a day to stop the release of histamines. It works best when you start before symptoms show up. Leukotriene modifier. This medicine hinders leukotrienes, chemicals in your immune system that cause your body to make extra mucus.  A leukotriene modifier like montelukast can help when allergy symptoms come with mild asthma. Nasal ipratropium. This prescription nose spray helps stop an extra-runny nose but doesn't do much for symptoms like congestion or sneezing. Don't take it if you've been diagnosed with glaucoma or an enlarged prostate gland. Immunotherapy This treatment aims to make your body less reactive. It doesn't work for every allergen. It seems to help most with common environmental triggers. The first step is to find out what you're allergic to. Your doctor will do this with a skin prick test or by injecting small doses of the allergen under your skin. When you react, you're allergic to that substance. After that, you'll get shots with small doses of the things you're allergic to -- usually one at a time. Your doctor will slowly increase the dose until you get to the largest amount you can tolerate. You must visit your doctor regularly, often weekly, for as many as 2 to 5 years. In 2014, the FDA approved sublingual immunotherapy for treatment of grass and ragweed pollens. It works by placing a tablet or liquid under the tongue daily. It's best to begin this therapy several months before allergy season begins. Stay Away From Triggers You can ease your allergy symptoms by avoiding or reducing your exposure to triggers. For seasonal allergies, you should: Stay indoors as much as possible during peak pollen counts and windy days. Ragweed is highest in the morning. Tree and grass pollens peak in the early evening. Close windows and use your air conditioner. Wear glasses or sunglasses to keep pollen out of your eyes. Wear a mask when you work outdoors. For perennial allergies to indoor animals and pests: Use dust mite-proof covers for pillows and mattresses. Wash your sheets and blankets often in hot water. Keep humidity levels down in your home with dehumidifiers and air conditioning. Wash your hands after you touch animals. Keep your pet out of your bedroom while you sleep. Replace carpets with hardwood, tile, or linoleum flooring. Use a HEPA filter on your HVAC system and your vacuum. Saline rinses. They can ease nasal congestion and wash allergens and extra mucus out of your nose. You can use a premixed solution in a squeeze bottle or a neti pot. Use distilled, sterile, or boiled water if you decide to make the saline mixture yourself. Use purified water to rinse and sterilize the bottle or neti pot after each use. Let them air dry. Bioelectronic sinus device. This works by using microcurrents to stimulate nerve fibers in your sinuses. Sold over-the-counter, it helps reduce sinus inflammation, pain, and congestion. Herbal remedies. There's some evidence that a shrub called butterbur may help hay fever symptoms. The raw plant can be toxic. Choose a product labeled “PA-free.” Other herbal remedies include capsicum, honey, vitamin C, and fish oil, but more research is needed to know how well they work.  Some people use acupuncture to treat hay fever. Although there's no cure for hay fever, if you work with your doctor, stick to your treatment plan, and avoid the triggers for your seasonal and perennial allergies, you can manage your symptoms before they manage you."
11,Huntington's Disease,"What is Huntington's Disease? Huntington's disease (HD) is a hereditary and deadly disorder that causes nerve cells in the brain to break down. This causes physical and mental abilities to weaken, and they get worse over time. There is no cure. If it starts early in life, it’s called juvenile Huntington’s disease. A diagnosis of Huntington's disease may come as quite a shock. There's a lot to take in. But tapping into a support system, such as a social worker, therapist, or support group, can make the journey a bit less daunting. With the help of a healthcare team, people with Huntington's can live independently for many years. Symptoms of Huntington's Disease Although symptoms may first show up in midlife, Huntington's can strike anyone from childhood to advanced age. Symptoms often first appear when people are in their 30s or 40s. Over 10 to 25 years, the disease gradually kills nerve cells in the brain . This affects the body, mind, and emotions. If symptoms begin before age 20, it’s called juvenile Huntington’s Disease and it may get worse faster. Symptoms can vary greatly from person to person. And stress or excitement can worsen symptoms. Some symptoms are easier to spot than others. Abnormal movements may be the first thing you notice. Weight loss can be a concern at all stages. Symptoms of Huntington's disease tend to develop in stages. Early stage symptoms Changes may be quite subtle in the early stages, making it possible to keep driving and working. You may just require a little extra help. Common early symptoms include: Trouble learning new things Trouble making decisions Memory lapses Mood swings Clumsiness Slow or abnormal eye movements Muscle problems (dystonia) Trouble sleeping (insomnia) Loss of energy and fatigue Middle stage symptoms With time, symptoms begin to interfere more with your day-to-day life. For example, you might start to drop things or to fall. Or you may have trouble speaking or swallowing. Staying organized may be difficult. And emotional changes may put pressure on relationships . Common middle stage symptoms include: Uncontrolled twitching movements (chorea) Trouble walking Confusion Memory loss Personality changes Speech changes Decline in thinking abilities Swallowing problems Breathing problems Thoughts of death, dying, or suicide Weight loss Development of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), bipolar disorder, or mania Late stage symptoms In this stage, people with Huntington's must depend on others for their care. Walking and speaking are not possible Most likely you will still be aware of loved ones around you. Fidgety movements may become severe or may subside. Juvenile Huntington’s disease symptoms In children or teens , Huntington's may progress more quickly and cause symptoms like: Stiff or awkward walking Increased clumsiness Changes in speech Trouble paying attention Sudden drop in school performance Behavior problems Tremors Seizures Diagnosing Huntington's Disease Family history plays a major role in a diagnosis. Your doctor will ask you questions about your medical background and give you a physical exam. If you and your doctor suspect Huntington’s disease, a neurologist will conduct more tests. A neurologist may test: Reflexes Muscle strength Balance Sense of touch Vision Hearing Mood and mental status Memory Reasoning Thinking skills Speech Treatment and Home Remedies for Huntington's Disease For now, treating Huntington's involves managing symptoms: Medications can help control fidgety movements. Your doctor can work closely with you to manage any side effects and to change medications if needed. Some antipsychotic drugs have a side effect that controls movement and have been helpful for some people. Antidepressants can also help with obsessive-compulsive disorder. Mood-stabilizing drugs can ease symptoms of mood disorders but may cause other side effects. Speech or language therapy may be helpful for any problems with speech or swallowing. Occupational or physical therapy may help you learn how to better control movements. And assistive devices such as handrails can help you manage your changing physical abilities. Nutritional support ranges from using special utensils to focusing on nutrient-dense foods to supplementing with tube feeding in later stages. Exercise may be very helpful. People with Huntington's who stay as fit and active as they can seem to do better than those who do not. Psychotherapy can teach you ways to manage changes in your emotions and how you think.  Strategies like breaking tasks into simpler steps may go a long way toward making these changes a bit easier for you and your family. Family members can help by making some changes at home: Serve extra meals and add high-calorie supplements to help you stay at a healthy weight. Limit distractions during meal times. Choose foods that are easier to chew and swallow. Use forks and other utensils made for people with limited motor skills. Use covered cups with straws or drinking spouts. Keep a regular routine. Use phone or computer reminders for tasks. Keep life as calm, simple, and low-stress as possible. For children, work with the school counselor to make an education plan. See friends and maintain social interactions as much as possible. Add wheelchair ramps and elevators to the home if possible. Add safety bars in bathrooms, next to the bed, and on stairs. Use voice-controlled lights and other “smart” home features. Use electronic speech programs or picture charts to aid communication. Causes of Huntington's Disease In 1993, researchers found the gene that causes Huntington's. Everyone has the HD gene, but in some families an abnormal copy of the gene gets passed from parent to child. If you have a parent with Huntington's disease, you have a 50% chance of having the gene and developing the disease. Also: Men and women are equally likely to inherit the abnormal gene. If you don't have the abnormal gene, you can't get Huntington's or pass it on to your children. The disease doesn't skip generations. If you or members of your family plan to be tested for Huntington's, it's a good idea to get professional genetic counseling first. Counselors can help explain what to expect from the test results. With knowledge about the HD gene, scientists have been able to learn a great deal about how the disease affects the brain . More importantly, this discovery may help pave the way for future treatment."
12,Tension Headaches,"What Are Tension Headaches? Tension headaches are dull pain, tightness, or pressure that can feel like a clamp squeezing your skull. They’re also called stress headaches, and they’re the most common type for adults . There are two types: Episodic tension headaches happen fewer than 15 days per month. Chronic tension headaches happen more than 15 days a month. These headaches can last 30 minutes to a few days. The episodic kind usually starts slowly, often in the middle of the day. Chronic ones come and go over a longer period of time. The pain may get stronger or ease up through the day, but it’s almost always there. Although your head hurts, tension headaches usually don't keep you from your daily activities, and they don’t affect your vision, balance, or strength. Where does it hurt? This type of headache can: Start at in one area of your head and spread Become a band of dull pressure or squeezing pain around your entire head Affect both sides of your head equally Make the muscles in your neck, shoulders, and jaw feel tight and sore Tension Headache Symptoms Common symptoms include: Mild to moderate pain or pressure in the front, top, or sides of your head A headache that starts later in the day Feeling very tired Crankiness Trouble focusing Mild sensitivity to light or noise Muscle aches Unlike with migraine headaches, you won’t have other nerve symptoms, such as muscle weakness or blurred vision. And tension headaches don’t usually cause severe sensitivity to light or noise, stomach pain, nausea, or vomiting. Tension Headache Causes There's no single cause of tension headaches. They don’t run in families. Some people get them because of tight muscles in the back of the neck and scalp. Tension headache triggers Most of the time, tension headaches are triggered by stress from work, school, family, friends, or other relationships. Episodic ones are usually set off by a single stressful situation or a buildup of stress. Daily stress can lead to the chronic kind. Tension headache triggers may include: Not enough rest Poor posture Emotional or mental stress, including depression Anxiety Fatigue Hunger Low iron levels Alcohol Jaw or dental problems Straining your eyes Dehydration Skipping meals Smoking A cold, the flu, or a sinus infection Tension Headache Risk Factors Up to 80% of adults in the U.S. get them from time to time. About 3% have chronic daily tension headaches. Women are twice as likely to get them as men. Most people with episodic tension headaches have them no more than once or twice a month, but they can happen more often. Many people with the chronic type have usually had them for more than 60 to 90 days. When to See Your Doctor See your doctor if you have frequent or severe headaches , or if they get in the way of your daily life. Call 911 for a headache that is sudden and severe or also makes your face droop, causes weakness or numbness, or makes it hard to talk, see, or think. Tension Headache Diagnosis Your doctor may diagnose you based only on your symptoms. They might ask you things like: Where does your head hurt? What does the pain feel like? When do you have headaches? How long do they last? Do your headaches get in the way of your daily life? Do they keep you from sleeping? Are you under a lot of stress? Have you had a head injury? Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or personality? They can also do tests to rule out other conditions. These include: Blood tests Imaging tests such as X-rays, CT scans , or MRI exams to make pictures of the inside of your head Tension Headache Treatment It’s best to treat tension headaches soon after they begin, when the symptoms are still mild. The goal is to ease your pain and prevent more of them from happening. Medications Over-the-counter (OTC) painkillers are often the first treatments for tension headaches. People with the chronic kind can use some of these drugs to prevent headaches. But if you take them a lot, they can lead to what’s called a medication overuse or rebound headache . Common OTC treatments include: Acetaminophen Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen If OTC pain relievers don't help, your doctor may prescribe a stronger medicine such as: Indomethacin (Indocin, Indochron E-R) Ketoprofen Ketorolac (Toradol) Naproxen (Naprelan, Naprosyn) They could also recommend a muscle relaxer like: Cyclobenzaprine (Amrix, Fexmid) Methocarbamol (Robaxin) Some other kinds of drugs can keep you from getting a tension headache. You take them every day, even if you aren’t in pain, so that you end up using less medication over time. Your doctor may prescribe: Tricyclic antidepressants like amitriptyline and protriptyline Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) including fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), or venlafaxine (Effexor) Anti-seizure drugs such as topiramate (Topamax) Keep in mind that medications don't cure headaches and that, over time, pain relievers and other medicines might not help as much as they did at first. Plus, all medicines have side effects. If you take one regularly, talk with your doctor about the pros and cons. You'll still need to identify and deal with the things that are causing your headaches. Supplements Some studies have found that certain dietary supplements are effective against migraine headaches. They may also help prevent tension headaches. These supplements include: Butterbur Feverfew Riboflavin Coenzyme Q10 Talk with your doctor before starting any supplements. Tension Headache Prevention Try these treatments to make your headaches less severe or less frequent. Find ways to relax and manage stress like: Biofeedback Cognitive behavioral therapy Acupuncture Massage therapy Physical therapy Deep breathing Meditation Yoga Hypnotherapy Lifestyle changes may also help. Consider these: Limit stress. Try to plan. Get, and stay, organized. Things that help you relax, like massage or meditation, can also help. Try to pace yourself. Take breaks. Carve out time to do things you enjoy. For some people, mindfulness – staying in the here and now, instead of following thoughts of worry and fear – can help. Build your support system. Spend time with people you love. You may also want to book some sessions with a therapist to find solutions and to manage any anxiety or depression you may have. Exercise regularly. At least 30 minutes five times a week is ideal. It eases stress and keeps you fit. It also helps to stretch. Pay close attention to your jaw, neck, and shoulders. These are areas where we tend to hold a lot of tension. Get enough sleep. When you’re well-rested, it’s much easier to deal with daily stress . Improve your posture. A strong stance can help keep your muscles from tensing. When you stand, hold your shoulders back and your head level. Tighten your belly and buttocks. When you sit, make sure your thighs are parallel to the floor and your head and neck don’t slump forward. Drink lots of water. If you’re dehydrated, you’re more likely to get a tension headache. Drink several glasses of fresh water each day, even if you’re not thirsty. It also helps to eat foods that are naturally rich in water, like most fruits and vegetables. Eat regular, balanced meals. Skipping a meal can cause a throbbing headache. Try to eat at the same times every day. Include plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains in your diet. Limit caffeine and alcohol. There is caffeine in many over-the-counter headache medicines, but it can also trigger headaches. Drink less coffee and tea, and fewer energy and soft drinks. Limit how much pain-relieving medication you take. Use the smallest possible dose. Don't take painkillers more than one or two times a week. Keep your sense of humor. It reduces tension. Use a headache diary. This will help you spot triggers. It’ll also help your doctor come up with a treatment plan. When you get a headache, note things like the date, the time, any warning signs or other symptoms, the location and intensity of the pain, what you were doing, medications you’d taken, and food you had eaten. Tension Headaches vs. Migraines How do you tell them apart? Tension headaches: What do they feel like? Steady, mild to moderate pain that doesn’t throb. It can ease or get worse over the course of the headache. Where do they hurt? It can hurt all over your head, but you’ll most likely feel a band of pain around your forehead or the base of your skull or around your neck. The headache does not get worse with activity. Your jaw, shoulders, neck, and head may also be tender. Are there any other symptoms? This type of headache doesn’t come with the nausea, vomiting, light sensitivity, or aura that people with migraines have. Do you notice symptoms before the headache starts? You might feel stress or tension. Who gets them? Mostly adults. How often do you get them? It varies. How long do they last? Thirty minutes to 7 days. Migraines: What do they feel like? They come on slowly. The pain becomes intense. It can be moderate or severe. It might throb or pulse, and it will get worse with physical activity. Where do they hurt? Often, it’s only one side of your head. It might affect your eye, temple, or the base of your skull. Are there other symptoms? Some people get a visual disturbance called an aura before the headache starts. During the headache, you might be extra sensitive to light and sound. You might get nauseated and throw up. Some people have trouble moving or speaking. Who gets them? Anyone. Boys get them more than girls before puberty But afterward, women get them more than men. How often do you get them? It varies. How long do they last? Between 4 and 72 hours."
13,Pain Management: Alternative Therapy,"The term ''alternative therapy'' generally is used to describe any medical treatment or intervention that is used in place of conventional medicine. When alternative therapies are used in conjunction with conventional medicine, it is called complementary medicine . Alternative therapy encompasses a variety of disciplines, including acupuncture , guided imagery, chiropractic treatment, yoga , hypnosis, biofeedback , aromatherapy, relaxation, herbal remedies, massage , and many others. In the past decade, strong evidence has been gathered for the benefits of mind-body therapies, acupuncture , and some nutritional supplements for treating pain . Other alternative therapies such as massage, chiropractic therapies, therapeutic touch, certain herbal therapies, and dietary approaches have the potential to alleviate pain in some cases. More research is needed to see how these therapies compare to conventional treatments. Mind-Body Therapies Mind-body therapies are treatments that are meant to help the mind’s ability to affect the functions and symptoms of the body. Mind-body therapies use various approaches, including relaxation techniques, meditation, guided imagery, biofeedback, and hypnosis. Relaxation techniques can help alleviate discomfort related to chronic pain . Visualization, also known as guided visualization, may be another worthwhile pain-controlling technique. Try the following exercise: Close your eyes and try to call up a visual image of the pain, giving it shape, color, size, motion. Now try slowly altering this image, replacing it with a more harmonious, pleasing -- and smaller -- image. Another approach is to keep a diary of your pain episodes and the causative and corrective factors surrounding them. Review your diary regularly to explore avenues of possible change. Strive to view pain as part of life, not all of it. Electromyographic (EMG) biofeedback may alert you to the ways in which muscle tension is contributing to your pain and help you learn to control it. Hypnotherapy and self-hypnosis may help you block or transform pain through refocusing techniques. One self-hypnosis strategy, known as glove anesthesia, involves putting yourself in a trance, placing a hand over the painful area, imagining that the hand is relaxed, heavy, and numb, and envisioning these sensations as replacing other, painful feelings in the affected area. Relaxation techniques such as meditation or yoga have been shown to reduce stress-related pain when they are practiced regularly. The gentle stretching of yoga is particularly good for strengthening muscles without putting additional strain on the body. Acupuncture Although the World Health Organization currently recognizes more than 30 diseases or conditions that can be helped by acupuncture treatment, one of the main uses of acupuncture is for pain relief. Sixteenth-century Chinese doctors believed that illness was due to an imbalance of energy in the body. In acupuncture, disposable, stainless steel needles are used to stimulate the body's 14 major meridians, or energy-carrying channels, to resist or overcome illnesses and conditions by correcting these imbalances. Acupuncture is also thought to decrease pain by increasing the release of chemicals that block pain, called endorphins. Many acu-points are near nerves. When stimulated, these nerves cause a dull ache or feeling of fullness in the muscle. The stimulated muscle sends a message to the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord), causing the release of endorphins ( morphine -like chemicals produced in our own bodies during times of pain or stress). Endorphins, along with other neurotransmitters (body chemicals that modify nerve impulses), block the message of pain from being delivered up to the brain . Acupuncture may be useful as an accompanying treatment for many pain-related conditions, including: headache, low back pain, menstrual cramps , carpal tunnel syndrome, tennis elbow , fibromyalgia, osteoarthritis and myofascial pain. Acupuncture also may be an acceptable alternative to or may be included as part of a comprehensive pain management program. Chiropractic Treatment and Massage Chiropractic treatment is the most common nonsurgical treatment for back pain. Improvements in people undergoing chiropractic manipulations were noted in some trials. However, the treatment's effectiveness in treating chronic back and neck pain isn’t supported by compelling evidence from the majority of clinical trials . Further studies are currently assessing the effectiveness of chiropractic care for pain management . Research also suggests that chiropractic treatments may be helpful for headaches, neck pain , certain arm and leg conditions, and whiplash . Serious complications such as stroke, pinched nerves, and worsening of herniated discs have been rarely reported. Massage is being increasingly used by people suffering from pain, mostly to manage chronic back and neck problems. Massage can reduce stress and relieve tension by enhancing blood flow. This treatment also can reduce the presence of substances that may generate and sustain pain. Available data suggest that massage therapy, like chiropractic manipulations, holds considerable promise for managing back pain. But it’s not possible to draw final conclusions regarding the effectiveness of massage to treat pain because of the shortcomings of available studies. Therapeutic Touch and Reiki Healing Therapeutic touch and reiki healing are thought to help activate the self-healing processes of an individual and therefore reduce pain. Although these so called ""energy-based"" techniques do not require actual physical contact, they do involve close physical proximity between practitioner and patient. In the past few years, several reviews evaluated published studies on the efficacy of these healing approaches to ease pain and anxiety and improve health. Although a few small studies showed these techniques are beneficial and have no significant adverse side effects, the limitations of some of these studies make it difficult to draw definitive conclusions. Further studies are needed before the evidence-based recommendation for using these approaches for pain treatment can be made. Dietary Approaches to Treating Pain Some people believe that changing dietary fat intake and/or consuming plant foods that contain anti-inflammatory agents can help ease pain by limiting inflammation . A mostly raw vegetarian diet was found helpful for some people with fibromyalgia, but this study was not randomized and was without a control group. One study of women with premenstrual symptoms suggested that a low-fat vegetarian diet was associated with decreased pain intensity and duration. Weight loss achieved by a combination of dietary changes and increased physical activity has been shown to be helpful for people suffering from osteoarthritis. Still, further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of dietary modifications as a pain treatment. Nutritional Supplements There is some evidence indicating that glucosamine sulfate and chondroitin sulfate may be marginally effective for knee osteoarthritis , but other studies have found no benefit at all. These natural compounds were found to be well-tolerated and safe. Other dietary supplements , such as fish oils, also showed some early evidence of benefit, although more research is needed. Herbal Remedies It has been difficult to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of herbs. If you decide to use herbal preparations to better manage your pain, it is of critical importance to share this information with your doctor. Some herbs may interact with drugs you are receiving for pain or other conditions and may harm your health. Things to Consider Alternative therapies are not always benign. As mentioned, some herbal therapies can interact with other medications you may be taking. Always talk to your doctor before trying an alternative approach and be sure to tell all your doctors what alternative treatments you are using."
14,Baby Safety,"Your child's safety is your responsibility. The following tips should help you keep your baby out of harm's way from birth through their toddler years. Baby Safety in the Car Always use a federally approved car safety seat when traveling in a motor vehicle. Carefully read safety seat instructions, as well as instructions in your car's owner's manual, to ensure that the seat has been properly installed. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends buying a new car seat unless you’re sure a used seat has never been in an accident. NEVER carry your infant in your lap while you ride in a car. For the first 2 years of a baby's life, car seats should face the rear of the vehicle. The safest location for the car seat is the middle of the back seat. NEVER put the baby in the front passenger seat of cars, especially those with airbags. If you have a truck with no back seat, you should disengage the airbag while the baby's seat is in the car. Check the height and weight limits on your child’s car seat from time to time to be sure they haven’t outgrown it. You’ll also need to adjust the position of the harness straps as your baby gets bigger. If you have questions about safety seats, call the Auto Safety Hotline at 888-327-4236 (888-DASH-2-DOT). Or visit an NHTSA car seat inspection station . Often, they're located at fire stations. A certified technician will show you how to properly install and use your car seat. To minimize the risk that a child will accidentally be left behind in a car or get trapped inside: Leave a purse, briefcase, shoe, or cell phone in the back seat. That way, you get in the habit of checking in the back seat before leaving the vehicle. Make an arrangement with your child’s day care to have them call you if the child doesn’t show up as expected. Always lock your car and car trunk, even if the car is parked in the driveway at home, and always keep keys out of the reach of little ones. Preventing Baby Falls If you use an infant carrier, always place it on the floor, never on a counter or tabletop. Make sure the baby is always strapped in. Never leave your baby alone on a bed, couch, changing table, or infant seat from which they can fall or roll off. Even if looking away for a second, an accident can happen. Baby Safety, Smoking and Fire Safety Do not smoke and do not allow smoking around your baby. Even smoking “outside” is harmful for the baby because clothing, hair and skin still carry smoke particles. Install a working smoke alarm on every level of your home. Change the batteries of your smoke detectors every 6 months. Have at least one fire extinguisher on every level of your home. If your home uses gas heat, install a carbon monoxide detector. Preventing Baby Burns Do not hold hot liquids while holding your baby. To prevent burns, do not microwave your baby's bottle. Many microwaves heat unevenly, creating ""hot spots"" in your baby's formula that can burn your baby's mouth. Instead, warm the formula by running warm tap water over the bottle or submerging the bottle in a bowl of warm water. Shake the bottle well. Make sure you test the temperature on your hand or wrist before feeding it to your baby. Keep your hot water heater's thermostat at no higher than 120 degrees F. Consider installing anti-scald devices on faucets and shower heads. Preventing Baby Accidents Keep sharp objects (knives, scissors, tools, razors) and other hazardous items (coins, glass objects, beads, pins, medications ) in a secure place out of your baby's reach. NEVER shake a baby or throw your baby in the air. This can cause brain damage or blindness. Do not leave your baby alone with a young sibling or a pet, even when your baby is sleeping. Never put your child in a walker. They send thousands of kids to the emergency room every year, mainly by causing falls down stairs. Make sure that your baby cannot pull lamps or other electrical objects on top of themselves. Use electrical tape to secure electrical cords along baseboards. Remove tablecloths that can be pulled from the table. Make sure all drawers have stops so that your baby or toddler can't pull the drawer out on top of themselves. Attach furniture to the wall so the pieces don’t fall over the child. Avoid electronics on top of higher dressers or tables that can fall on the child. Baby Bathing Safety Always test the bath water to make sure it is not too hot before setting your baby in the water. Dipping your elbow in the water is a good way to test. Turn down your water heater to 120 F. Never leave your baby unattended in the bathtub or bath ring. It only takes a few seconds for a baby to drown. Store small appliances, such as hair dryers and radios, away from the water and bathing areas. Keep these appliances unplugged and out of reach when not in use. Baby Toy Safety Inspect your child's toys often. Be sure that toys are unbreakable, do not come apart, do not have small parts that could be chewed or broken off, and are not sharp. The pieces/toys should be larger than your baby's mouth . Use toy chests without lids or with supports that hold a lid open in any position. Be cautious with balloons to prevent choking. Baby Choking or Strangulation Prevention NEVER put strings or cords around your baby's neck (such as to hold a pacifier ) or near your baby's crib. Be cautious of strings or buttons on clothing; make sure they are not in danger of choking your baby. Secure cords on blinds and drapes out of reach to prevent accidental strangulation. Put away small objects -- even display items -- that can cause injury or choking if swallowed. Baby Feeding Safety Never prop up your baby's bottle and leave your baby unattended; your baby could choke. Do not put your baby to bed with a bottle. Avoid giving your child raw carrots, unpeeled apples, nuts, hard candies, and other foods that present a choking hazard. In a highchair, always use restraining straps that run around your child's waist and between their legs to keep them from sliding out. Baby Sleeping Safety All infants should be put down for sleep on their backs to reduce the risk for sudden infant death syndrome, also called SIDS. Give your baby a pacifier before they go to sleep . This reduces the chance of SIDS. Avoid soft bedding that might suffocate your baby, such as pillows, blankets, plush toys, and bumpers in the crib. Crib slats should be 2 3/8 inches apart or less so the baby’s head can't get trapped. Keep your baby's room at a moderate temperature and dress them in a way that they can't overheat. This also reduces the risk of SIDS. Share a bedroom with your newborn -- but not a bed. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that parents sleep in the same room, preferably for at least the first six months. Avoid devices marketed to reduce the risk of SIDS, such as sleep positioners. Nursing your baby and making sure that your baby gets all of the recommended vaccines can help protect against SIDS. Don’t nurse in a chair or on a couch if you feel you might fall asleep. If your baby falls asleep in a car seat, swing or carrier, try to remove them and lay them on a flat surface. Try to have skin-to-skin contact with your baby. Changing Table Safety Use a sturdy table. Always keep your hands and eyes on your baby while they are on the changing table. Keep supplies within easy reach. Babies and Pets Keep food and water bowls in an area your baby can’t reach. Same with the litterbox. Supervise your child’s interactions with your pets and teach them to be gentle. Hitting or tail-pulling can lead to bites and scratches. Don’t let your animals lick your baby’s face or skin, especially if they have a cut or scrape. Wash your child’s hands after they play with the dog or cat. Keep the pet toys out of your baby’s mouth. Most doctors say pets shouldn’t sleep in your child’s bed. Baby Crawling and Walking Safety When your baby becomes mobile, here are important tips to keep your baby safe around your home: Put electrical outlet covers on all outlets. Secure electrical cords to baseboards. Install safety gates securely in front of stairs and basement doors. Avoid gates with diamond-shaped slats, which provide footholds for climbing toddlers. Instead, use gates with straight, vertical slats, and a swinging door. Use doorknob covers to keep children away from rooms and other areas with hazards. Be careful, though, that these devices are easy for adults to use in case of emergency. Store cleaners and medications out of reach and in a locked cabinet, and always in their original containers. Never store toxic substances in bottles or jars that could be mistaken for food products. Install safety locks on cabinets. Turn pot and pan handles on the stove in and cook on the back burners whenever possible. Establish the area in front of the stove as off-limits while you are cooking. Keep the toilet lid down to prevent drowning and to keep the lid from slamming on your baby's head or hands. Consider installing toilet lid locks. Cushion hard edges and sharp corners of furniture. If possible, move sharp-edged pieces of furniture away from high traffic areas. Anchor down unsteady pieces of furniture, such as bookcases. Place furniture away from high windows so children won't climb onto windowsills. Screens aren't strong enough to keep children from falling through windows. Outdoor Safety If there is a swimming pool in your backyard or your neighborhood, make sure it is surrounded by a fence and has a gate that latches or locks. Better yet, never leave your child unattended when outdoors. Cover areas under and around backyard play sets with shock-absorbing material, such as sand, rubber, or mulch, 9-12 inches deep. During hot summer days, check the temperature of slides and swings. They can become hot enough to cause burns to the skin . Always supervise children on playground equipment. Watch for hazards like stair rungs where they can get stuck, missing guardrails, protruding bolts, or dangling ropes or cords. Teach your child to stay away from stray dogs and wild animals like squirrels and raccoons when you go to the park, and make sure they don’t get hold of animal droppings, which can carry germs. Keep your child away from moving machinery, including lawnmowers and overhead garage doors. Also, keep kids away from driveways and streets. Keep your baby in the shade, if possible. Their skin is thinner and more sensitive. Cover them up with clothes and a hat, limit their time in the sun (especially between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., when the sun is strongest), don’t let them get overheated, and get them out of the sun right away if they show any signs of sunburn or dehydration , including fussiness, redness, and excessive crying. Don’t put bug spray on babies younger than 2 months. Keep them inside when bugs are biting at dawn and dusk. Cover their skin with long sleeves and pants, and cover strollers with mesh netting. Get rid of standing water in your yard where mosquitoes breed, like planters and bird baths. After 2 months bug repellent is OK, but keep it off your baby’s hands and away from their mouth and eyes. Other Baby Safety Precautions Consider taking a certified CPR class if you are not already certified. You can find out about these classes from your local Red Cross or American Heart Association chapter. You may want to post a demonstration chart near your phone. Your baby's caregivers should be CPR-certified. Gather a list of emergency numbers and keep them by the phone. These numbers should include: your child's pediatrician, your health care provider, your family doctor, a 24-hour nurse-on-call number, the police department, the fire department, 911 reminder, and poison control. If a poison is swallowed, call the poison control center (throughout the USA, call 800-222-1222 -- American Association of Poison Control Centers.) Keep poisonous house plants out of reach. For information about which plants are poisonous, contact your local county extension office. Beware of any device that claims to help prevent SIDS. Home monitors, wedges and positioners remain unproven. Name a guardian for your child. In the unfortunate event that something happens to you or your spouse, it's a good idea to have a will that names a legal guardian and alternate guardian for your child. Without a will, the court may appoint a guardian you would not have chosen. Be sure to check with the individuals named in your will to make sure they are willing to serve as your child's guardian. In your will, you can also leave assets to your child in the form of a testamentary, or ""after death"" trust."
15,Causes and Symptoms of Severe Hearing Loss,"For 37 million Americans, the world is a very quiet place. Severe hearing loss can make conversations fade into whispers and turn music into a faint hum. See your doctor as soon as you have trouble hearing. The earlier you get a diagnosis and treatment, the more you can stay involved in the world around you. Symptoms of Severe Hearing Loss If you lose hearing, either suddenly or over time, details of conversations may become fuzzy. Sounds will become muffled and gradually fade. Depending on the cause of your hearing loss , you may also have: Pain in one or both ears Dizziness or vertigo Ringing in the ears, called tinnitus Pressure or fullness in one or both ears Often, people with severe hearing loss withdraw from their social lives because they're embarrassed to ask family and friends to repeat themselves over and over again. They might be afraid they'll misunderstand a conversation and answer with the wrong comments. Learn more about what causes hearing loss . Degrees of Hearing Impairment To find out how impaired your hearing is, your doctor may order a formal hearing test also known as an audiogram. It can show the degree of your hearing loss by looking at the range of decibels -- a measure of loudness -- you can hear. Normal hearing is in the range of 0 to 20 decibels. People with normal hearing are able to make out sounds as faint as human breathing, which measures about 10 decibels. Mild hearing loss ranges from 21 to 40 decibels. Moderate hearing loss ranges from 41 to 55 decibels. Moderately severe hearing loss ranges from 56 to 70 decibels. Severe hearing loss is in the range of 71 to 90 decibels. Profound hearing loss is greater than 90 decibels. People with severe to profound hearing loss will have trouble hearing speech, although they can make out loud sounds like a truck that backfires or an airplane taking off. Types of Hearing Loss There are three main types of hearing loss: Conductive hearing loss happens because of a problem in the ear canal, eardrum, or the middle ear that prevents sound from carrying well to the inner ear. An ear infection , trauma, a mass (cholesteatoma), fluid, or an object in the ear (such as wax buildup) can cause it. Sensorineural hearing loss happens most often from damage to the hair cells in the inner ear. Other causes include damage to the nerve for hearing, called the auditory nerve, or the brain. It usually happens as you get older, but it also can happen because of noise exposure, chemotherapy, radiation, trauma, and your genes. Learn more about what causes sensorineural hearing loss . Mixed hearing loss is a combination of conductive and sensorineural hearing loss. There may be a problem in the outer or middle ear and in the inner ear or auditory nerve. It can happen after a head injury, long-term infection, or because of a disorder that runs in your family. Hearing loss can affect one or both ears. It can happen suddenly or gradually get worse over time. If you notice sudden hearing loss, you should see an ear, nose, and throat specialist as soon as possible. Severe Hearing Loss Causes When your hearing is normal, sound waves enter your outer ear and cause your eardrum and middle ear bones to vibrate. The sound waves then travel through your inner ear, which is a shell-shaped, fluid-filled tube called the cochlea. As the fluid moves, it sets in motion thousands of tiny hairs that convert the sound vibrations into nerve signals. Those signals go to your brain where they are turned into sounds you can recognize. Hearing loss happens when there's a problem with the parts of the ear that you use to hear. Any of these conditions can lead to severe hearing loss: Age. As people get older, some parts in the ear become less elastic. The tiny hairs get damaged and can’t respond to sound waves as well. Hearing loss can get worse over several years. Loud noise. The blare of power tools, airplanes, or loud music on headphones, for example, can damage the hair cells in the cochlea. How much hearing you lose depends on the volume of the sound and how long you were around it. Learn more about noise-induced hearing loss . Ear infections. They can make fluid build up in the middle ear. Usually, the hearing loss from an ear infection is mild and goes away shortly. But if you don’t treat the infections, they can lead to serious long-term problems. Perforated eardrum. An ear infection, loud sounds, trauma, or intense pressure in the ear from flying in an airplane or scuba diving can damage the eardrum, leaving a hole that may or may not heal. Depending on the size of the hole, there may be mild or moderate hearing loss. Cholesteatoma . This is a collection of skin that you can get in the middle ear when the eardrum collapses or when skin grows through a hole in the eardrum. Cholesteatomas grow over time and can lead to hearing loss by destroying the middle ear bones or, rarely, the inner ear. Illnesses or infections. Measles, mumps, syphilis, and meningitis are just a few of the conditions that can cause hearing loss. Meniere’s disease. Symptoms of this inner ear disorder include: Dizziness Hearing loss that comes and goes Ringing in the ear Fullness in the ear Hearing loss in Meniere’s disease usually gets worse but only involves one ear. Tumors. Cancer or benign tumors can cause severe hearing loss. This includes acoustic neuroma , paraganglioma, and meningioma . People who have one might also have numbness in their face or weakness and ringing in their ear. An object stuck in the ear. When something’s in your ear that shouldn’t be, it can block hearing. Earwax can sometimes build up and harden, which can make it hard to hear. Malformed ear. Some people are born with poorly formed ears. Trauma. Injuries like a skull fracture or a punctured eardrum can cause severe hearing loss. Medications . Some types of drugs -- including some antibiotics, large amounts of aspirin , chemotherapy drugs ( carboplatin , cisplatin ), and Vicodin (in large amounts) -- can cause hearing loss. Sometimes hearing will return once you stop taking the drug. In most cases, the hearing loss is permanent. Genes. Scientists have found genes that make people more prone to severe hearing loss, particularly as they age. Most of the time, newborn screening tests find genetic hearing loss, but it can show up later. Autoimmune disorders. Lupus and rheumatoid arthritis , for example, may affect hearing. It’s one of the main features of several autoimmune disorders, including Cogan’s syndrome, Wegener’s granulomatosis, and Behcet’s disease."
16,ADHD: How to Help Your Child Succeed at School,"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) can make you less able to pay attention, concentrate, and remember. Children who have it also can have a tough time connecting with other kids their age. These things can make school especially hard. But there are ways to help your child have an easier time in class. Educate Yourself It helps to be familiar with laws, regulations, and policies that can support your child: Your child’s rights. Two federal laws are in place to make sure children with disabilities get a “free and appropriate education.” The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 require schools to offer services and other things to help children learn. Your state may have other laws about this, too. Individualized education program (IEP). If your child needs specialized instruction to meet their learning needs, they should have an IEP. It will: Detail those needs Explain the services the school will give them Note how their progress will be measured 504 plan. If your child doesn’t need an IEP, this document outlines other ways the school will support them. The plans are tailored for each child's needs. They don't change what's being taught in class. But your child may: Get extra time on tests and schoolwork Have the option to listen to audiobooks instead of reading Give verbal answers to a test instead of written ones Take tests in a different room with fewer distractions or in a smaller group of students Get speech therapy, occupational therapy, or counseling The law doesn't outline a standard way to get a 504 plan. It's up to each school. If you think a plan would help your child, contact your school district and find out what's involved. The policies and support available at your child’s school. Make a written request to your child's principal for an evaluation for services. On its website, an organization called Children and Adults with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (CHADD) offers an example of a letter you might send. Many public schools also offer social skills groups. These are small gatherings – usually between two and eight kids – that are led by a school psychologist or speech therapist. They can help kids learn how to connect with their peers and handle certain social situations. ADHD in children can cause problems with learning and behavior at school. To help your child succeed, educate yourself about their rights and stay in touch with teachers and administrators. (Photo Credit: DigitalVision/Getty Images) Getting Started at a New School Is your child starting middle or high school? Did you move over the summer? A big change like that can be hard for a child or teen with ADHD . Make it easier by reaching out to the school before classes start. Help the new school match your child with the classes and teachers that fit their abilities and learning style. Call the school and arrange to share report cards, test scores, and notes from last year. Meet with the guidance counselor and your child's teachers. You may need to update their 504 plan or IEP, or make a new one. Ask the guidance counselor to take you and your child on a tour of the new school. Meet with teachers, the principal, the nurse, and anyone else your child will see daily. Walk through the whole school day with your child so they know where they need to go and when. If possible, try to arrange a playdate or hangout with another student from your child’s new class. Advance planning and practice, along with familiar routines at home, will help you both get used to this change and maybe feel more confident on the first day of school. Talk With Teachers Meet with teachers to talk about your child's needs and goals, and see what the teacher can do to help them in class. This might include letting them sit in the front row and away from doors and windows. That can help them avoid distractions and stay focused. It also promotes accountability, since the teacher can better see when your child needs help to stay on task. Ask for access to the schedule. You may want to get a second set of books to keep at home. Also, discuss varied teaching methods that could help keep your child interested. You might ask the teacher about helpful technologies, like recording apps that let your child play back discussions and instructions they may have missed in class. Working as a team helps. It shows your child that the most important adults in their life have their back. Here’s how to build a winning parent-teacher team: Have face-to-face talks. Set up meetings early in the school year to talk about how ADHD affects your child. It’s different for everyone, and your kid’s situation is unique. Stay positive. Instead of talking about their problems, focus on what helps them. So avoid saying, “My child never listens.” Replace that with something like, “I find that my child pays more attention when we’re in a quiet space and they look me in the eye.” If you have any educational reports or plans, share copies with the teachers. Keep in touch. Check in regularly in person, by email, or by phone and ask about your child’s behavior and how they’re doing with schoolwork. Find out how much homework the teacher plans to assign each night. You may want to ask for extra help to make sure your child can finish all of their assignments, or for extra time on tests. Check teacher websites for upcoming tests or big projects. Ask for the teacher’s advice on how best to help your child organize and prepare well ahead of the due dates. This can head off a last-minute meltdown for you and your child. Be tactful. Choose your words carefully so you don’t put a teacher on the defensive. Instead of: “Why aren’t you helping my child finish their class assignments in school?” Try this: “I’m concerned that my child needs to finish classwork at home. Is there anything we can do to help them work more quickly at school?"" Don’t take things personally. You may get calls saying your child’s disrupting class or not paying attention. Don’t lash out at the messenger. Instead, say that you know your child often is a handful, and talk about solutions to the problems. Simple things like changing where they sit or giving them directions one task at a time may help. Keep teachers in the loop. If you start or change ADHD medication , tell the teachers and administrators. They can watch for side effects and let you know if medication seems to be helping. Also, let them know if there’s a big change at home – like a divorce or death – since these kinds of things can affect any child’s behavior. Set shared goals. Many ADHD symptoms affect your child inside and outside school. If following directions is a problem, brainstorm with the teacher about ways to help them stay on track that you can use both at home and in the classroom. Using the same tools creates a link between school and home. Be organized at meetings. Parent-teacher conferences are usually short, so come with a list of questions so you don’t forget to ask something important. Organize report cards, test results, and teacher notes in a binder so they’re at your fingertips. Pitch in. Attend back-to-school nights and volunteer to chaperone a field trip or help in the library. That will show the teacher and your child that you’re plugged into the school. And you’ll get a first-hand look at how your child interacts there. Say thank you. When a teacher goes the extra mile to understand and help your child, write a simple note showing your appreciation. It’s also a good idea for your child to have a schedule for the day, and a written behavior plan – which encourages positive actions – posted on a nearby wall or on their desk. How do you know if the teacher or school isn't a good fit? A teacher who is critical and lacks patience will make most kids resist learning, but those children might get by. For a child with ADHD, it could derail an entire school year. A school that encourages a values-based learning process and prides itself on teachers who are excellent role models will most likely be a better fit. You'll want your child to be taught by people who are firm but kind and create a safe and comfortable learning environment. The best schools for kids with ADHD are ones that encourage and maintain an open dialogue among parents, teachers, and staff, so everyone is on the same page as to what's working well and where there are opportunities for improvement. At Home A good way to support your child is to create a routine for when they're home: Ease into a new schedule. If your child slept late during summer vacation, start waking them up a little earlier each day. That way, they won’t be groggy when school starts. Make bedtime a little earlier each night so they get enough sleep. Start them back on any ADHD medicines if you took a break for the summer. Post a routine. Put a list of the daily morning activities on the fridge or somewhere your child will see it. Write down everything they need to do before walking out the door, such as: Get dressed. Make the bed. Eat breakfast . Pack homework. Take your backpack, shoes, jacket, and lunch. Learn More: Sample Morning and Nighttime Schedules for Your Child With ADHD . Get organized. Help your child stay on top of homework. Great tools for organizing include: A calendar or daily planner A dry-erase or bulletin board to post due dates and reminders A desk organizer and storage bins for school supplies to keep their study space neat and free from distractions Color-coded folders or a multipocket binder to keep assignments straight Let them help make a shopping list for supplies for the coming year. Read More: Your Guide to Solving Disorganization at School. Set up a homework station. Choose one spot where your child can do their homework every day. Make sure it's away from distractions like noisy siblings and the TV. (The kitchen table works well for some kids, since you can easily check in on them.) The seat should face a wall, not a window. Try to give siblings their own space, though this may be hard if you have to monitor more than one. Remember that different kids may have different needs. Have them do their homework as close to the same time every day as possible. Let them take a break every 10 to 20 minutes so they can move around. Make sure these breaks don't involve screens like those on a TV or phone. Have them tackle three 20-minute sessions with playtime or a snack in between. Or switch subjects: math for 20 minutes, English for another 20, and then back to math. They'll struggle less, and their work may improve. Make a calendar to keep track of assignments and activities. Set up a way for them to know which assignments are most important. For example, you might color-code things to show priorities. Include things like after-school clubs, sports, music lessons, and regular play dates. Add projects and tests as they come up. Leave room in each day for homework, plus some time to relax and have fun. Let them help set up their schedule so they feel a sense of control and ownership. Go over the schedule each day until they understand the routine. Your kid can even use an app to help organize tasks and manage time. For older kids, listing assignments, deadlines, and upcoming events on a digital calendar can be especially helpful. They can have notifications sent to their phone, and share their calendars with parents and teachers. Plan studying around medication. A child who takes ADHD medication may study better earlier in the afternoon, when the drugs are still in effect. They may have a hard time later in the evening, after they wear off. Motivate with rewards. They're not bribes. It's OK to reward your child when they do a good job. A little encouragement can go a long way. Some parents set up a currency – poker chips, for example – in return for getting homework done. Your kid can turn the chips in later for rewards they like, such as time to watch TV or play a video game. Make sure homework is handed in. Your child might spend hours on their homework but then lose it or forget to hand it in. An organized binder or folder system, with pockets for new assignments and finished homework, can help get the papers across the finish line. They can also use online tools such as Google Docs or OneDrive, which autosave work and let them retrieve it at home or in school. Keep on top of assignments. It's not uncommon for a kid with ADHD to miss a due date or misunderstand instructions. Create a backup plan. Talk to your child's teacher – weekly or even daily – about upcoming assignments. Some teachers post homework on the internet. Others may email copies of assignments directly to you. Ask the teacher to let you know about any late or missing homework. Use concentration aids. White noise machines or apps that feature soothing sounds like rain or ocean waves can block distractions while your child does homework. A loud fan can work, too. Have backup items. Avoid a rough start to your child's day by keeping multiples of easily lost items. Have an extra set of keys, hats and gloves, transit passes, or anything else that tends to go missing on hand to avoid panic and get your child on their way promptly. Plan playdates to improve social skills. If your child struggles with making friends, set up a playdate that includes a structured activity in a setting that's comfortable for them. Talk to them ahead of time about what they can expect and what they should do. To get an idea of your child's social life at school, ask their teacher about classmates who might be a good fit for a  playdate."
17,Hemophilia A,"What Is Hemophilia A? Hemophilia A is a condition that keeps your blood from clotting the way it should. That means your body has problems stopping bleeding, both outside and inside your body. Your condition can be treated, and in some cases you can give yourself the treatment at home. You can lead a full life when you have the right treatment plan in place. There are different types of hemophilia. With hemophilia A, your body doesn't have enough of a protein called factor VIII, which it needs to make clots and stop bleeding. Hemophilia A can be mild, moderate, or severe, depending on how little you have of factor VIII. More than half of those with the condition have the severe form. Hemophilia A usually runs in families, but about one-third of people with the disease don't have a family history of it. Hemophilia A Causes Hemophilia A comes from your genes. You can inherit it from your parents. Or it can happen if a certain gene changes before you're born. This change is called a spontaneous mutation. The hemophilia A gene mutation happens on the X chromosome. Women get one X chromosome from their mother and one from their father. Men get an X from their mother and a Y from their father. Most women with the problem gene are carriers and have no symptoms, but they can pass it to their sons. Therefore the disease nearly always shows up in boys, not girls. A rare type of hemophilia A is acquired hemophilia. It’s most common in people 60 to 80 years of age. If you have this kind, your immune system attacks healthy tissue called clotting factors in your blood. Acquired hemophilia tends to happen alongside these conditions: Pregnancy Autoimmune conditions Cancer Multiple sclerosis Hemophilia A Symptoms The symptoms of hemophilia A depend on whether you have a mild, moderate, or severe case. Mild hemophilia A. If you're in this group, you may have an episode of heavy bleeding: After you have surgery or another procedure, like having a tooth pulled After childbirth After a serious injury During your period Some people don't get a diagnosis until after one of these things happens to them when they're adults. Moderate hemophilia A. Moderate hemophilia usually means you: Bleed a lot when injured Bleed without an injury (spontaneous bleeding) Bruise easily Bleed a lot after a vaccination Severe hemophilia A. In addition to bleeding after an injury, you may have frequent episodes of bleeding, often into the joints and muscles, without being able to figure out a specific cause. When you have severe hemophilia A, bleeding can also happen in your brain . It’s rare, but if you have a head bump -- even if it's minor -- and you have any of these symptoms, call your doctor: Prolonged headache Throwing up Sleepiness or tiredness Sudden weakness or problems walking Double vision Convulsions or seizures Hemophilia A  Diagnosis If you have a family history of hemophilia and are pregnant, tests can tell if your baby has the disease. There are risks though, so you’ll want to talk to your doctor about testing. In children, doctors usually diagnose severe cases in the first year of a baby’s life. Does your child bruise easily or bleed for longer than normal from small injuries? Make an appointment with your child's doctor. They can tell if it's hemophilia. It's unusual for a baby younger than 6 months old to be diagnosed with hemophilia. That's because infants this young usually don't do things that would make them bleed. Once a baby starts moving, crawling, and bumping into things, you may notice raised bruises, especially on places like the stomach, chest, back, and bottom. The doctor may ask: What happened to cause the bumps, bruises, and bleeding? How long did the bleeding last? Is your child taking any medications? Are there any other medical concerns you have? What's your family's medical history? Does anyone have a problem with blood clotting? The doctor may also do blood tests like these, or they may send you to a specialist called a hematologist for them: Complete blood count ( CBC ). This test looks at the number of different types of cells in your blood as well as your hemoglobin levels to see if bleeding has lowered them. Prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (PTT). Both of these tests check how long it takes blood to clot. Factor VIII and factor IX tests , which measure levels of each of those proteins. Factor VIII is for hemophilia A. Factor IX is for hemophilia B, another type of hemophilia. Fibrinogen test. This test shows how well you form clots. Genetic testing , which can help you gauge your chances of having complications from some treatments. And if you're a woman, you'll learn if you're a carrier. Questions for Your Doctor If you or your child is diagnosed with hemophilia, you'll probably have a lot of questions for your doctor, including: How often will you need to visit the doctor? How long is too long to bleed from a small cut? Are some symptoms more serious than others? What are they? And what do you do if you have them? Are there over-the-counter medicines you should or shouldn't use? What treatments does the doctor recommend? How do you keep your child safe? Do you need to limit their activities? Do you need to let teachers and care providers know about their condition? What can you expect as your child gets older? How do you connect with other families that have kids with this condition? What are the chances your other children will have hemophilia? Or that your grandchildren will have it? Hemophilia A Treatment The kind of treatment you get depends on a lot of things, including how severe your condition is, how old you are, and your personal needs. The best place to go for treatment is a federally funded hemophilia treatment center (HTC). You’ll work with a team of specialists, such as surgeons, dentists, physical therapists, and social workers who focus on the blood disorder . You might need to get regular treatment to prevent bleeding, which you may hear your doctor call ""prophylactic"" therapy. Or you may need treatment at the time your bleeding happens, which is called ""on-demand"" therapy. The goal of treatment is to give you the factor VIII your body doesn't make. That's called factor replacement therapy. It's not a cure, but it does help control your hemophilia. Replacement therapy works in most cases. But there's a 20% to 30% chance your body will reject it. In that case, your doctors may try different sources for factor VIII, or try different amounts. There are two types of factor VIII that your doctor may suggest: A ""concentrated"" version that comes from human blood. A ""recombinant"" version, which is more common, is made from cells that are genetically engineered to make factor VIII. Some of them have ""extended half-lives,"" which means they can stay in the blood longer. These products go into your bloodstream through an IV. If you have mild or moderate hemophilia A, you may be treated with desmopressin ( DDAVP ). Desmopressin raises the levels of factor VIII in the blood, and you take it through an IV or as a nasal spray. Drugs known as antifibrinolytics, such as aminocaproic acid and tranexamic acid , can also help if you have a mild form of the disorder. You take them by mouth. They slow the breakdown of clotting factors in the blood. Emicizumab -kxwh (Hemlibra) is a medicine that can help prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes in adults and children with hemophilia A. It bridges the gap in the clotting factors left by the missing factor VIII. You take this medication weekly with an injection. A health care professional can give the injection, or you can learn to do it yourself. Work closely with your doctor if you’re prepping for surgery, travel, pregnancy, or delivery. Since hemophilia A may mean you get blood donations, you should get vaccinated for hepatitis A and B. Innovations in Hemophilia A Treatment Some new treatments are in clinical trials. If they're approved, they could help you manage your disease with fewer injections. Some might even cure hemophilia A. One of the most promising treatments in the pipeline is gene therapy. It uses a virus to deliver a normal copy of the mutated gene to your liver cells. The virus is changed first so that it can't make you sick. Once the new gene is inside your liver, it tells your cells to make factor VIII. With gene therapy, you only need one treatment to fix the problem. Gene editing is another hemophilia treatment that researchers are studying. It removes or fixes the faulty parts of the gene so that it can tell your body to make the right protein. Scientists are also looking into cell therapy. It changes liver cells in a lab to make them produce clotting factors. When those cells go into your body, they keep making the clotting factors you need. Other new treatments in the works could help factor replacement therapy last longer. These treatments could prevent bleeding with fewer injections. Hemophilia A Complications You may notice problems that stem from your hemophilia A, including: Bleeding in deep muscle. This can make your arms and legs swell. The swelling can press on your nerves and lead to numbness or pain . Joint damage. The same pressure from internal bleeding can affect your joints and cause severe pain. If you don’t treat it, you may eventually develop arthritis or your joint could wear away. Infection. Although blood products have become much safer since the 1980s, you’re at a higher risk of receiving contaminated blood because of the number of blood transfusions you may get. Bad reaction to clotting factor treatment. Some people with severe hemophilia have a negative reaction to the clotting factors that treat bleeding. This happens when the immune system makes proteins called inhibitors that turn off the clotting factors. Treatment won’t work as well when this happens. How Hemophilia A Might Change Over Time The severity of hemophilia A doesn't change. Mild, moderate, or severe disease will stay that way your whole life. If your cells can't make clotting factor during childhood, they still won't make it when you're an adult. But your factor levels and how much you bleed can change slightly over time. Some people with hemophilia A have more bleeding episodes in childhood and during their teen years. By adulthood, these episodes happen less often. People with the mild form of the disease may not have any bleeding episodes until they're adults. Things like stress or an infection can change your factor levels and cause more bleeding episodes if you have mild hemophilia. You might bleed more after you have surgery or go to the dentist. Your factor level might change slightly, but it should stay in the same range as other people with mild disease. Hemophilia A Outlook Treatments for hemophilia A have improved a lot. They can help you lead a full and active life with the disease. Your outlook depends on how much clotting factor your body makes and what other health conditions you have. About half of people with hemophilia A have the severe type, in which their body makes little to no factor VIII. Severe disease can cause serious problems like brain bleeding and joint damage. Starting factor replacement therapy early can help prevent these problems. Staying at a healthy weight is another way to protect your joints and prevent complications. Your outlook may not be as good if your body rejects the factor. What to Expect You can do a lot to help manage your hemophilia day to day. Keep up with your treatment, follow your doctor's advice, and do these four things: Handle injuries correctly. Clean small cuts, scrapes, and injuries. Then apply pressure and a bandage. Serious injuries need medical attention. Tell all your health care professionals that you have (or your child has) hemophilia. Remind them before you schedule any procedures, like dental work. You may need to take medications to help clot your blood beforehand. Keep good dental hygiene so you can help prevent dental work that could cause bleeding. Certain medications, like aspirin and other NSAIDs, can slow blood clotting, so check with your doctor about what you should and shouldn't take. Avoid blood thinners . Also check with your doctor about vaccines , like those for hepatitis A and B, that you may need. Most blood products these days are checked for things that can cause disease, but it's still worthwhile to check if you need to take steps to prevent getting infected. Stay active. Exercise makes you stronger, which makes injuries less likely. It also helps by managing weight -- extra pounds strain the body, which raises the risk of bleeding. Talk with your doctor about what activities you or your child can do. Just take some precautions: Children should wear knee pads, elbow pads, and helmets during any activities if they're doing something that might make them fall. Use safety straps in car seats, strollers, and high chairs. Check your home and yard for hazards, like furniture or play equipment with sharp corners. Learn more about hemophilia. If your child has it, let them know when and how to get help so they feel confident, not scared. Information for Caregivers As a caregiver, you play an important role in helping your loved one manage hemophilia A. You can help your child get the right treatment and prevent bleeding problems. You'll be a better caregiver if you learn about hemophilia A, its symptoms, and how to treat it. Your child's doctor is a good person to ask about these things. Make sure your child goes to every doctor visit and takes their medication as prescribed. Learn which sports and other activities are safe to do with hemophilia. Also learn which medications to take for common childhood illnesses and which to avoid. Create a care plan. Ask the doctor what to do if your child gets injured and bleeds. Also tell your child's teachers, babysitters, and other caregivers what to do in case of injury. Caregiving can be a big job. It's normal to feel tired and burned out when you're trying to manage a loved one's chronic disease. Give yourself time for breaks during the day. Take a walk, watch a movie, or do something else to help yourself. If you feel overwhelmed, ask for help from loved ones, a social worker, or a counselor. Getting Support Many other people have hemophilia, and their advice can be helpful and inspiring, especially if you're just starting to get familiar with the condition. The National Hemophilia Foundation can connect you to a treatment center near you and to support groups. The federal government pays for a network of more than 140 hemophilia treatment centers where you can get treatment, education, and other resources you need."
18,Hemophilia B,"What Is Hemophilia B? If your child has hemophilia , their blood doesn't clot like it should. If they have a cut, scrape, or other injury, they will bleed longer than other people do. The bleeding can happen both on the surface or inside their body. It can be serious. With the right treatment, though, and by avoiding certain risks, your child can have an active life. People with hemophilia don’t have enough of a protein that helps blood clot . There are two main types of the condition: A and B. Your child's type depends on which protein, or clotting factor, they lack. There are 13 of these clotting factors in our blood . With hemophilia B , you don't have enough factor IX . More than half the people with it have a severe case; they have almost no factor IX in their blood. Diagnosis usually comes in early childhood. Only about 2 in 10 people who have hemophilia have this type. It happens more in boys than girls. Causes Most people inherit it from their mother, who carries a faulty gene. But it can also happen when a gene changes (mutates) before birth. Symptoms The two main symptoms are bleeding for longer than normal, and bruising easily. Your child may have: Nosebleeds for no apparent reason Lots of blood loss from small cuts Long-term bleeding in the mouth from biting down, or after a tooth is removed Bleeding from a cut or injury that starts up again after stopping Blood in their pee or stool Large bruises If your child has a muscle or joint that is bleeding, it can hurt, especially when they move it. Usually it's swollen and hot to the touch. With this disease, even a small bump to the head can be serious. If it happens, get emergency medical help for any of these signs of bleeding in the brain : Headache Neck pain and stiffness Vomiting Sleepiness Sudden weakness or problems walking Getting a Diagnosis In the first 6 months of life, babies don’t fall or get hurt often, so an early diagnosis is rare. You may start noticing issues once your baby becomes more active. As they begin to crawl, they may get bumps and raised bruises . There may be bleeding in the joints. Bruising and long-lasting bleeding from even small injuries may cause a doctor to suspect hemophilia. The doctor may ask: What happened to cause your child's bumps, bruises, or bleeding? How long did the bleeding last? Are they taking any medication ? Do they have any other medical concerns? Your doctor will also ask about your family’s medical history to find out if anyone had a problem with bleeding or blood clotting. To get the diagnosis, doctors will test your child's blood to find out how long it takes to clot and to see if it's missing any clotting factors. This often includes: Complete blood count (CBC). It gives important information about the kinds and numbers of cells in your blood. Prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (PTT). Both test how long it takes blood to clot. Factor VIII and factor IX tests. These measure levels of those clotting factors. Questions for Your Doctor If your child is diagnosed with hemophilia B, you'll probably have a lot of questions. You might want to ask your doctor: Is this a severe case? Have you treated someone with this condition before? What treatment do you recommend? How often will we need to come to the doctor's office? How long is too long to bleed from a small cut? What do we need to look out for? Are some symptoms more serious than others? Are there over-the-counter medicines we should or shouldn't use? How do we keep safe? Do we need to limit activities? Do we need to make teachers and care providers aware? How do we connect with other families who have kids with hemophilia? What are the chances our other children will have hemophilia? What about our grandchildren? Treatment There is no cure, but you can manage the condition, and your child can enjoy an active life. They can get the factor IX their body doesn't make. This is called replacement therapy. With this treatment, doctors use a needle to put clotting factor IX into the bloodstream. The replacement protein can come from human blood, or it's made in a lab. If your child has severe hemophilia, they may need regular treatments to prevent bleeding. If they don't, they may need only treatment to stop bleeding after it starts. You can get replacement therapy at a clinic or from a visiting nurse, or you can learn to do it at home. There are newer treatments that range from helping your body create more clotting factors, preventing clots from breaking down, to sealants that can be applied directly to wound sites to promote clotting and healing. Taking Care of Your Child Besides giving any factor replacement that may be needed, quick first aid is important when your child gets hurt. Clean any small cuts, scrapes, and injuries, and immediately apply pressure and a bandage. Serious injuries need medical attention. Exercise and keeping at a healthy weight are important, too. Working out helps strengthen muscles, which can lessen bleeding from injuries. Extra weight puts more strain on the body, and that can increase problems from bleeding. Make sure all your health care providers are aware of your child's condition. They may need to take medications to help clot their blood before certain procedures, like dental work. Some over-the-counter medications, like ibuprofen , can cause bleeding, so check with your doctor before you give any to your child. Try to avoid injuries. Make sure your child wears knee pads, elbow pads, and a helmet while playing. Use safety straps in car seats , strollers, and high chairs. Check your home and yard for possible problems like sharp edges. What to Expect With the right precautions and planning, your child can keep doing all the things they love to do. See the doctor regularly, and make sure to follow the treatment plan. Getting Support For more information about hemophilia B, visit the web site of the National Hemophilia Foundation ."
19,Nosebleed Causes,"If you’ve ever wiped your nose and seen blood , you’ve had a nosebleed. They’re common: One out of every seven people in the United States will get a one at some point. They’re most common in kids between 2 and 10 years old and adults between 50 and 80 years old. Types of Nosebleeds A nosebleed comes from the front of your nose (anterior) or the back of it (posterior). Anterior nosebleeds. The wall that separates your nostrils is called the septum. It has a lot of blood vessels that can break from a hit in the face or even a scratch of your fingernail. Most nosebleeds start in the lower part of the septum, meaning close to your nostrils. Posterior nosebleeds. These are more rare. They start deeper in the back of your nose. Posterior nosebleeds are more likely to happen in older people, those with high blood pressure , or those who have had a face injury. It can be hard to tell if you have a posterior or anterior nosebleed. Both can make blood flow toward the back of your throat if you’re lying on your back. But posterior nosebleeds can be much more serious. You’re more likely to need emergency help. Nosebleed Causes Most are spontaneous, meaning they happen unexpectedly and don’t have a known cause. But if you get nosebleeds a lot, there may be a reason you can pinpoint: Dry climates or dry, heated air that dries out the inside of your nose Picking your nose or rubbing it too hard An upper respiratory infection like a cold Repeated nose-blowing An injury to your nose or a foreign object in your nose A deviated septum Allergies or allergy medicines that can dry out your nose, like antihistamines and decongestants Certain blood thinners Taking aspirin regularly Nasal sprays A sinus infection Chemicals that irritate your airways, like ammonia Pregnancy Alcohol use Also called Osler-Rendu-Weber syndrome, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is an inherited condition that causes malformations of blood capillaries that develop on the skin and mucous membranes. They may cause nose bleeds and iron deficiency anemia resulting from bleeding in the stomach or elsewhere in the gastrointestinal tract. Nosebleeds can also be caused by bleeding disorders, but it’s rare. If your nosebleed doesn’t stop, or you have a lot of bleeding from your gums or when you get minor cuts, see a doctor. Bleeding disorders can be serious because platelets in your blood that help it clot are missing or aren’t working. Another rare cause of nosebleeds can be a tumor in the nose or sinuses . It may be noncancerous, also called benign, or cancerous. Only about 2,000 cases of cancerous tumors in the nose or sinuses are diagnosed in the U.S. each year. In some cases, nosebleeds can be caused by genes passed down in families. A rare condition called hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) affects the blood vessels. The main symptom is repeated nosebleeds that seem to come out of nowhere and get worse over time. If you have HHT, you might wake up at night with your pillow soaked in blood, and you may develop red spots on your face or hands. If one or both of your parents has this condition and you’re having nosebleeds, ask your doctor about being tested for it. Treatments can help improve your symptoms."
20,Henoch-Schonlein Purpura (HSP),"Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP) is a disease involving inflammation of small blood vessels. It most commonly occurs in children. The inflammation causes blood vessels in the skin , intestines , kidneys , and joints to start leaking. The main symptom is a rash with numerous small bruises , which have a raised appearance, over the legs or buttocks. Henoch-Schonlein purpura. Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP) is a disease that involves inflammation which causes blood vessels in the skin, intestines, kidneys, and joints to start leaking. The main symptom is a rash with numerous small bruises, which have a raised appearance, over the legs or buttocks. Other symptoms can include joint and abdominal pain as well as kidney impairment. HSP most commonly occurs in children and in boys more than girls. Adults who develop it generally experience more severe cases. Although HSP can affect people at any age, most cases occur in children between the ages of 2 and 11. It is more common in boys than girls. Adults with HSP are more likely to have more severe disease compared to children. HSP usually ends after four to six weeks -- sometimes with recurrence of symptoms over this period, but with no long-term consequences (recurrences are fairly common). If organs such as the kidneys and intestines are affected, treatment is often needed and it is important to have regular follow-up to prevent serious complications. Causes and Risk Factors for Henoch-Schonlein Purpura The exact cause of HSP is not known. The body's immune system is believed to play a role in targeting the blood vessels involved. An abnormal immune response to an infection may be a factor in many cases. Approximately two-thirds of the cases of HSP occur days after symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection develop. Some cases of HSP have been linked to vaccinations for typhoid, cholera , yellow fever , measles , or hepatitis B; foods, drugs, chemicals, and insect bites. Some experts also say that HSP is associated with the colder weather of fall and winter. Symptoms of Henoch-Schonlein Purpura The classic symptoms of HSP are rash , joint pain and swelling, abdominal pain , and/or related kidney disease , including blood in urine. Before these symptoms begin, patients may have two to three weeks of fever, headache, and muscular aches and pains. Rarely, other organs, such as the brain , lungs , or spinal cord may be affected. Here are some key details about the symptoms of HSP: Rash. The rash usually appears in all patients with HSP. The initial appearance may resemble hives , with small red spots or bumps on the lower legs, buttocks, knees , and elbows. But these change to appear more like bruises . The rash usually affects both sides of the body equally and does not turn pale on pressing. Arthritis . Joint inflammation, involving pain and swelling, occurs in approximately three-quarters of cases, particularly affecting the knees and ankles . It usually lasts only a few days and does not cause any long-term, chronic joint problems. Abdominal pain. In more than half of people with HSP, inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract may cause pain or cramping; it may also lead to loss of appetite, vomiting , diarrhea , and occasionally blood in the stool. In some cases, patients may have abdominal pain before the rash appears. In rare cases, an abnormal folding of the bowel (intussusception) may cause a bowel blockage, which may require surgery to fix. Kidney impairment. HSP can cause kidney problems, indicated by such signs as protein or blood in the urine . This is usually only discovered on urine testing, since it does not generally cause any discomfort. In most patients, the kidney impairment is mild and goes away without any long-term damage. It's important to monitor the kidney problems closely and make sure they clear up, since about 5% of patients may develop progressive kidney disease. About 1% may go on to develop total kidney failure. Henoch-Schonlein Purpura Diagnosis and Treatment The diagnosis of HSP may be clear when the typical rash, arthritis , and abdominal pain are present. A doctor may order some tests to rule out other diagnoses, confirm the diagnosis, and assess its severity. Occasionally, when the diagnosis is uncertain, particularly if the only symptom is the classic rash, your doctor may perform biopsies of the skin or kidney. Urine and blood tests will likely be done to detect signs of kidney involvement and may need to be repeated during follow-up to monitor any changes in kidney function. Although there is no specific treatment for HSP, you can use over-the-counter pain medicines, such as acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ), such as ibuprofen and naproxen for joint pain. In some cases, corticosteroid medication may be used. The rash and joint pain will usually go away after four to six weeks without causing any permanent damage. Bouts of the rash may recur in approximately one-third of cases, but usually they are  milder, do not involve joint and abdominal symptoms, and they clear up on their own."
21,Hepatocellular Carcinoma,"What Is Hepatocellular Carcinoma? Hepatocellular carcinoma is a cancer that starts in your liver. It's different from ""secondary"" liver cancers, which have spread to the liver from other organs. If caught early, it can sometimes be cured with surgery or transplant. In more advanced cases it can’t be cured, but treatment and support can help you live longer and better. It's important to remember that you still have control over the decisions you make about your treatment and your life. Make sure you have people you can talk to about your plans, your fears, and your feelings. Ask your doctor about support groups, where you can meet people who know what you're going through. Your doctor can help you understand your treatment options. Surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and target therapy may be some of your choices. Causes Doctors aren't sure exactly what causes all cases of hepatocellular carcinoma, but they've identified some things that may increase your risk for getting it: Hepatitis B or hepatitis C. Hepatocellular cancer can start many years after you've had one of these liver infections. Both are passed through blood, such as when drug users share needles. Blood tests can show whether you have hepatitis B or C. Cirrhosis. This serious disease happens when liver cells are damaged and replaced with scar tissue. Many things can cause it: hepatitis B or C infection, alcohol drinking, certain drugs, and too much iron stored in the liver. Heavy drinking. Having more than two alcoholic drinks a day for many years raises your risk of hepatocellular cancer. The more you drink, the higher your risk. Obesity and diabetes. Both conditions raise your risk of liver cancer. Obesity can lead to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, which can lead to hepatocellular carcinoma. The higher risk from diabetes may be due to liver damage caused by the disease. Plus, people with diabetes are often overweight or obese. Anabolic steroids. Drugs that mimic the male sex hormone testosterone are sometimes used by athletes to build muscle mass. Long-term use increases your risk. Iron storage disease. This causes too much iron to be stored in the liver and other organs. People who have it may develop hepatocellular carcinoma. Aflatoxin. This harmful substance, which is made by certain types of mold on peanuts, corn, and other nuts and grains, can cause hepatocellular carcinoma. The U.S. has safety measures that limit aflatoxin in the food supply. Symptoms You might not have any symptoms when hepatocellular carcinoma is in an early stage. As the cancer grows, you may have one or more of these: Pain in the upper right part of your belly A lump or feeling of heaviness in your upper belly Bloating or swelling in your belly Loss of appetite and feelings of fullness Weight loss Weakness or deep fatigue Nausea and vomiting Yellow skin and eyes Pale, chalky bowel movements and dark urine Fever Getting a Diagnosis Your doctor will give you a physical exam and may ask you questions like: Have you had any pain in your belly? Are you feeling weak or tired? Is your appetite down? Have you lost weight? Your doctor may use tests to help diagnose hepatocellular carcinoma: Blood test. Your doctor takes a sample of your blood and checks to see if it has a protein called AFP. :  Unborn babies have high levels of AFP, but it decreases in most people right after birth. If your blood has a high amount of AFP, it could be a sign of liver cancer. Imaging tests. Your doctor may ask you to get an ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI to look for tumors in your liver. An ultrasound creates images of your liver with sound waves. A CT scan is a powerful X-ray that makes detailed pictures inside your body. An MRI uses strong magnets and radio waves to make an image of your liver. Liver biopsy. Your doctor may want to remove a sample of your liver tissue and check it under a microscope for cancer cells. This can be done several ways. In one method, your doctor removes some liver tissue with a needle that they place through your skin and into your liver. They numb the area first so you won't feel pain. Your doctor may also do a biopsy by making a small cut in your belly and putting a needle into the liver to pull out a sample of tissue. You'll get anesthesia first, so you won't be awake while this is going on. Questions for Your Doctor Has my liver cancer spread? What treatment do you recommend? What are the side effects? What can help my pain and treatment side effects? What kind of follow-up care will I need? Treatment There are many treatments for hepatocellular carcinoma. It's a big decision, so work closely with your doctor to make the right plan for you. Your choices may include: Radiation. This uses high-energy rays to kill your cancer cells. Two types of radiation therapy can treat hepatocellular carcinoma: External: You'll lie on a table while a large machine aims beams of radiation at specific spots on your chest or belly. Internal: A doctor injects tiny radioactive particles into the artery that sends blood to your liver. These block or destroy the blood supply to the tumor in your liver. Radiation therapy can cause side effects, including nausea, vomiting, or tiredness, but these symptoms go away when treatment is done. Chemotherapy. To treat cancer, doctors often place chemotherapy drugs directly into your liver. It's a process called ""chemoembolization."" Your doctor puts a thin, flexible tube into the artery that supplies blood to your liver. The tube delivers a chemo drug combined with another drug that helps to block the artery. The goal is to kill the tumor by starving it of blood. Your liver still gets the blood it needs through another blood vessel. You usually get chemotherapy on an outpatient basis, which means you don't need to stay overnight in a hospital. It can cause side effects, such as nausea and vomiting, loss of appetite, pain, fever and chills, headache, and weakness. You may also be more likely to get infections, bruising, bleeding, and fatigue. Medicine can ease some of these side effects. Alcohol injection. This is also called ""percutaneous ethanol injection."" An ultrasound, which uses sound waves to see structures in your body, helps your doctor guide a thin needle into the tumor. Then they inject ethanol (alcohol) to destroy the cancer. You usually have this procedure under local anesthesia, which means you won't feel pain but you're awake while this is going on. Targeted therapy. The cancer is treated with drugs that target specific changes in cells that cause cancer. Some targeted therapies block new blood vessel growth in tumors. Others target certain proteins found on cancer cells that help tumors grow. Side effects can include fatigue, rash, decreased appetite, diarrhea, pain, bleeding, blistering of hands and feet, and holes in the stomach or intestine. Immunotherapy. This treatment uses drugs that help stimulate your immune system to find and kill cancer cells. Immunotherapy drugs called immune checkpoint inhibitors are sometimes used to treat liver cancer. Side effects can include fatigue, fever, rash, decreased appetite, pain, and an autoimmune reaction involving the lungs, liver, intestine, kidneys, and other organs. Cryoablation and radiofrequency ablation. In cryoablation, your doctor destroys your tumor by freezing it with a thin metal probe. While you're under anesthesia, your doctor puts the probe into the tumor and delivers a cold gas that kills the cancer cells. A similar method, called radiofrequency ablation, uses an electric current to kill the cancer with heat. Surgery to remove part of your liver. Your surgeon may take out the part of your liver that has the cancer, an operation called ""partial hepatectomy."" Healing time varies, but you might have pain and discomfort for the first few days. Medicine can help control it. You may also feel weak or tired for a while. Some people also have diarrhea and a sense of fullness in the stomach. Liver transplant. If your doctor can't remove your cancer through a partial hepatectomy, they may suggest a liver transplant. A liver transplant is major surgery. First, you'll need to get on a waiting list for a donor. Your new liver will come from someone who recently died and has the same blood type and a similar body size as yours. When donor livers are available, they go to the sickest people on the waiting list. Since you may have to wait a long time for a new liver, your doctor may suggest that you keep up with other treatments in the meantime. You may need to stay in the hospital for up to 3 weeks after your surgery. It could take you 6 months to a year before you can return to your regular lifestyle. After your transplant, you'll need to take drugs that prevent your body from rejecting the new liver. If you're considering a transplant, you'll need a lot of emotional support. Ask your doctor about support groups that have people facing the same concerns as you. Also ask about educational workshops that can explain what to expect before and after a transplant. Taking Care of Yourself While you're getting treatment, there are lots of things you can do to manage side effects and stay healthy. Since chemotherapy can sometimes upset your stomach, you can try changing some of your eating habits. For instance, stay away from fried or spicy foods. You can also try eating five or six small meals a day rather than the traditional three meals. If your treatment makes you tired, you can try to take short naps. You also might find that short walks can help boost your energy. If you're stressed about your treatment, sometimes deep breathing and meditation might help you relax. Reach out to family and friends who can give you emotional support when you need it. What to Expect For some people, treatment makes the cancer go away. For others, the cancer may not go away completely or may return. If that's the case, you may need regular treatment to keep it in check for as long as possible. Your treatment to fight liver cancer may stop working. If that happens, you may want to focus on making sure you're as comfortable as possible, known as palliative care. You may not be able to control your cancer, but you control choices about how you'll live your life. You don't have to face things alone. Consider joining a support group, where you can you share your feelings with others who understand what it's like. Getting Support For more information on hepatocellular cancer, go to the web site of the American Cancer Society. You can find out how to join support groups in your area. You can also learn how to take part in a clinical trial, which tests new drugs to see if they are safe and if they work. It's often a way for people to try new medicine that isn't available to everyone."
22,HER2-Positive Breast Cancer,"What Is HER2-Positive Breast Cancer? HER2-positive breast cancer is when breast cancer cells have a protein receptor called HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2). Normally, this protein helps breast cells grow, divide, and repair themselves. But sometimes, something goes wrong in the gene that controls the HER2 protein and your body makes too many of these receptors. This causes your breast cells to grow and divide uncontrollably. About 1 of 5 breast cancers are HER2-positive. While HER2 is more aggressive than other types of breast cancer, there are treatments that can help. You'll go over treatment options with your doctor and come up with a plan that's best for you. Symptoms of HER2-Positive Breast Cancer A lump in your breast that feels different from the area around it is the most common symptom of breast cancer. Other symptoms of HER2-positive breast cancer can include: Breast swelling A change in its shape Skin irritation or dimpling Pain in the breast or nipple Redness or thickness of the nipple or breast skin Discharge from the nipple (not breast milk) You may have noticed a difference in your breasts during a self-exam. Or you may have had a mammogram that showed a growth. Causes and Risk Factors for HER2-Positive Breast Cancer Doctors don't know the exact causes of breast cancer. Experts think it may be a combination of things, including your genes, environment, and lifestyle. You can't inherit a bad copy of the HER2 gene from a parent, and you can't pass it on to your children. Diagnosis of HER2-Positive Breast Cancer If you're diagnosed with breast cancer, the doctor will check to see if yours is HER2-positive. They'll probably give you one or more of these tests: The IHC test uses certain antibodies that identify the HER2 protein in a sample of breast cancer tissue. The FISH test uses fluorescent pieces of DNA that stick to the HER2 gene in cells, which can then be counted under a microscope. The Inform Dual ISH test uses stains that color HER2 genes in a tissue sample so they can be counted under a microscope. Sometimes the results of a single test aren't clear. If that happens, your doctor may order another type. Questions for Your Doctor How are you sure my cancer is HER2-positive? Where exactly is my cancer? What stage is it? What are my treatment options? What treatment do you think will work best for me? How quickly do I need to start the treatment? How will the treatment make me feel? Is there a clinical trial I should consider? Will I be able to work? Do I need to have my breast removed? Do I need radiation? Do I need chemotherapy? Do I need hormone treatment? Will my insurance cover my treatment? What if my cancer doesn't respond to the treatment? HER2-Positive Breast Cancer Treatment Because your breast cancer is HER2-positive, your doctor will treat it a special way. This could involve: Chemotherapy. You might get it before surgery to shrink the tumor, after surgery to kill remaining cancer cells, as treatment for cancer that has spread, or combined with other medications. Radiation. You could get this treatment after surgery to lower the chances your cancer will return or if your cancer has spread to other body parts. There are two main types: External beam radiation. A machine directs radiation to the area where the cancer was. Brachytherapy. Doctors put radioactive pellets inside your body for short periods of time. Surgery. For cancer stages I through III, your treatment will probably start with surgery. There are two main types: Lumpectomy or breast-conserving surgery. The surgeon removes the tumor and some surrounding tissue. Mastectomy. Your entire breast is removed. You could also have surgery to check if the cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). The surgeon removes only the lymph node(s) under the arm to which the cancer would likely spread first. Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). The surgeon removes many (usually less than 20) lymph nodes from under the arm. Surgery may also be an option for stage IV, or metastatic, cancer to prevent or treat symptoms or complications. Targeted therapy. Doctors usually start HER2 treatment with special drugs called targeted therapies. They block HER2 receptors to keep cancer cells from growing. These drugs include: Abemaciclib ( Verzenio ), lapatinib ( Tykerb ), neratinib ( Nerlynx ), tucatanib ( Tukysa ). These drugs block certain proteins called kinases that can cause uncontrolled cell growth. Fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan ( Enhertu ) . This medication combines a chemotherapy drug with trastuzumab, targeting the changes in HER2 and delivering chemotherapy to the cancer cells. Margetuximab ​​​​​​​ ( Margenza ) . This monoclonal antibody drug is sometimes given with chemotherapy to treat advanced breast cancer. Pertuzumab ( Perjeta ). This monoclonal antibody can be given IV with trastuzumab and chemo, either before or after surgery to treat early-stage breast cancer, or to treat advanced breast cancer. Pertuzumab-trastuzumab-hyaluronidase-zzxf ( Phesgo ) These monoclonal antibody drugs stop cancer cells from receiving growth signals. This combination drug is given as an injection under the skin. Trastuzumab and hyaluronidase ( Herceptin Hylecta ) . This form of trastuzumab is given as an injection under the skin. T-DM1 or ado-trastuzumab emtansine ( Kadcyla ). This combination medication delivers the chemotherapy medicine emtansine to HER2-positive cancer cells in a targeted way by attaching it to trastuzumab. You may be on this treatment plan for a long time -- up to a year. It lowers the chances that your disease will come back. If you reach that point and your cancer hasn't gotten worse, your doctor may stop the chemotherapy but keep you on the targeted treatment. Hormone therapy. If your cancer is hormone receptor-positive, then you may also take drugs that stop the hormone estrogen from attaching to the cancer cells. There are two main types: Drugs that block estrogen receptors : Fulvestrant ( Faslodex ) Tamoxifen ( Nolvadex ) Toremifene ( Fareston ) Drugs that lower estrogen levels (aromatase inhibitors, or AIs) : Anastrozole ( Arimidex ) Exemestane ( Aromasin ) Letrozole ( Femara ) Clinical trial. Ask your doctor if a clinical trial is a good option for you. These are studies that test treatments not yet available to everyone to see how well they work and how safe they are. There are pros and cons. Talk to your doctor about them. Taking Care of Yourself Having breast cancer can be overwhelming. Remember, though: You're in control of your treatment decisions and how you live your life. These tips can help you stay healthy while you get treatment: Get the support you need. This could be information about breast cancer, talking with someone, or help with daily tasks. It can all make a huge difference in how you feel. Listen to your body. Exercise can help you feel better, but only when you're up for it. Stay nourished. If you don't have much of an appetite, eat smaller meals every few hours rather than three big meals. Outlook for HER2-Positive Breast Cancer About 80% of breast cancers in the U.S. are what doctors call infiltrating. This means they break through the walls of the glands or ducts where they start and grow into surrounding breast tissue. Of those cancers, around 20% are HER2-positive. Many people do well with targeted treatments. Breast cancer of any kind is easier to treat when it's diagnosed early. But there are still ways to treat it if it spreads or comes back. The outlook for this type of cancer depends on things like the treatment you get and the stage of your cancer. But new treatments like chemotherapy plus trastuzumab have boosted early-stage HER2 positive breast cancer survival rates: 7-year disease-free: Around 93% 10-year disease-free: About 70%-75% Overall: 80%-85% Where to Get Support The American Cancer Society is a good starting place to find the support you and your family may need during treatment and after. You may want to join a support group. That's a good way to meet people who know what you're going through because they've been through it, too. Let your family and friends know how you're feeling. Tell them what they can do to help you. They may want to help but don't know what to do. Also, consider talking with a counselor. That could help you handle the emotions that can come with having cancer."
23,Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia,"Autoimmune hemolytic anemia , or AIHA, is a rare type of anemia . When you have anemia, your bone marrow doesn't make enough red blood cells . Or these cells don't work as well as they should. Red blood cells carry oxygen to your body. When you have too few red blood cells, your body can't get enough oxygen, leaving you feeling tired or short of breath. What is AIHA? Red blood cells are made in the spongy material called bone marrow deep inside your bones. These blood cells normally live for about 120 days. If you have autoimmune hemolytic anemia, your body’s immune system attacks and destroys red blood cells faster than your bone marrow can make new ones. Sometimes these red blood cells live for only a few days. Most people who get AIHA are middle-aged or older. It’s rare in children, and it usually shows up soon after a viral illness and goes away on its own. If your teenager gets it, it could be a sign they have some other health problem. Types of AIHA Autoimmune hemolytic anemia is classified in a few different ways: Primary AIHA: Appears by itself Secondary AIHA: Affects you because you have another illness. The disease is also classified by the temperature at which red blood cells are damaged: Warm antibody hemolytic anemia: The immune reaction takes place at or above normal body temperature. Cold antibody hemolytic anemia: Red blood cells are destroyed when you’re exposed to cold. Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia Signs and Symptoms Many of the symptoms of AIHA are the same as those of other forms of anemia. You may have: Chills Fast heartbeat, known as tachycardia Pale skin that may start to yellow Shortness of breath Weakness and fatigue Chest pain Yellow skin or whites of the eyes ( jaundice ) Dark urine A feeling of abdominal fullness related to an enlarged spleen Some symptoms are different depending on which type of AIHA you have. With cold antibody hemolytic anemia, you may also notice: Cold hands and feet Bluish or reddish color in hands and feet Headache Digestive problems Pain in the back and legs AIHA Causes You can get autoimmune hemolytic anemia if you have an autoimmune disease like lupus . Normally when your immune system spots foreign invaders like bacteria and viruses, it makes proteins called antibodies to attack them. When you have AIHA, your immune system makes antibodies that mistakenly attack your own red blood cells. Other diseases and medications can also cause autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Some of these are: Cancers, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia and non- Hodgkin's lymphoma Infections like Mycoplasma pneumoniae Medicines such as penicillin , methyldopa ( Aldomet ), quinine ( Qualaquin ), and sulfonamides Viruses such as Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, HIV , and hepatitis AIHA Diagnosis If you think you could have any type of anemia, you should talk to your doctor. They may refer you to a hematologist, a doctor who specializes in blood diseases. They’ll most likely discuss your past medical history, medications you take, and talk about your symptoms. They’ll  also request a blood test called a complete blood count, or CBC , to look for signs of anemia. This test measures: The number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets The size of your red blood cells The protein in your red blood cells that carries oxygen (hemoglobin) How much space red blood cells take up in your blood (hematocrit) A low red blood cell count and low hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are signs of anemia. If your CBC test results point to anemia, the doctor might want to do more tests. You might get one of these: Reticulocyte count. This measures the number of young red blood cells in your body. A high reticulocyte count means your bone marrow is making a lot more cells to replace the ones your body has destroyed. Coombs' test. The doctor will do this test to see if your body is making antibodies against red blood cells. Peripheral smear. Your doctor will check your red blood cells under a microscope for signs of blood cell destruction. Bilirubin test. Levels of this substance rise when blood cells are destroyed. Haptoglobin test. This protein clears debris from damaged red cells out of the bloodstream. Levels will be low when it’s being used heavily. Cold agglutinin titer. The doctor may test your level of these antibodies that attack red blood cells at cold temperatures. Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia Treatment If you have a disease like lupus that’s causing your anemia, your doctor will treat it first. If a medication is the cause, you'll likely have to stop taking that medicine. If your AIHA is mild, you may not need treatment. Doctors usually first prescribe steroids , such as hydrocortisone or prednisone , to stop your immune system from attacking your red blood cells. A medicine called rituximab may make steroids work even better. If you don’t improve, you may need surgery to remove your spleen. That’s where much of the destruction of red blood cells takes place. Other medicines such as azathioprine ( Imuran ) and cyclophosphamide ( Cytoxan ) can be used to suppress the immune system. You may need a blood transfusion."
24,Hiatal Hernia,"What Is a Hiatal Hernia? A hiatal hernia is when your stomach bulges up into your chest through an opening in your diaphragm. (Photo Credit: Monica Schroeder/Science Source) A hiatal hernia is when your stomach bulges up into your chest through an opening in your diaphragm, the muscle that separates the two areas. The opening is called the hiatus, so this condition is called a hiatus hernia. Hiatal Hernia Symptoms Many people with hiatal hernia don’t notice any symptoms. Others may have: Heartburn from gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) Chest pain Bloating Burping Trouble swallowing Bad taste in the mouth An upset stomach and vomiting Backflow of food or liquid from the stomach into the mouth Shortness of breath is something you may experience with a hiatal hernia if your hernia is compressing your lungs. Get medical care right away if you have a hiatal hernia and: Severe pain in your chest or belly A persistent upset stomach Vomiting Can’t poop or pass gas These could be signs of a strangulated hernia or an obstruction, which are medical emergencies. Hiatal Hernia Causes Doctors don’t know why most hiatal hernias happen. Causes might include: Being born with a larger hiatal opening than usual Injury to the area Changes in your diaphragm as you age A rise in pressure in your belly, resulting from pregnancy, obesity, coughing , lifting something heavy, or straining on the toilet Hiatal Hernia Risk Factors Hiatal hernias happen more often in women, people who are overweight, and people older than 50. Hiatal Hernia Diagnosis To diagnose a hiatal hernia, your doctor may do tests including: Barium swallow. You drink a liquid that shows up on an X-ray so your doctor can get a better look at your esophagus and stomach. Endoscopy. Your doctor puts a long, thin tube called an endoscope down your throat. A camera on the end shows the inside of your esophagus and stomach . Esophageal manometry (pressure study). A different kind of tube goes down your throat to check the pressure in your esophagus when you swallow. pH test. This measures the acid levels in your esophagus. If anemia is a concern, your doctor may take a blood sample to check your red blood cell count. Hiatal Hernia Treatment Most people don’t notice symptoms of a hiatal hernia and don’t need treatment. Your doctor will decide the best long-term treatment for you, depending on things such as the nature of your hernia, your reflux, and your symptoms. Treatment options are: Wait and watch . You might not need any treatment for your hernia. But your doctor may want to keep an eye on it. Your hernia might get bigger over time. Medications . These can't stop your acid reflux, but they can reduce the acid content in your stomach. This makes your reflux less harmful and uncomfortable. Your doctor may suggest: Antacids to weaken your stomach acid Proton pump inhibitors or H-2 receptor blockers to keep your stomach from making as much acid Prokinetics to make your esophageal sphincter, the muscle that keeps stomach acid from backing up into your esophagus, stronger. They also help muscles in your esophagus work and help empty your stomach. Surgery . You might need a minor surgical procedure to repair your hiatal hernia. Hiatal Hernia Surgery Hiatal hernia surgery has a 90% success rate. You'll likely be able to stop medications and have no more acid reflux after hiatal hernia surgery. But studies show that up to 50% of hiatal hernias eventually return after surgery, usually after many years. If you have a paraesophageal hernia (when part of your stomach squeezes through the hiatus), your doctor might do surgery so your stomach doesn’t become strangled. You may also need surgery if sliding hernias bleed or become large, strangulated, or inflamed. In surgery, your doctor reinforces your hiatus and moves your stomach. Many hiatal hernia surgeries use a method called laparoscopy. Your doctor will make a few small (5 to 10 millimeter) cuts in your belly. They insert a tool called a laparoscope through these incisions, and it sends pictures to a monitor so your doctor can see inside your body. These “minimally invasive” procedures have smaller cuts, lower risk of infection, lesser pain and scarring, and faster recovery than traditional surgeries. Recovery from Hiatal Hernia Surgery You may need to stay in the hospital for 1-2 days, depending on your situation and the kind of surgery you had. Your recovery is usually quicker when you have laparoscopic surgery or robotic surgery for hernia repair. That’s because you have small, keyhole incisions instead of the larger incision needed for an “open” surgery. But sometimes, you may need a more involved “open” surgery . After the hospital, your home recovery will last 2-6 weeks. During this time, your doctor will prescribe a diet of clear liquids at first, and then soft foods, before you can eventually eat solid food again. Foods to avoid while you recover from hernia surgery include those that are hard to digest, such as red meat. You'll also want to avoid spicy foods and others that can cause acid reflux, such as chocolate and anything with caffeine. It's also best to not have orange juice or fried food. Weight loss is common after hernia surgery, with an average loss of 10 to 15 pounds. Hiatal Hernia Lifestyle Changes and Home Remedies Some changes to your daily life can help with acid reflux symptoms . They include: Don’t exercise or lie down for 3 or 4 hours after you eat. Avoid acidic foods such as orange juice, tomato sauce, and soda. Limit fried and fatty foods, alcohol, vinegar, chocolate, and caffeine. Eat smaller meals (four or five small meals each day) and eat slowly. Lift the head of your bed about 6 inches and sleep on your left side to help prevent reflux. A body pillow may also help. Don’t wear tight belts or clothes that put pressure on your belly. Lose extra pounds. Don’t smoke. Smoking can cause intense heartburn. Have an early dinner. Avoid lying down for a few hours after eating to keep gravity on your side. Hiatal Hernia Types There are two main types of hiatal hernias: Sliding hiatal hernias (Type 1). Your esophagus (food pipe) usually goes through the hiatus and attaches to your stomach. But in a sliding hiatal hernia, your stomach and the lower part of your esophagus slide up into your chest through the diaphragm . About 95% of all hiatal hernias are this type. Paraesophageal hiatal hernias. These are more dangerous than sliding hiatal hernias. Your esophagus and stomach stay where they should be, but part of your stomach squeezes through the hiatus to sit next to your esophagus. Your stomach can become squeezed and lose its blood supply. Your doctor might call this a strangulated hernia. The three types of paraesophageal hernias are: Type 2 : This is also called a rolling hiatal hernia. The upper part of your stomach pushes up through the hiatus alongside your esophagus, forming a bulge next to it. Type 3 : This is a blend of type 1 and type 2. In this hiatal hernia, the part of your esophagus connecting to your stomach slides up through the hiatus. Another part of your stomach also sometimes bulges through. Type 4: This is rare and more complex. The hiatus is wide enough for two different organs to herniate through it. The hernia involves your stomach and another abdominal organ, such as your intestines, pancreas, or spleen. Takeaways A hiatal hernia is when your stomach bulges up into your chest through an opening in your diaphragm. Hiatal hernias happen more often in women, people who are overweight, and people older than 50. Most people don’t notice symptoms of a hiatal hernia and don’t need treatment. Doctors don’t know why most hiatal hernias happen, but some factors can increase your risk. Most hiatal hernias aren't serious but some are. Treatment for your hiatal hernia depends on your overall condition and the type of hiatal hernia you have. Hiatal hernia surgery has a 90% success rate. Hiatal Hernia FAQs What are three signs of hiatal hernia? Three signs you might have a hiatal hernia are heartburn, regurgitation of food or liquids into your mouth, and backflow of stomach acid into your esophagus (acid reflux). Is hiatal hernia a serious condition? Not usually. But a large hernia can become serious. How does a hiatal hernia feel? It varies, and you might have no pain at all. But if you do, you might feel pain in your chest or abdomen. You might feel it when you bend over, cough, or lift something heavy. You may feel hernia pain related to acid reflux. That can be high or low in your chest and feel like burning or even a heart attack."
25,Why Do  I Hiccup?,"Once is funny, twice is hilarious, and anything more than that is usually just annoying. We’ve all had them, but do you actually know where they come from? They’re hiccups , and they’re the strange little sounds that can escape from your mouth without warning. Hiccups start much lower in your body, though -- in the diaphragm, the dome-shaped muscle between your lungs and stomach . Normally, the diaphragm pulls down when you inhale to let air into your lungs , and then relaxes when you exhale so air can flow back out of your lungs to exit your nose and mouth . But if something irritates your diaphragm, it can spasm, forcing you to suddenly suck air into your throat, where it hits your voice box. That makes your vocal cords suddenly close, creating the distinct “hic!” sound. Why Do Hiccups Happen? Hiccups can happen for a lot of reasons -- some of them are physical, and some emotional. That’s because the actual irritation happens in the nerve connecting the brain to the diaphragm. Some common causes include: Eating too much or too quickly Feeling nervous or excited Drinking carbonated beverages or too much alcohol Stress A sudden change in temperature Swallowing air while sucking on candy or chewing gum Long-term Hiccups Hiccups are usually temporary, but in rare cases, they can stick around -- for a while. It’s usually because of damage or aggravation to the nerves connected to the diaphragm. Everything from a hair touching your eardrum to a sore throat can affect these nerves, and in more serious cases, a tumor, goiter , or cyst in the neck can damage them. Hiccups that last a while can also be because of central nervous system disorders like encephalitis or meningitis , or metabolic disorders like diabetes or kidney failure . Drugs like steroids or some tranquilizers can trigger long-term hiccups, too. And even certain procedures, especially ones that require anesthesia, can give you hiccups. If you’ve been hiccupping for more than 2 days, or if they are severe enough to interfere with eating, breathing, sleeping or are causing you distress, you should make an appointment with your doctor. Also, talk to your doctor immediately if you have any kind of stomach pain , fever, shortness of breath, vomiting , or cough up blood with your hiccups. How to Make Them Stop If you’re hoping that hanging upside down or having a friend scare you will get your hiccups to stop, we hate to disappoint you. But there’s no scientific proof that these remedies work. However, some experts think holding your breath or breathing into a paper bag might do the trick; both techniques make carbon dioxide build up in your lungs, which might relax the diaphragm. If all else fails, and your hiccups continue for several days or more, your doctor may try different medications to see if they can put an end to those uncomfortable hiccups. Good luck!"
26,Hidradenitis Suppurativa,"What Is Hidradenitis Suppurativa? Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic inflammatory condition that causes painful bumps under your skin in the hair roots and near sweat glands. It’s also known as acne inversa. The bumps can get infected. When that happens, pockets form under your skin and fill with pus. They can smell bad when they break open. They can also leave scars. Skin problems with HS start when your hair follicles get blocked. You might get the first symptoms in your teens or 20s. (GIRAND/Science Source) There's no cure for HS, but treatments and lifestyle changes can bring some relief and cut down on flare-ups. Because this condition lasts a long time, it can be frustrating and can take an emotional toll on you. Make sure you get the support you need. How Common Is Hidradenitis Suppurativa? It affects about 1 in 100 people. For those who have this condition, it usually starts between puberty and age 40 -- most often between ages 21 to 29. Women are three times more likely to have it than men are. Hidradenitis Suppurativa Causes Doctors aren't sure what causes hidradenitis suppurativa, but it’s probably a combination of your genes, hormones, and the environment. It's more common in women than in men. It’s also more likely if you’re overweight or you smoke, and if you had acne . About a third of people who get HS have a relative with it. The skin problems start when your hair follicles get blocked. You might get the first symptoms in your teens or 20s. You don’t get HS because you don’t wash enough, use deodorants or powders, or shave your underarms. You can't catch it from someone else or give it to another person. Hidradenitis Suppurativa Symptoms HS usually affects both sides of your body. You can get the bumps in one place or in several areas at once. The first warning sign might be a single painful bump that gets inflamed. It can last days or months. You could have repeated outbreaks of a single bump in the same location or the same general area. Besides turning into pockets of pus, the bumps can be itchy. Your skin might have small pitted areas with blackheads. Some people get tunnels under their skin, called sinus tracts, which connect different areas of HS outbreaks. The bumps and leaky pockets can go away and come back. In severe cases, they don't fully heal. Hidradenitis Suppurativa Common Sites Blockages in this condition usually happen in areas where you have hair or where your skin rubs together, such as: Under your arms In your groin Between your buttocks Between your thighs Under your breasts In the folds of your stomach On the nape of your neck Behind your ears Hidradenitis Suppurativa Diagnosis Your doctor will check your skin and make a diagnosis based on where the bumps and pockets are and how often you have them. They may also ask you things like: How long ago did your symptoms begin? Are they painful? Have you had these symptoms before? Have any close relatives had this problem? You probably won’t have tests unless your doctor needs to rule out other kinds of infections. Then, they’ll take a sample of pus and send it to a lab for testing. Questions for Your Doctor How mild or severe is my HS? What treatments are available? Which do you recommend? Should I take an antibiotic? What about other medications ? Could these medications cause side effects? Will I need surgery? What lifestyle changes should I make to improve my illness? Should I lose weight ? If my symptoms get worse, when should I call you? Will the disorder go away on its own? Hidradenitis Suppurativa Stages HS is divided into three stages, based on how severe it is, called Hurley stages. Hurley stage I: A single or multiple isolated bumps with no sinus tracts Hurley stage II: Multiple bumps with some sinus tracts and scarring Hurley stage III: Multiple bumps with a lot of sinus tracts and scars involving an entire area of your body Hidradenitis Suppurativa Treatment There's no cure for HS. It's an ongoing skin condition you may need to manage for years. The right treatments can ease your symptoms and help prevent flares. Your treatment will be based on how severe your case is. You and your doctor might have to try multiple treatments to find the one that works best for you. Treatment options include: Warm compresses. You might try this first if your case is mild. Run a clean washcloth under hot water and hold it on your skin for 10 minutes. NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs). These over-the-counter medicines can ease your pain and help manage swelling. They include: Aspirin Ibuprofen Naproxen Antibiotics . These medications fight infections. You can swallow them as a pill, or you can use a cream, ointment, cleanser, wash, or gel on your skin. At first, you may use doxycycline or minocycline for 2 to 3 months. If that doesn't help, your doctor may suggest a combination of clindamycin and rifampin ( Rifadin , Rimactane ). Corticosteroids. Your doctor injects these medicines into the bumps. They can ease inflammation, pain, and swelling. You usually get these shots once a month for up to 3 months. If your case is severe, your doctor may recommend that you take steroid pills by mouth . Oral retinoids. Your doctor may suggest a retinoid medication in a pill such as acitretin ( Soriatane ) or isotretinoin ( Accutane ). Both can improve severe cases of HS. Topical resorcinol. This is a cream that you put on inflamed areas of your skin. It has chemicals that peel the skin. Hormone therapy . Some women find that their condition gets better if they take birth control pills or a drug called spironolactone . Biologics. These medications work on your immune system , your body's defense system against germs. You take them by getting a shot, either at the doctor's office or at home. Or you may need to get the meds through an IV in your veins. This is done at a clinic or hospital. These drugs include: Adalimumab ( Humira ). This medicine is the only one approved by the FDA to treat HS. Infliximab ( Remicade ). The FDA hasn’t approved this for HS, but doctors still use it. Anakinra , canakinumab, and ustekinumab. These medications may help some people with severe or hard-to-treat HS. Researchers are studying how well they work. Biologics can clear up HS for a long time, but they can also have serious side effects, so doctors use them only for severe cases. Other medications. These include: Metformin (Glucophage). Doctors use this to treat adult-onset diabetes and metabolic syndrome . It may also help patients with HS. Methotrexate (Xatmep). It is a pill, shot, or IV that controls the inflammation of psoriasis and other medical conditions, including some cancers. It works on your immune system and may help control HS in some people. Surgery. If your bumps grow deep into your skin, you might have a surgical procedure. If you're having problems in a small area, your doctor can cut open pockets to drain pus. This gives you short-term relief. In a procedure called deroofing, your doctor turns deep, painful bumps and pockets into scars that won’t hurt. It's an option if you have painful bumps that come back over and over. Another type of surgery involves cutting out skin in the problem spots. Afterward, your doctor will do a skin graft. They take skin from another part of your body and use it to cover the area where you had the operation. Laser surgery is another option to clear new, deep bumps. It destroys hair follicles, the shafts in your skin where hair grows. You may need several treatments. Success rates for HS surgery can vary long-term. Surgery can help with stubborn or severe cases of HS, but your HS may come back in the same part of your body or somewhere else. Lifestyle Changes for Hidradenitis Suppurativa Try these tips to make your HS less severe and slow outbreaks. Lose extra weight . This can ease your symptoms by making your skin rub together less. Quit smoking . Not only does this cut your risk of cancer and heart disease , but it can make your HS less severe. Talk to your doctor about programs that can help you break the habit. Don’t shave trouble spots. This can keep you from irritating your skin. Ask your dermatologist about other ways to get rid of unwanted hair. Wear loose-fitting clothes. Outfits that are tight can cause your skin to rub, making your flare-ups worse. Stay cool. You can get flare-ups when you get too warm and sweat. But be careful about using deodorants, which can sometimes irritate your skin. Ask your dermatologist for suggestions about one that won't cause problems. Keep clean. Wash HS areas gently every day with your fingers. Scrubbing with a washcloth or brush can irritate your skin. Use an antibacterial soap, which can help get rid of odor. Use the right bandage. If a pocket is leaking, cover it with a bandage that doesn't stick to the bump. Use plenty of petroleum jelly on the gauze that covers the area. Avoid using adhesive tape as much as possible. Hidradenitis Suppurativa Diet More research is needed to know how diet affects your HS. There's no specific HS diet, but what what you eat and drink can help lessen or worsen your condition. The best diet for your HS may be different than what's best others with the condition. However, some studies suggest these might help: Weight loss diet: Weight loss may lessen HS if you're overweight or obese. Weight loss works best in the early stages of HS when you have painful lumps in your skin but no tunnels beneath. Mediterranean diet: This consists of mostly fresh vegetables and fruits, whole grains, fish, beans, seafood, and extra virgin olive oil. It rarely includes red meat. It also cuts out processed foods, including sugary drinks, diet soda, and food like bacon, cold cuts, chicken nuggets, hot dogs, and the like. Some studies suggest you may have milder HS and fewer flares if you follow this diet. Plant-based diet: Your gut contains trillions of microorganisms, which help keep you healthy. Some studies suggest that you have less diverse microorganisms than normal when you have HS. It’s possible that eating a plant-based diet could lead to fewer HS flare-ups. Sugar-free diet: Sugar causes your insulin levels to rise. That can increase HS flare-ups. Research suggests eating less sugar may lead to fewer flares when you have HS. Dairy-free diet: Early studies found those who stopped earing dairy had less HS and their HS didn't get worse. But if you go dairy-free, include foods with the essential nutrients calcium and vitamin D. Food sensitivities: It's possible your food sensitivities can play a role in your HS flare-ups. Talk with your doctor if you have HS and food sensitivities. Talk to your doctor about the best diet for you based on your overall health, type of HS, and any food sensitivities. Don't start a new diet or take supplements without their help. Hidradenitis Suppurativa Complications HS that is severe or isn’t treated can have complications over time, including: Deep pockets of infection (abscesses) Trouble moving because of scar tissue Hollow passages inside your body (fistulas) Lymph node problems Arthritis A skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma Depression and isolation Hidradenitis Suppurativa Myths Some common myths about HS are: It's rare. HS is more common than previously thought. It affects 1%-4% of people in the world. You're more likely to have HS if you're a biological female, Black, a late adolescent, a young adult, or have a family history of HS. It's contagious. There's no way to spread HS from person to person. It's an STD. Because HS can happen in your groin area (including your genitals, anus, and thighs) some think it's an STD. But it isn't. It's caused by poor hygiene. HS is not linked to washing yourself poorly. It can’t be treated. Losing weight, quitting smoking, and caring for your skin properly can make a significant difference in the severity of the condition and your quality of life. Outlook HS can last for years, but early treatment can help you feel better and lower the risk of flare-ups. In severe cases, hidradenitis suppurativa can get worse and cause scars. Surgery can help, although the disease comes back about one-third of the time. It's still important to keep up with lifestyle changes that can make you feel better. Turn to people you trust to give you the backing you need while you get treated. You might join a support group where you can talk freely with people who understand your situation. Ask your doctor about how to find a group near you. Talk to your close family and friends about your condition, or consider seeing a professional counselor. They can help make sure you don't let your skin problems keep you from enjoying an active social life. You can learn more about your condition on the website of the Hidradenitis Suppurativa Foundation. Can You Live a Normal Life With Hidradenitis Suppurativa? You may have to manage your HS throughout your life, but with treatment and support you can live a normal life. Takeaways Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic inflammatory condition that causes painful bumps under your skin in the hair roots and near sweat glands. HS is also known as acne inversa. HS affects about 1 in 100 people. HS usually starts between puberty and age 40, most often between ages 21 and 29. You're more likely to have HS if you're a biological female, Black, a late adolescent, a young adult, or have a family history of HS. HS isn't contagious. HS isn't caused by poor hygiene. HS can last for years, but early treatment can help you feel better and lower the risk of flare-ups. Hidradenitis Suppurativa FAQs What is the main cause of hidradenitis? Its cause is unknown. A combination of genetic, hormonal, and environmental factors likely play a role in its development . What clears up hidradenitis suppurativa? There's no cure. But there are various treatments, lifestyle habits, and diets that may help. Your doctor will help you make a treatment plan that works best for you."
27,Altitude Sickness: What to Know,"Sometimes called “mountain sickness,” altitude sickness is a group of symptoms that can strike if you walk or climb to a higher elevation, or altitude, too quickly. What Causes Altitude Sickness? The pressure of the air that surrounds you is called barometric or atmospheric pressure. When you go to higher altitudes, this pressure drops and there is less oxygen available. If you live in a place that’s located at a moderately high altitude, you get used to the air pressure. But if you travel to a place at a higher altitude than you’re used to, your body will need time to adjust to the change in pressure. Any time you go above 8,000 feet, you can be at risk for altitude sickness. What Are the Types of Mountain Sickness? There are three levels of altitude sickness: Acute mountain sickness (AMS) is the mildest form, and it’s very common. The symptoms can feel like a hangover -- dizziness , headache , muscle aches, nausea . High-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) is a buildup of fluid in the lungs that can be very dangerous and even life-threatening. This is the most common cause of death from altitude sickness. High-altitude cerebral edema (HACE) is the most severe form of altitude sickness and happens when there’s fluid in the brain . It, too, is life-threatening, and you need to seek medical attention right away. What Are Altitude Sickness Symptoms? You might have: Headache Dizziness Nausea Vomiting Fatigue and loss of energy Shortness of breath Problems with sleep Loss of appetite Symptoms usually come on within 12 to 24 hours of reaching a higher elevation and then get better within a day or two as your body adjusts to the change in altitude. If you have a more moderate case of altitude sickness, your symptoms might feel more intense and not improve with over-the-counter medications . Instead of feeling better as time goes on, you’ll start to feel worse. You’ll have more shortness of breath and fatigue . You may also have: Loss of coordination and trouble walking A severe headache that doesn’t get better with medication A tightening in your chest If you develop a severe form of altitude sickness like HAPE or HACE, you might have: Confusion Shortness of breath even at rest Inability to walk A cough that produces a white or pink frothy substance Coma Who Gets Altitude Sickness? Anyone can develop altitude sickness, no matter how fit, young, or healthy they are -- even Olympic athletes can get it. In fact, being physically active at a high elevation makes you more likely to get it. Your chance of getting altitude sickness depends on a few other things: how quickly you move to a higher elevation, how high you go up, the altitude where you sleep , and other factors. Your risk also depends on where you live and the altitude there, your age (young people are more likely to get it), and whether you’ve had altitude sickness before. Having certain illnesses like diabetes or lung disease doesn’t automatically make you more likely to develop altitude sickness. People who have sickle cell anemia, COPD, unstable angina, a high-risk pregnancy, heart failure, or cystic fibrosis are less likely to be able to tolerate the change in altitude. So are people who have had recent heart attacks or strokes. How is Mountain Sickness Treated? If you get a headache and at least one other symptom linked to altitude sickness within a day or two of changing your elevation, you might have altitude sickness. For mild symptoms, you can try staying at your current altitude to see if your body adjusts. Rest, keep warm, and have plenty of liquids. Don’t go any higher until your symptoms are completely gone. If your symptoms are severe, or if mild symptoms don’t go away in a couple of days or get worse, get to a lower elevation as quickly as possible. Don’t exert yourself. Get medical help. Your doctor might listen to your chest with a stethoscope or take an X-ray of your chest or an MRI or CT scan of your brain to look for fluid. To treat HACE, you might need a steroid called dexamethasone. If you have HAPE, you will need supplemental oxygen and may need medications, as well as moving to a lower altitude. How Can Altitude Sickness Be Prevented? The best way you can lower your chance of getting altitude sickness is through acclimatization. That means you let your body slowly get used to the changes in air pressure as you travel to higher elevations. You’ll want to climb to higher altitudes gradually. Going slowly helps your lungs get more air through deeper breaths and allows more of your red blood cells to carry oxygen to different parts of your body. Some basic guidelines for acclimatization are: Start your journey below 10,000 feet. If you have to fly or drive somewhere that’s higher up, stop at one destination that’s lower for at least a full day before going any higher. If you do fly or drive somewhere and can’t spend time at lower elevations on the way, the drug acetazolamide can help speed up acclimatization. If you walk, hike, or climb over 10,000 feet, only go up an additional 1,000 feet per day. For every 3,000 feet you climb, rest at least a day at that height. “Climb high and sleep low”: If you have to climb over 1,000 feet in a day, make sure you come back down to a lower altitude to sleep. Drink 3-4 quarts of water every day, and make sure about 70% of your calories are coming from carbs. Don’t use tobacco , alcohol , or medications such as sleeping pills, especially for the first 48 hours. Caffeine is OK if you normally drink it. Don’t vigorously exercise for the first 48 hours. Know how to identify the first signs of altitude sickness. Move to a lower elevation right away if you start to have these symptoms."
28,Diseases Linked to High Cholesterol,"If you have high cholesterol, you have a higher risk of cardiovascular disease. That can include coronary heart disease, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease. High cholesterol has also been tied to diabetes and high blood pressure. In all cases, the underlying cause is that high cholesterol leads to fatty plaques that build up in arteries all over your body. To prevent or manage these conditions, work with your doctor. You also can take some simple steps that will help you lower your cholesterol -- and your risk of these related diseases. Understanding Cholesterol To understand how cholesterol can lead to diseases, it helps to understand how cholesterol works. There are different types of cholesterol: Low-density-lipoprotein ( LDL ) cholesterol, or “bad” cholesterol. When your LDL cholesterol levels are too high, your arteries can become too narrow and get blocked. This can cause stroke and heart problems. High-density-lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, or “good” cholesterol. Low levels of HDL cholesterol can contribute to heart disease and other issues, especially if your LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels are high. Triglycerides. These are fats from the food you eat that circulate in your body, which can be stored in fat cells. Triglycerides aren’t actually a type of cholesterol, but their levels are measured along with HDL and LDL to see if you are at risk for, or have, atherosclerosis . (That's when fatty deposits build up in your artery walls, restricting blood flow and leading to a variety of issues like aneurysms and heart attacks.) Cholesterol and Coronary Heart Disease The main risk from high cholesterol is coronary heart disease, which can lead to death from a heart attack. If your cholesterol level is too high, cholesterol can build up in the walls of your arteries. Over time, this buildup -- called plaque -- causes arteries to harden and can restrict blood flow (atherosclerosis). Arteries that feed the heart can narrow in certain areas and slow blood flow to part of the heart muscle. Or cholesterol plaques break off and float to smaller blood vessels and cause a partial or total blockage. Sometimes inflammatory cells might go to the broken plaque area and cause a narrowing there as well. Reduced blood flow can result in chest pain called angina, or in a heart attack if a blood vessel gets blocked completely. Cholesterol can build up in the walls of your arteries. Photo credit: Tetiana Pavliuchenko/Dreamstime Cholesterol and Stroke Cholesterol plaques don’t just line your blood vessels in and around your heart. They also narrow certain arteries that lead to your brain. If a vessel carrying blood to the brain is blocked completely, you could have a stroke . Cholesterol and Peripheral Vascular Disease In addition to your heart and your brain, cholesterol plaque can cause symptoms in your legs and other areas outside of your heart and brain (peripheral vascular disease). Legs and feet are most common. You might notice cramps in your calves when you walk that get better with rest. This is like angina -- it works the same way -- but in your legs instead of your heart. Cholesterol and Diabetes If you have diabetes, that can upset the balance between levels of HDL, or “good” cholesterol, and LDL or “bad” cholesterol . People with diabetes tend to have LDL particles that stick to arteries and damage blood vessel walls more easily. Glucose (a type of sugar) attaches to your lipoproteins, which are particles that carry cholesterol and triglycerdies to your cells.  Sugarcoated LDL remains in the bloodstream longer and may help plaque form. People with diabetes, especially type 2 diabetes, can have low HDL and high triglyceride levels. Both of these boost the risk of heart and artery diseases. If you have diabetes and have low levels of good cholesterol but high levels of bad cholesterol and high triglycerides, you have a condition called diabetic dyslipidemia. Up to 70% of people with type 2 diabetes have diabetic dyslipidemia. People with type 1 diabetes who have their blood sugar under control usually have normal levels of cholesterol. If they’re overweight or have obesity, though, they’re more likely to have high cholesterol. But that’s true for people without type 1 diabetes, too. Cholesterol and High Blood Pressure There's a link between high cholesterol and high blood pressure, or hypertension. High cholesterol seems to trigger inflammation and the release of certain hormones that causes blood vessels to tighten up. When that happens it's called “endothelial dysfunction."" Your blood pressure goes up because your heart has to work harder to pump blood through it. High blood pressure is also linked to heart disease. Cholesterol and Erectile Dysfunction Erectile dysfunction is when a person can’t achieve or maintain an erection during sex. Over the long term, high cholesterol seems to trigger a narrowing of the smaller blood vessels of the penis when they should be stretching to allow more blood for an erection ( endothelial dysfunction again). In addition, when you have too much LDL cholesterol, it can build up in arteries and then join with other substances to form plaque that hardens and narrows further blood vessels (atherosclerosis). The result can be less blood flow to both the heart and the penis, which can lead to erectile dysfunction. 5 Steps to Lower Cholesterol and Risks of Related Diseases A few simple changes can lower your cholesterol and cut your risk for conditions linked to high cholesterol. Ask for expert advice on lifestyle changes. Your doctor can help you come up with a plan for healthy eating and exercise. Give your diet a makeover. Go for foods like oatmeal, walnuts, tuna, salmon, sardines, and tofu. Stay away from things that are high in trans fats and saturated fats and simple sugars. Quit smoking . Smoking lowers your “good” (HDL) cholesterol. If you quit, you’ll have more of it. There are lots of other benefits for your whole body. Get moving. Even modest amounts of exercise, like half an hour a day of brisk walking, help you control weight. It’s also good for other things that put you at risk for heart disease, like diabetes and high blood pressure. Exercise can lower your triglyceride levels and raise your HDL cholesterol. Both are good for your heart. Take your medications. Your doctor may prescribe medicines to help lower your cholesterol. Take them as directed. Questions? Ask your doctor or pharmacist.

29,Top Causes of Hip Pain in Children,"Your child uses their hips every day for walking, crawling, sitting, or standing. Because of this, hip problems can come up. This can make it hard for them to move the right way. If your child has a hip problem, they may have hip pain , but they may also have pain in their knee or thigh instead. They might start to limp. Or they may be in too much pain to walk at all. Your child’s hip could hurt for lots of reasons. It may be because of problems they were born with. Infections, injuries, and other things can cause it, too. Transient Synovitis If your child has this common cause of hip pain, they may limp and tell you their hip hurts after sitting for a long time. They'll also walk with their toes pointed outward. They may walk on the tips of their toes, have knee or thigh pain, or refuse to walk if the pain is very bad. Your baby will cry when you move their hip joint . This problem is most common in preschool and elementary students. Boys get it more often than girls. Doctors don’t know why, but it happens a lot in children who’ve had a virus. It may be a side effect of the body's fight against it. Your child’s pediatrician may prescribe anti-inflammatory medicine, sometimes with pain meds. Within a few weeks, they should feel better, without any lingering problems. Hip Dysplasia At baby well visits, doctors check the movements of your baby ’s hips. This is because in some babies, one or both hips didn't develop quite right. Some babies are born with the problem. Others have it after they’re born. It’s more common in girls. Doctors think the hormones babies get in the womb may relax the hips too much. It may be more common among kids born breech -- with their feet or hips first. A doctor may put your baby in a soft brace that keeps their knees bent for several months. This usually takes care of the problem. In rare cases, your child may need surgery. Arthritis Different kinds of it can cause hip pain in children. The most common type is juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). If your child has it, they may feel stiffness or have swelling in more than one joint. Their hips may be stiff as well. Your child may also have an unusual walk or have a fever for unknown reasons. Doctors aren’t sure what causes JIA, but it may be linked to a virus. It’s most common in children before they hit puberty . Doctors often treat it with medicine and physical therapy. Legg-Calve-Perthes Disease If the rounded top of the thighbone (femoral head) that fits into the hip socket (pelvis) doesn’t get enough blood , the bone is more likely to break. It also won’t heal as well as a healthy bone would. This can cause your child to limp or have stiffness and pain in the hip, knee, or thigh. Doctors don’t know why blood stops flowing to the hip joint in some children. It’s more common among kids up to age 8. Boys are more likely to have it. Doctors can treat it with crutches, a cast, physical therapy, or surgery. Having Legg-Calve-Perthes disease after age 6 makes someone more likely to have hip problems as an adult. Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis This is a fracture along the growth plate under the ball joint in the hip. It's kind of like ice cream falling off the cone. This causes pain, sometimes in the hip but other times in the thigh or knee. Sometimes, your child may need crutches. Other times, they can’t walk or move their leg because the pain is so severe. It’s more common in older children (from age 8 into teenage years) and those who are overweight . Boys get it more often. Surgery is a common treatment. Many children recover fully, but they’re more likely to have arthritis of the hip as adults. Infections A number of them can cause pain in your child’s hip. This may make them limp or give them trouble walking. One condition, called septic arthritis , can cause painful hip swelling and redness. It may be caused by bacteria (like a staph infection ), a virus, or even a fungus . Other bacterial infections or Lyme disease (which your child may get from the bite of an infected tick) can also cause hip pain. Antibiotics may be all that’s needed to treat some infections. Other times, your child may need a procedure to drain the infection from the joint. Other Causes Sometimes, an injury can cause hip pain. In rare cases, a tumor in the hip can cause it as well. When to See the Doctor If pain is severe or it stops your child from walking, take them to the doctor right away. Your child may need a blood test, X-ray, or MRI . Once the doctor figures out what’s causing the problem, they’ll offer a treatment."
30,What Happens When You Have a Hip Fracture?,"A hip fracture is a break in the top quarter of the thighbone, which is also called the femur. It can happen for lots of reasons and in many ways. Falls -- especially those to the side -- are among the most common causes. Some hip fractures are more serious than others, but most are treated with surgery. Who’s Most at Risk? Each year about 300,000 Americans -- most of them over age 65 -- break a hip. It happens to women more often than men. That’s because women fall more often and are more likely to have osteoporosis , a disease that makes bones weak. Other things that increase your chances of a hip fracture include: Being underweight Not getting enough calcium or vitamin D Family history of osteoporosis Lack of exercise Drinking too much alcohol Smoking Also, distance runners and ballet dancers sometimes develop thin cracks called stress fractures in their hips. They can grow bigger over time if they’re not treated. Hip Fracture Symptoms You’ll probably have a lot of pain in your hip or groin. You may be unable to walk. Your skin around the injury may also swell, get red or bruise . Some people with hip fractures can still walk. They might just complain of vague pain in their hips, butt, thighs, groin or back. If your doctor thinks you’ve got a broken hip, they’ll ask questions about any recent injuries or falls. They’ll do a physical exam and take X-rays. If the X-ray image is unclear, you may also need an MRI or bone scan . To do a bone scan, your doctor injects a very small amount of radioactive dye into a vein in your arm. The ink travels through your blood into your bones, where it can reveal fractures. Are Hip Fractures Dangerous? It depends. They can damage surrounding muscles, ligaments, tendons, blood vessels, and nerves. If they’re not treated right away, they could affect your ability to get around for long periods of time. When this happens, you run the risk of a number of complications, like: Blood clots in your legs or lungs Bedsores Urinary tract infection Pneumonia Loss of muscle mass. This puts you at risk for more falls and injuries. What’s the Treatment? Usually, you’ll need surgery. The type depends on the kind of fracture you have, your age, and your overall health. But first, your doctor will likely order a number of tests, like blood and urine, chest X-rays, and an electrocardiogram (EKG). How Can I Prevent a Hip Fracture? The best way is to make sure your bones stay strong and healthy. To that end, your doctor might recommend one or more of the following: Calcium supplements Vitamin D supplements Drugs called bisphosphonates – these prevent the loss of bone mass Regular physical activity Giving up tobacco and alcohol Your doctor may also recommend you take drugs that increase the activity of the hormone estrogen and improve bone density. These are called selective estrogen receptor modulators. The FDA has approved hip protector garments that can be worn by older people with osteoporosis . It’s thought they may help prevent hip fractures ."
31,What Is Hirschsprung's Disease?,"It’s a cycle that’s vital to life -- we eat food, digest it, and excrete what we can’t use. Excretion, though often a subject of disgust or humor, is very important. It usually begins on the first day of a baby ’s life, when the newborn passes their first stool, called the meconium. But some babies have trouble. If a baby can’t have a bowel movement , they may have Hirschsprung ’s disease, a condition in which there are missing nerve cells in the large intestine. Hirschsprung’s disease is congenital -- that is, it develops during pregnancy and is present at birth. Some congenital conditions happen because of the mother’s diet , or because of an illness they had during their pregnancy. Others are because of genes the parents pass on to the newborn . Researchers don’t know why some people have Hirschsprung’s disease, though they believe the disease is related to flaws in DNA instructions. Though the disease can be deadly, modern medicine is able to fix the problem with surgery, and help children who have been treated to live relatively normal, healthy lives. What Causes Hirschsprung’s Disease? It begins to take hold in a baby in the early months of pregnancy. Usually, as the baby develops, nerve cells are created throughout the entire digestive system , from the esophagus -- which leads from the mouth to the stomach -- all the way to the rectum. Normally, a person will have up to 500 million of these types of nerve cells. Among other roles, they move food through your digestive system from one end to the other. In a baby with Hirschsprung’s, the nerve cells stop growing at the end of the large intestine, just before the rectum and anus . In some children, the cells are missing at other places in the digestive system as well. That means the body can’t sense when waste material reaches a certain point. So the waste material gets stuck and forms a block in the system. Hirschsprung’s disease affects about one in every 5,000 newborns. Children with other congenital conditions, such as Down syndrome and heart defects, are more likely to have the disease. Parents who carry the code for Hirschsprung’s disease in their genes, especially mothers, may pass it on to their children. Boys get it more than girls. The disease is named after the 19 th -century Danish doctor Harald Hirschsprung, who described the condition in 1888. Symptoms For the vast majority of people with Hirschsprung’s disease, symptoms usually begin within the first 6 weeks of life. In many cases, there are signs within the first 48 hours. You may see swelling in your child’s abdomen . Other symptoms you might see include: No bowel movements: You should be concerned if the newborn does not produce a stool or the meconium in the first couple of days. Older children with Hirschsprung’s may have chronic (ongoing) constipation . Bloody diarrhea : Children with Hirschsprung’s may also get enterocolitis, a life-threatening infection of the colon , and have bad cases of diarrhea and gas . Vomiting : The vomit may be green or brown. In older children, symptoms may include growth issues, fatigue , and severe constipation . Diagnosis and Tests Your doctor should be told at once if your child has these symptoms. They can confirm Hirschsprung’s with some specific tests: A contrast enema: It’s also called a barium enema, after the element in the dye often used to coat and highlight the inside of the body’s organs. Your child is placed face-down on a table while the dye is inserted via a tube from the anus into the intestines . No anesthesia (a medication to numb or block pain ) is necessary. The dye allows the doctor to see problem areas on the X-rays. The contrast enema is done as part of what is called a “lower GI series,” a group of tests on the gastrointestinal tract. An abdominal X-ray: This is a standard X-ray, which the technician may take from several angles. Your doctor will be able to see whether something is blocking the intestines . A biopsy : Your doctor will take a small sample of tissue from your child’s rectum. The tissue will be looked at for signs of Hirschsprung’s. Depending on the age and size of your child, the doctor may use anesthesia. Anorectal manometry: This test inflates a small balloon inside the rectum to see whether the muscles of the area respond. This test is done only on older children. Treatments Hirschsprung’s disease is a very serious condition. But if found quickly, it can help your child live a relatively normal life. Doctors will usually do one of two types of surgery: Pull-through procedure: This surgery simply cuts out the part of the large intestine with the missing nerve cells. Then the rest of the intestine is connected directly to the anus. Ostomy surgery: This surgery routes the intestine to an opening made in the body. The doctor then attaches an ostomy bag to the outside of the opening to hold the waste from the intestine. Ostomy surgery is usually a temporary measure until the child is ready for the pull-through procedure. After surgery, some children may have issues with constipation , diarrhea, or incontinence (lack of control over bowel movements or urination). A handful may get enterocolitis. Signs include rectal bleeding , fever , vomiting , and a swollen abdomen. If that happens, take your child to the hospital at once. But with proper care -- especially a proper diet and plenty of water -- these conditions should subside and most children are able to experience normal bowel movements within a year of treatment. Other children will have bowel issues on and off into adulthood throughout their lives. Because Hirschsprung’s disease is congenital, it means it is a lifelong issue that should be monitored."
32,Hirsutism,"What Is Hirsutism? Hirsutism is a condition in women and people assigned female at birth (AFAB) in which you have a lot of hair growing in places where it usually does just for men. It can also affect men and people assigned male at birth (AMAB), but the condition is often harder  to identify. In men, hirsutism may look like typical hair growth. The hair is often dark and coarse instead of the light, fine “peach fuzz” that covers most of the body. About 5%-10% of women in the U.S. have hirsutism. Polycystic ovary syndrome, or PCOS, can cause hirsutism. (Photo Credit: Freemanhan2011/Dreamstime) Hypertrichosis Hypertrichosis also causes excess hair growth, but it’s a different condition than hirsutism. With hypertrichosis, excess hair grows anywhere on your body. On the other hand, people with hirsutism have a lot of hair growth on specific areas that depend on male hormones, such as the face, chest, back, and stomach. Symptoms of Hirsutism With hirsutism, extra hair will grow on your: Face Chest Lower stomach Inner thighs Back Virilization Virilization is a process in which women or people AFAB develop male traits. It can happen when people with hirsutism have high hormone levels. Signs of virilization include: A deep voice Balding Acne More muscle mass Smaller breasts An enlarged clitoris Causes of Hirsutism Hirsutism is caused by high levels of male hormones (called androgens). It's normal for women's bodies to make androgens, and low levels don't cause excess hair growth. But when these amounts are too high, they can cause hirsutism and other things, like acne, a deep voice, and small breasts. Sometimes, a person’s androgen levels may be normal, but their hair follicles are overly sensitive to male hormones. This is called follicle sensitivity, and it can also lead to hirsutism. Some possible reasons for high levels of androgens include: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which causes small cysts, or fluid-filled sacs, to form on your ovaries . Cushing's syndrome , which you get when you have high levels of the stress hormone cortisol for long periods of time. Tumors in your adrenal glands (which make hormones like cortisol) or your ovaries. Medication . Some drugs can change the hormone levels in your system, so you grow unwanted hair on your face or body. This can happen with: Drugs that have hormones, like anabolic steroids Drugs that spur hair growth, like minoxidil ( Rogaine ) A drug called danazol ( Danocrine ) that can help with endometriosis , when the tissue that lines the uterus grows outside the womb High insulin levels. Insulin can trigger the ovaries to produce androgens. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia is an inherited condition that can cause your adrenal glands to make too much androgen. Menopause. Hormone changes can happen after menopause. Some women and people AFAB have idiopathic hirsutism, which means there’s no known cause. Does hirsutism mean you have PCOS? PCOS is the most common cause of hirsutism. But hirsutism, by itself, doesn’t mean you have PCOS. Extra hair growth is simply a symptom of PCOS that affects up to 70% of women and people AFAB with the condition. Other signs of PCOS are: Irregular menstrual cycles Weight gain Thinning hair Acne Darkening of skin or skin tags Risk Factors for Hirsutism Women and people AFAB are most likely to develop hirsutism. A few other things can make hirsutism more likely, including: Family history. Some conditions that run in families and affect your hormones can cause hirsutism. Ancestry. People of Mediterranean, Hispanic, South Asian, or Middle Eastern descent are more likely to have extra body hair. Obesity. Being overweight causes your body to make more male hormones, which can make hirsutism worse. Hirsutism Diagnosis Your doctor will look at your hair growth and check for any other signs of hirsutism, like acne . They might rule out other conditions with tests including: Blood tests to check your hormone levels Ultrasound to look at your ovaries and uterus X-ray or CT scan to examine your adrenal glands MRI of the brain Once a diagnosis is made, your doctor might use something called the Ferriman-Gallwey scale. This tool helps them determine how severe your condition is by looking at hair growth in nine areas of your body. To calculate the Ferriman-Gallwey score, health providers use a scale that ranges from 0 to 4 for each body location. A lower score means your hirsutism is mild, while a higher core indicates a more severe condition. Treatments for Hirsutism If you have more facial or body hair than you want, there are a number of ways you can remove it: Weight loss . If you’re overweight and drop pounds, your body may make fewer male hormones. Shaving. You can remove unwanted hair easily with a razor or electric shaver. You may need to shave daily to avoid stubble growth. Some people get razor burn from shaving too often, but a soothing cream may help. Tweezing or threading. There are different ways to pluck hair out at the root. You can use tweezers. Or you can hire someone to “thread” – use a long, tight strand to loop around and remove each unwanted hair. These methods can cause pain and redness. Waxing. A quick way to remove lots of unwanted hair by the root is with melted wax. Often, you get this done in a salon. Wax is applied to the skin and then removed quickly. It can cause pain and redness. Creams. Some creams have strong chemicals called depilatories. You apply the cream and let it sit for a while, and when you wipe it off, the hair goes with it. They can irritate sensitive skin, so test a small spot before you use one on a large area. Electrolysis. You can remove hair for good with electrolysis, a service that zaps hair at the root with an electric current. After you repeat the process several times, hair should stop growing in treated areas. Laser hair removal . The heat from lasers removes hair at the root, but you need to repeat the process several times, and it sometimes grows back. Medication. Doctors can prescribe drugs that change the way your body grows hair. But when you stop using it, hair will grow back. Birth control pills make the body produce fewer male hormones. With regular use, you should have less hair on your face or body. Anti-androgens help your body make and use fewer male hormones. Eflornithine ( Vaniqa ) is a face cream that slows hair growth where you apply it. Bleaching products can lighten the hair on your body. Low-dose steroids may be prescribed if your adrenal glands are overactive. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists lower the amount of androgen that’s produced in the ovaries. They are injected and can be expensive. Insulin-lowering drugs , such as metformin (Glucophage) or pioglitazone (Actos), can also lower levels androgens in the blood. But because they can cause side effects, they usually aren’t used as a first-line treatment option. Complications of Hirsutism Hirsutism can cause emotional distress. People with the condition can have a poor self-image due to the unwanted hair. You may even have symptoms of depression or anxiety. Hirsutism Prevention You may be able to lessen your chances of getting hirsutism, depending on the cause. If you have PCOS, here are some ways to lower your risk: Eat a healthy, low-calorie diet Lose weight Exercise regularly Talk to your doctor if you take medicines that can cause hirsutism. You may be able to adjust some of these drugs. Takeaways Hirsutism causes excessive hair growth, mainly in women and people AFAB. Though the symptoms of this condition can feel embarrassing, there are treatments available if you want to lessen the amount of facial and body hair. Talk to your doctor if you think you might have hirsutism. Hirsutism FAQs What is the cause of hirsutism? Hirsutism is caused by too many male hormones (called androgens) in your body. Or, a hair follicle sensitivity to male hormones is another possible culprit. Various conditions can cause your body to make too many androgens. And sometimes, doctors don’t know why this happens. How do you get rid of hirsutism? There are treatments to help slow down your hair growth and lessen unwanted hair. But no therapies will make the hair completely go away. Can you ever get rid of hirsutism? If you have hirsutism, you will need continuing treatment if you want to address your symptoms. Most people find an effective therapy that they can use as a long-term fix."
33,What Is Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis?,"You may know that white blood cells are your body’s infection fighters. But if your body makes too much of a type of immune cell called histiocytes, they can cause tumors, lesions, and other tissue damage. One of these rare disorders -- which resembles some types of cancer -- is called Langerhans cell histiocytosis, or LCH. It most commonly appears in toddlers and very young children, but you can have it as an adult, too. Symptoms LCH can show up on many places on your body, but most often on your skin and bones. It can affect any organ, including your lungs , liver , brain , spleen , or lymph nodes . In about 8 out of 10 people, LCH leads to tumors called granulomas in the skull and in other bones. That can cause pain and swelling, and sometimes it can fracture your arms or legs. LCH symptoms can range from mild to more serious. Some people are born with it, and the disease eventually goes away on its own. But others have a severe and long-lasting type that affects multiple parts of the body. Along with your bones, it can affect your: Skin. Red, scaly bumps in skin folds are common. Infants with LCH can get red, scaly scalps, which is often mistaken for cradle cap , a common skin condition. Liver . Usually, only severe cases of LCH affect the liver. Your skin might appear jaundiced, or yellow, and your blood can take longer to clot. Lymph nodes. These glands, which are behind the ears , in the neck, and in other places, can swell up. You also might have trouble breathing or have coughs . Diagnosis Your doctor will know if you have LCH after a tissue biopsy . That’s when a specialist called a pathologist views the sample under a microscope for specific proteins and other markers of the disease. In addition to the physical exam , your doctors may order other tests based on your symptoms: X-rays of your lungs and bones Bone marrow biopsy to look for signs of LCH Blood chemistry test to check your kidneys , liver , thyroid , and immune system MRIs and PET and CT scans to get detailed images of your body Urinalysis to check levels of red and white cells, protein, and sugar in your pee Causes We don’t know all the reasons why some people get LCH. About half of the people with the disorder have a faulty gene that makes the Langerhans immune cells grow out of control. That genetic mutation happens after birth, which means you usually won’t get LCH from your parents. Researchers suspect that other things may also play a role: Smoking Parents who were exposed to environmental toxins, like benzene or wood dust Infections as a newborn Family history of thyroid disease Treatments As with some types of cancer , doctors sometimes treat LCH with chemotherapy . Many people with the disorder get care from cancer specialists like oncologists and hematologists. But unlike most cancers, limited forms of LCH sometimes spontaneously go away on their own. Beside chemotherapy, options for treatment include: Low-dose radiation to targeted part of the body Surgery to remove LCH lesions Steroids like prednisone or anti-inflammatory drugs Ultraviolet light therapy for skin conditions Stem cell transplant Bone marrow, liver, or lung transplants in very serious cases A great majority of people with LCH recover with treatment. If the disease is in your spleen, liver, or bone marrow, it’s called a high-risk LCH. About 80% of people with that type survive."
34,Hives and Your Skin,"Urticaria, also known as hives, is an outbreak of pale red bumps or welts on the skin that appear suddenly. The swelling that often comes with hives is called angioedema. Allergic reactions, chemicals in certain foods, insect stings, sunlight, and medications can cause hives. It's often impossible to find out exactly why hives have formed. What Causes Hives? There are several types of hives, including: Acute urticaria. These are hives that last less than 6 weeks. The most common causes are foods, medications, and infections. Insect bites and diseases may also be responsible. The most common foods that cause hives are nuts, chocolate, fish, tomatoes, eggs, fresh berries, and milk. Fresh foods cause hives more often than cooked foods. Certain food additives and preservatives may also be to blame. Drugs that can cause hives include aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications such as ibuprofen, high blood pressure drugs (especially ACE inhibitors), or painkillers such as codeine. Chronic urticaria. These are hives that last more than 6 weeks. The cause is usually harder to identify than those causing acute urticaria. For most people with chronic urticaria, the cause is impossible to find. In some cases, though, the cause may be thyroid , hepatitis, infection, or cancer. Chronic urticaria can also affect organs such as the lungs, muscles, and gastrointestinal tract. Symptoms include shortness of breath, muscle soreness, vomitin g , and diarrhea. Physical urticaria. These hives are caused by something that stimulates the skin -- for example, cold, heat, sun exposure, vibration, pressure, sweating, or exercise. The hives usually occur right where the skin was stimulated and rarely appear elsewhere. Most of the hives appear within 1 hour. Dermatographism. This is a common form of physical urticaria where hives form after firmly stroking or scratching the skin. These hives can also occur along with other forms of urticaria. The Link to Contact Dermatitis Contact dermatitis is a painful or itchy rash you get after your skin touches something you're allergic to (allergic contact dermatitis) or that's otherwise irritating to your skin (irritant contact dermatitis). It's not the same as hives. But sometimes people with contact dermatitis also get hives after they come into contact with an allergen. How Are Hives Diagnosed? Your doctor will need to ask many questions in an attempt to find the possible cause of hives. Since there are no specific tests for hives -- or the associated swelling of angioedema -- testing will depend on your medical history and a thorough exam by your doctor. Your doctor may do skin tests to find out what you're allergic to. Or they may test your blood to see if you have an illness. How Are Hives Treated? The best treatment for hives is to find and remove the trigger, but this is not an easy task. Antihistamines are usually prescribed by your doctor to provide relief from symptoms. Antihistamines work best if taken on a regular schedule to prevent hives from forming in the first place. Chronic hives may be treated with antihistamines or a combination of medications. When antihistamines don't provide relief, oral steroids may be prescribed. A biologic drug, omalizumab (Xolair), is also approved to treat chronic hives in people at least 12 years old. For severe hives, you might need an injection of epinephrine or a cortisone medication. How Can Hives Be Managed? While you're waiting for hives and swelling to disappear, here are some tips: Apply cool compresses or wet cloths to the affected areas. Try to work and sleep in a cool room. Wear loose-fitting lightweight clothes. When Should I Call the Doctor About Hives? If you have hives with any of the following symptoms, contact your doctor right away: Dizziness Wheezing Difficulty breathing Tightness in the chest Swelling of the tongue, lips, or face"
35,What Is Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome?,"Sometimes during pregnancy, the left side of a baby's heart doesn't grow the way it should. This causes a rare defect called hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS). About 1,000 babies are born with it in the U.S. each year. Normally, the right side of your heart pumps blood from your heart to your lungs where it gets oxygen. After it goes back to your heart, the left side then pumps the oxygen-rich blood to the rest of your body. The heart of a baby with HLHS can't do this. The lower left chamber may be smaller than normal or not there at all. The valves on the left side may not work right or the main artery leaving the heart may not be as big as it should be. A baby with HLHS also may have a hole between the left and right upper chamber of their heart. This is called an atrial septal defect, and it can cause too much blood to flow to the lungs . Signs of HLHS may not show up until a few days after birth. For the first day or two, a baby's heart can adjust to the defect. If the left side of the heart can't pump blood very well to the rest of the body, the right side will do more work. But the adjustment only lasts a few days. A newborn has a blood vessel that connects the two sides of their heart. It's called the patent ductus arteriosus, and it stays open for only a few days after birth. After that, it naturally closes. This is when most babies with the defect start to show symptoms from the lack of oxygen-rich blood and overworked heart. Cause Doctors don't know why HLHS happens, but it does run in families. Some experts think that what the mother eats, drinks, or comes into contact with during pregnancy may also increase the risk that their baby will have HLHS. This might include smoking or drinking alcohol or not taking a prenatal vitamin with folic acid . Symptoms and Diagnosis Heart defects can show up on an ultrasound during the second trimester of pregnancy. So some parents find out about it before their babies are born. In other cases, HLHS is found a few days after the baby's born. The signs include: Being sleepy or not wanting to move Cold hands and feet Fast breathing or difficulty breathing Gray or blue skin Not eating well When your doctor listens to your baby's heartbeat, they may hear a heart murmur, which sounds like a whooshing noise. This happens because of the unusual blood flow HLHS causes. If your doctor thinks your baby might have HLHS, they'll order an echocardiogram. This test uses sound waves to make images of their heart on a video screen. It can show the chambers of the heart and track blood flow. Treatment It's important that HLHS is diagnosed and treated right away. If not, your baby's organs won't get enough blood. That can make them go into shock. Treatments include: Medicine: Your baby may be given a drug called alprostadil (Prostin VR Pediatric) to help keep the ductus arteriosus open. They may also need medicine to make their heart muscle stronger, lower blood pressure , and help their body get rid of extra fluids. Help with feeding and breathing: Your baby will be weak and will likely need to get fluids through an IV or a feeding tube. A breathing machine called a ventilator may also be used to make sure your baby gets enough oxygen. Atrial septostomy. If your baby doesn't have an atrial septal defect, your doctor may recommend this surgery. It creates an opening between the heart's upper chambers to let more blood flow through. A baby with HLHS also may go through a series of surgeries to help repair their heart. The first, called the Norwood procedure, is done soon after birth. It's a complicated surgery that makes a new aorta for your baby and lets the right ventricle of the heart pump all the blood to the body (after the ductus closes). Two other surgeries to rebuild the heart and let blood flow the right way usually follow. The timing depends on your child's condition, but the next surgery, known as the Glenn, is usually done when your baby is a few months old. The third surgery is called the Fontan procedure and happens when they are 3 or 4 years old. In some cases, your doctor may suggest a heart transplant. This will give your child a healthy heart, but it can take time to find a donor. They'll also need to take medicine for the rest of their life so their body doesn't reject it. Outlook Your child will need lifelong care from a heart doctor (cardiologist) who specializes in birth defects. Your child also probably will need more surgery, and there's a good chance that they may have other heart problems, such as irregular heart rhythms and blood clots . An infant who has surgery to rebuild their heart may grow up physically weaker than other kids and could have some development issues. They may need extra support at home and school."
36,Understanding Hodgkin Lymphoma -- the Basics,"What Is Hodgkin Lymphoma? Hodgkin lymphoma, also known as Hodgkin's disease , is a type of lymphoma , a cancer of the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system is a network of nodes (knots of tissue) connected by vessels that drain fluid and waste products from the body. The lymph nodes act as tiny filters, straining out foreign organisms and cells. The lymphatic system also is involved in producing important white blood cells called lymphocytes that help protect you against various infections caused by bacteria, viruses, and fungi. When the lymphatic system is fighting an active infection, you may notice that some of your lymph nodes and tissue in the area of the infection become swollen and tender. This is the body's normal reaction to infection. Lymphoma occurs when the lymph node cells or the lymphocytes begin to multiply uncontrollably, producing malignant cells that have the abnormal ability to invade other tissues throughout your body. The two main types of lymphoma are Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which are classified by certain unique characteristics of the cancer cells. Hodgkin disease is most common in two different age groups: young adults (ages 15 to 35) and older adults (over age 50). It is somewhat more common in males than females, and more common in Caucasians than in African-Americans. Because of progress in treating Hodgkin lymphoma, most people with a diagnosis of Hodgkin lymphoma will be long-time survivors. What Causes Hodgkin Lymphoma? The exact cause of Hodgkin lymphoma is not known, but the following have been implicated: Viruses: The Epstein-Barr virus, the same virus that causes infectious mononucleosis (mono), has been implicated as a cause of Hodgkin lymphoma. The presence of the genome of this virus is seen in 20%-80% of Hodgkin lymphoma tumors. Familial : Same-sex siblings and an identical twin of a person with Hodgkin lymphoma are at high risk of developing the disease. Children with a parent who has Hodgkin are also at an increased risk. Environment: Fewer siblings, early birth order, single-family homes, and fewer playmates are associated with an increased risk of developing Hodgkin lymphoma -- possibly due to a lack of exposure to bacterial and viral infections at an early age."
37,Ventricular Septal Defect,"Ventricular Septal Defect Overview Ventricular septal defect is a hole in the wall between the right and left ventricles of the heart . This abnormality usually develops before birth and is found most often in infants. The ventricles are the 2 lower chambers of the heart. The wall between them is called the septum. A hole in the septum is called a septal defect. If the hole is located between the upper chambers or atria, it is called an atrial septal defect. Infants may be born with either or both types of defects. These conditions are commonly known as ""holes in the heart."" Normally, deoxygenated blood from the body returns to the upper chamber of the right side of the heart called the right atrium.  It passes through the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle, which pumps the blood to the lungs to absorb oxygen. After leaving the lungs, the oxygenated blood returns to the left side of the heart, to the left atrium.  It then passes through the mitral valve into the left ventricle, where it is pumped out to provide oxygen to all the tissues of the body. A ventricular septal defect can allow newly oxygenated blood to flow from the left ventricle, where the pressures are higher, to the right ventricle, where the pressures are lower, and mix with deoxygenated blood. The mixed blood in the right ventricle flows back or recirculates into the lungs. This means that the right and left ventricles are working harder, pumping a greater volume of blood than they normally would. Eventually, the left ventricle can work so hard that it starts to fail. It can no longer pump blood as well as it did previously. Blood returning to the left side of the heart may back up into the lungs, causing pulmonary congestion, and blood returning the right side of the heart may further back up into the body, causing weight gain and fluid retention. Overall, this is called congestive heart failure . If the VSD is large and surgically uncorrected, pressure can build excessively in the lungs, called pulmonary hypertension . The higher the lung or pulmonary pressure, the greater the chance of blood flowing from the right ventricle through the VSD to the left ventricle, causing deoxygenated blood to be pumped out to the body by the left ventricle, causing cyanosis (blue skin ). The risk for these problems depends on the size of the hole in the septum and how well the infant ’s lungs function. The ventricular septal defect may not be heard with a stethoscope until several days after birth. This is because a newborn's circulatory system changes during the first week, with a drop in the lung or pulmonary pressure creating the greater pressure differential between the 2 ventricles, which may increase the left-to-right shunt and produce an audible murmur. Ventricular septal defects are the most common congenital heart defects in infants The condition occurs in about 25% of all infants born with a heart defect. These defects are more common in premature infants. Ventricular Septal Defect Causes No one knows what causes ventricular septal defects, but they probably come from a malformation of the heart that occurs while the infant is developing in the womb. There may be just one hole or several holes in the septum. The septum itself is divided into multiple areas, including the membranous part, the muscular part, and other areas called the inlet and outlet. Any or all of these parts can have a hole. The location of the hole depends on where the malformation takes place during fetal development . The most common type of ventricular septal defect is the membranous variant. In this type, the hole is located below the aortic valve, which controls flow of blood from the left ventricle into the main artery of the body, the aorta. Ventricular Septal Defect Symptoms Small holes in the ventricular septum usually produce no symptoms but are often recognized by the child's health care provider when a loud heart murmur along the left side of the lower breast bone or sternum is heard. Large holes typically produce symptoms 1-6 months after an infant’s birth. The left ventricle begins to fail, producing the following symptoms: Fast breathing Sweating Pallor Very fast heartbeatsDecreased feeding Poor weight gain When a ventricular septal defect is not detected early in life, it can cause more severe problems and more severe symptoms as time goes on. The biggest concern is development of high pressure in the lungs (pulmonary hypertension). If the ventricular septal defect is not surgically closed, irreversible pulmonary hypertension can develop, and the child may no longer benefit from surgery. The following are typical symptoms of pulmonary hypertension: Fainting Shortness of breath Chest pain Bluish discoloration of the skin (cyanosis) The skin turns faintly bluish when the tissues are not receiving quite enough oxygen. This condition is often termed ""hypoxemia"" or ""hypoxia."" When to Seek Medical Care Any of the following should be reported to your child's health care provider: Poor weight gain or slowing of weight gain in the first months of life Unusual behavior Any of the other symptoms noted in the previous section An immediate visit to the nearest hospital emergency department is warranted if you notice any of the following in your infant: Shortness of breath, breathing difficulty of any type, or worsening of an existing breathing problem Bluish color of the skin, lips, or under the nails Unusual or unexplained sweating Exams and Tests If a ventricular septal defect is noted before your baby leaves the hospital, several tests may be ordered before discharge. An echocardiogram (an ultrasound picture of the heart), a chest X-ray , and blood tests may be taken. You will be asked to follow up with your child's primary care provider, and you will have to watch closely for signs and symptoms that suggest congestive heart failure or hypoxia. A ventricular septal defect is detected on physical examination by a systolic murmur audible with a stethoscope along the lower left sternal or breast bone border. It is related to the oxygenated blood “swishing” through the hole or VSD into the right ventricle. The presence of a hole in the heart can be confirmed by echocardiogram. This painless test uses ultrasound waves to construct a moving picture of the heart. It can quantitate the size of the left-to-right shunt by enlargement of the left ventricle, pressure in the lungs, and actually estimate the degree of shunting by an empirical formula. Chest X-ray is useful to see if the overall heart size is enlarged, and may demonstrate evidence of fluid in the lungs or pulmonary congestion. An electrocardiogram is helpful to evaluate the sizes of the left and right ventricle.  If right ventricular hypertrophy is indicated, this may suggest pulmonary hypertension. Cardiac catheterization may be performed in certain circumstances. In this procedure, a very thin plastic tube called a catheter is inserted into the skin in the groin, arm, or neck (under local anesthesia with minimal pain) and advanced to the heart under X-ray observation by the cardiologist. Pressures are measured inside the heart, especially if any concern was previously raised over the degree of pulmonary hypertension and therefore operability. If the lung pressures are very high and won’t drop with oxygen and additional vasodilating drugs , the patient may not be operable. If additional abnormalities are possible, a dye study may be performed to visualize the anatomy of inside the heart. But the echocardiogram may accomplish this goal in the majority of patients. Ventricular Septal Defect Treatment In some children with ventricular septal defect, the defect will close on its own as the child grows. Medical Treatment If a larger ventricular septal defect is causing symptoms, your child's health care provider may prescribe medication. Which medication is prescribed depends on the severity of symptoms. The goal of therapy is to reduce the symptoms of congestive heart failure, such as poor growth and development, weight loss and/or poor weight gain, excessive sweating, and fast breathing. An older patient typically develops fluid in the lungs, liver , and legs. Routine antibiotic use is warranted for dental surgery and any invasive procedure if any VSD is still present after closure. Medications Vasodilators: Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers are used to decrease the work load on the left ventricle. Digoxin ( Lanoxin) increases the strength of the heart muscle to deal with the greater blood volume. Diuretics such as Lasix (furosemide) or spironolactone help remove excess fluid from the body so the heart doesn't have to work as hard and the patient feels much better. Surgery Larger ventricular septal defects do not close as the child grows. If it does not close, closing the heart surgically is necessary. Surgical closure is typically done before the child begins preschool. Surgery is indicated if medications do not work in the first few months or years of life, especially if the child is not growing adequately even with medications. Surgery is more urgent if evidence of pulmonary hypertension has developed. The most used operation involves placing a Gore-Tex patch over the hole. This prevents shunting (the movement of oxygenated blood from the left to the right ventricle). Surgery is not usually performed in newborns because small defects will close spontaneously in 20%-25% of cases. The surgery also is more risky in the first few months of life; the risk of death from the operation is higher in the first 6 months of life. Doctors are also using devices that cover the defect, performed in the cardiac catheterization laboratory, not by open heart surgery. Next Steps - Follow-Up Regular office visits and echocardiograms are required to continually reassess the ventricular septal defect. The child's weight and length/height will be checked often. Feeding and activity levels should be assessed routinely. Routine antibiotic use is warranted for dental surgery and any invasive procedure. Prevention Women can do nothing during pregnancy to prevent their babies from developing a ventricular septal defect. Outlook During the growth of a child, the defect may become smaller and close on its own. Twenty to 25% of all ventricular septal defects close by age 3 without medical intervention. Children who show no symptoms and are being monitored by a primary care provider do not have to restrict their activities. Children with mild-to-moderate shunting of blood may have to reduce their levels of activity. Once a defect is repaired, there are no restrictions on activity. Several other conditions may result from ventricular septal defects. Aortic regurgitation: Blood flowing backward from the aorta into the left ventricle. Endocarditis: An infection of the heart valves due to abnormal blood flow. Because endocarditis is always possible, medical professionals may recommend that children with certain types of ventricular septal defects receive antibiotics before undergoing dental procedures or surgery. Pulmonary hypertension: An increase in pressure in the right side of the heart and in the arteries of the lungs. This is caused by the shunting of blood from the left to the right ventricle, which increases the pressure in the right ventricle.

38,How and When to Test Your Blood Sugar With Diabetes,"Testing Blood Sugar Most people with diabetes should test their blood sugar (aka blood glucose) levels regularly. Knowing the results lets you adjust your strategy for keeping the disease in check. Regular testing can also help you avoid getting long-term health problems that can stem from the condition, like: Heart disease Stroke High blood pressure High cholesterol Blindness Kidney disease Skin problems Research shows that in people with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes, sticking to your target blood sugar and HbA1c levels makes complications less likely. There are several ways to test your blood sugar: From your fingertip: You prick your finger with a small, sharp needle (called a lancet) and put a drop of blood on a test strip. Then you put the test strip into a meter that shows your blood sugar level. You get results in less than 15 seconds and can store this information for future use. Some meters can tell you your average blood sugar level over a period of time and show you charts and graphs of your past test results. You can get blood sugar meters and strips at your local pharmacy. Meters that test other sites: Newer meters let you test sites other than your fingertip, such as your upper arm, forearm, base of the thumb, and thigh. You may get different results than from your fingertip. Blood sugar levels in the fingertips show changes more quickly than those in other testing sites. This is especially true when your blood sugar is rapidly changing, like after a meal or after exercise. If you are checking your sugar when you have symptoms of hypoglycemia , you should use your fingertip if possible, because these readings will be more accurate. Continuous glucose monitoring system: These devices, also called interstitial glucose measuring devices, are combined with insulin pumps. They are similar to finger-stick glucose results and can show patterns and trends in your results over time. When to Test Blood Sugar You may need to check your blood sugar several times a day, such as before meals or exercise, at bedtime, before driving, and when you think your blood sugar levels are low. Everyone is different, so ask your doctor when and how often you should check your blood sugar. If you're sick, you'll probably need to test your blood sugar more often. What Affects Your Results If you have certain conditions, like anemia or gout, or if it's hot or humid or you're at a high altitude, that can affect your blood sugar levels. If you keep seeing unusual results, recalibrate your meter and check the test strips. The chart below gives you an idea of where your blood sugar level should be throughout the day. Your ideal blood sugar range may be different from another person's and will change throughout the day. Time of Test Ideal for Adults With Diabetes Before meals 70-130 mg/dL After meals Less than 180 mg/dL Home Blood Glucose Monitoring and HbA1c Monitoring your HbA1c level is also important for diabetes control. Many home glucose monitors can display an average blood glucose reading, which correlates with the HbA1c. Average Blood Glucose Level (mg/dL) HbA1c (%) 126 6 154 7 183 8 212 9 240 10 269 11 298 12 When Should I Call My Doctor About My Blood Sugar? Ask your doctor about your target blood sugar range, and make a plan for how to handle blood sugar readings that are either too high or too low and when to call your doctor. Learn about the symptoms of high or low blood sugar , and know what you can do if you begin to have symptoms. How Do I Record My Blood Sugar Test Results? Keep good records of any blood, urine, or ketone tests you do. Most glucose monitors also have a memory. Your records can alert you to any problems or trends. These test records help your doctor make any needed changes in your meal plan, medicine, or exercise program. Bring these records with you every time you see your doctor."
39,Does My Child Have Blood Sugar Problems?,"Most of us don't check our kid's blood sugar . So, chances are you don't know if it's healthy. Still, there may be clues that your child's levels are out of whack, and you may want to give your pediatrician a call. Signs of High Blood Sugar If your youngster just had an ice cream sundae, you could probably guess that their blood sugar is high. You might be right. But if they're healthy, their levels will quickly get back to normal. So that kind of spike isn't really a problem. If their blood sugar levels stay up no matter what they have to eat, that's cause for concern. It could signal diabetes . Tip-offs that your child's blood sugar level may be too high include: Constant trips to the bathroom: If it seems like they have to pee all the time, it might be because their body is trying to flush out extra glucose. Extreme thirst: If your youngster is peeing a lot, they're losing a lot of fluids. They may try to get them back by drinking more than usual. Weight loss despite a big appetite: If your child is having trouble using glucose the right way, their body may start breaking down muscle and fat for energy. Feeling tired , moody, or irritable: A tyke that's too tired to play could literally be lacking energy, since their body isn't getting the fuel it needs. Vision problems: High blood sugar can pull fluid from the eye , making it hard to focus. Yeast infections : Yeast thrives on sugar , which may lead to infections in girls and diaper rashes in babies. Signs of Low Blood Sugar You might assume that lower blood sugar is better than high. That's true, but only up to a certain point: If blood sugar goes too low, it means your child won't have enough fuel. If it gets really low (your doctor may call it hypoglycemia ), your child could have a seizure or even develop brain damage . A child who doesn't have diabetes might have an episode of hypoglycemia because they skipped lunch before soccer practice. It's also possible that a medicine your child takes raises their chances of having low blood sugar. They also could have been born with a condition that affects their metabolism . In any case, unless the cause is clear-cut (like not eating before being active), you should have your child's pediatrician investigate. If your child has low blood sugar , you may notice: Pale or gray skin Moodiness Clumsiness Confusion Your child might tell you that they: Feels shaky or dizzy Gets headaches Struggles to see clearly Sweats even when they're not active Is hungry a lot The skin around their mouth might also tingle, and it might feel like their heart is racing. Severe hypoglycemia can make your child pass out. If that, or a seizure, happens, call for medical help right away."
40,Gestational Diabetes,"What Is Gestational Diabetes? Gestational diabetes is a condition in which your blood sugar levels become high during pregnancy. It affects up to 10% of women who are pregnant in the U.S. each year. It affects pregnant people who haven’t ever been diagnosed with diabetes. There are two classes of gestational diabetes. Those with class A1 can manage it through diet and exercise. Those who have class A2 need to take insulin or other medications. Gestational diabetes goes away after you give birth. But it can affect your baby’s health, and it raises your risk of getting type 2 diabetes later in life. You can take steps so you and your baby stay healthy. Gestational Diabetes Symptoms If you have gestational diabetes, you usually don’t have symptoms or might chalk them up to pregnancy . Most find out that they have it during a routine screening. You may notice that: You’re thirstier than usual You’re hungrier and eat more than usual You pee more than usual Normal Blood Sugar Levels During Pregnancy: Chart Gestational Diabetes Causes When you eat, your pancreas releases insulin, a hormone that helps move a sugar called glucose from your blood to your cells, which use it for energy. During pregnancy, your placenta makes hormones that cause glucose to build up in your blood. Usually, your pancreas can send out enough insulin to handle it. But if your body can’t make enough insulin or stops using insulin as it should, your blood sugar levels rise, and you get gestational diabetes. Gestational Diabetes Risk Factors You’re more likely to get gestational diabetes if you: Were overweight before you got pregnant Are Black, Asian, Hispanic or Latinx, Alaska Native, Pacific Islander, or Native American Have blood sugar levels that are higher than they should be but not high enough to be diabetes (this is called prediabetes) Have a family member with diabetes Have had gestational diabetes before Have polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or another health condition linked to problems with insulin Have high blood pressure, high cholesterol, heart disease, or other medical complications Have given birth to a large baby (weighing more than 9 pounds) Have had a miscarriage Have given birth to a baby who was stillborn or had certain birth defects Are older than 25 Gestational Diabetes Tests and Diagnosis Gestational diabetes usually happens in the second half of pregnancy. Your doctor will check for it between weeks 24 and 28, or sooner if you're at high risk. Your doctor will give you a glucose tolerance test: You’ll drink 50 grams of glucose in a sweet drink, which will raise your blood sugar. An hour later, you’ll take a blood glucose test to see how your body handled all that sugar. If the results show that your blood sugar is higher than a certain level, you’ll need a 3-hour oral glucose tolerance test. For this test, you’ll take a blood glucose test after you have fasted for at least 8 hours (your doctor’s office will tell you exactly how long to fast for) and then drink a beverage containing 100 grams of glucose. After that, you’ll take a blood glucose test every hour for the next 3 hours. Your doctor can also test you by having you fast for at least 8 hours, take a blood glucose test, drink a drink containing 75 grams of glucose, and then take a blood glucose test once an hour for the next 2 hours. If you’re at high risk but your test results are normal, your doctor might test you again later in your pregnancy to make sure you still don’t have it. Gestational Diabetes Treatment If you have gestational diabetes, you’ll need treatment as soon as possible to keep yourself and your baby healthy during your pregnancy and delivery. Your doctor will ask you to: Check your blood sugar levels four or more times a day Check your urine for ketones , chemicals that mean that your diabetes isn’t under control Eat a healthy diet Make exercise a habit Your doctor will keep track of your weight and your baby’s development. They might give you insulin or another medicine to keep your blood sugar under control. Target Blood Sugar Levels for Women During Pregnancy The American Diabetes Association recommends these targets for pregnant women who test their blood sugar: Before a meal: 95 mg/dL or less An hour after a meal: 140 mg/dL or less Two hours after a meal: 120 mg/dL or less Diet and Exercise for Gestational Diabetes Take these simple steps to stay well: Eat a healthy, low-sugar diet. Talk to your doctor to be sure you’re getting the nutrition you need. Follow a meal plan made for someone with diabetes : Trade sugary snacks like cookies, candy, and ice cream for natural sugars like fruits, carrots, and raisins. Add vegetables and whole grains, and watch your portion sizes. Have three small meals along with two or three snacks about the same times every day. Get 40% of your daily calories from carbs and 20% from protein. Most of the carbs should be complex, high-fiber carbs, with fat being between 25% and 40%. Aim for 20-35 grams of fiber a day. Foods such as whole-grain breads, cereals, and pasta; brown or wild rice; oatmeal; and vegetables and fruits will help get you there. Limit your total fat to less than 40% of your daily calories. Saturated fat should be less than 10% of all the calories you eat. Eat a variety of foods to make sure you get enough vitamins and minerals. You may need to take a supplement to cover your bases. Ask your doctor if they think you should take one. Exercise throughout your pregnancy. You can exercise when you have gestational diabetes as long as your doctor says it’s OK. Being active is a good way to help manage your blood sugar. Staying fit during pregnancy is also good for your posture and can curb some common problems, like backaches and fatigue. Get active as soon as possible. Aim for 30 minutes of moderate activity most days of the week. Running, walking, swimming, and biking are good options. If you are not active now, start slowly and build up to 30 minutes a day. Was there a workout that you were doing before you found out you were pregnant? Do you have an activity that you love? Check with your doctor to see if you can keep it up, if you should make some changes, or if it's better to try something else. Exercise can lower your blood sugar. So when you work out, always have a form of quick sugar with you, such as glucose tablets or hard candy. Get the right prenatal care: Your doctor can check to see if you have gestational diabetes and offer advice on food, activity, and weight loss. They can also point you to other health professionals, like nutritionists, that can help. If you have morning sickness, eat small snacks. Nibble on crackers, cereal, or pretzels before you get out of bed. As you go through your day, have small meals often and avoid fatty, fried, and greasy foods. If you take insulin, make sure you've got a plan to deal with low blood sugar. Throwing up can make your glucose level drop. Talk to your doctor if you're not sure what to do. Gestational Diabetes Prevention You can lower your risk before you get pregnant by: Eating a healthy diet Staying active Losing extra weight Will Gestational Diabetes Affect My Baby? Your baby will probably be healthy if you and your doctor manage your blood sugar while you have gestational diabetes. Right after you give birth, doctors will check your newborn's blood sugar level. If it’s low, your baby may need to get glucose through an IV until it comes back up to normal. Gestational diabetes raises the chance that your baby will be larger than normal. It's also linked to jaundice, in which the skin looks yellowish. Jaundice generally fades quickly with treatment. Although your child will be more likely than other kids to get type 2 diabetes later on, a healthy lifestyle (including a good diet and lots of physical activity) can cut that risk. Will I Get Type 2 Diabetes? Because you had gestational diabetes, you have a greater chance of having type 2 diabetes. But it won’t definitely happen, and you can take action to prevent that. Your blood sugar levels will likely return to normal about 6 weeks after childbirth. (Your doctor will check on that.) If it does, you should get follow-up tests at least every 3 years; your doctor may recommend yearly testing. To lower your risk: Try to keep your weight in a healthy range. Not sure what that is? Ask your doctor. Eat a good diet that includes lots of vegetables, whole grains, fruits, and lean protein . Make exercise a habit. If you plan to have another baby, keep in mind that you are more likely to get gestational diabetes again. Ask your doctor if there are any lifestyle changes that would help you avoid that."
41,"Caring for Parents, Keeping Them Healthy","Sound Body, Sound Mind When caring for an older adult, it's important not to overlook routine care -- stuff that seems obvious but that may not be on your radar. Here is a rundown of what to keep in mind. Everyone needs regular checkups. But some older adults (and young ones, too) reason that since they just saw the doctor last month about that sinus problem, they don't need to go again. A visit to the doctor for a specific problem, however, doesn't take the place of a complete checkup. Make sure your parent is eating a balanced diet. Accompany them to the market to guide shopping choices, teach how to read labels, and discuss the importance of all the food groups, vitamins, fiber, and calcium . ID jewelry with pertinent medical alert and contact information should be worn by all older adults. There is a huge variety of bracelets, pendants, and even watchbands available. One company that sells them is American Medical Identifications . Know your mother's baseline -- what's ""normal"" for them. Some older adults have a lower normal body temperature than 98.6 degrees Farenheit, and others have had chronic problems throughout their lives. Be familiar with Mom's ""default setting,"" and be aware of changes. Know that baselines change as a person ages. If, for instance, they go through surgery, chances are they will come out of it with a new baseline. Know your loved one's complete medical history and keep a record of it to be taken to doctor's appointments and checked often. Just as important is to know your own medical history, in case genetic issues arise or transplants or transfusions become necessary. Unless told otherwise by your doctor, you should each be drinking eight glasses of water a day. Did you know that dehydration is a common cause of many disorders in older adults, including circulation problems? Make sure liquids are available all day long. How about an attractive thermos for the bedside or a water cooler in the living room and on the patio? Get one on casters so it can be moved from room to room. Blood pressure is an issue among most older adults. Get a reliable sphygmomanometer (a blood pressure monitor) and teach your loved one -- and yourself -- to take blood pressure readings . Some pharmacies take blood pressure readings and teach you to do it yourself for free. Local community service organizations such as the Kiwanis or Lions Club often offer free eye exams and eyeglasses to older adults who can't easily afford them. Your Area Agency on Aging will tell you what's available in your area. Free dental care is available from local dental schools, and often, a low income is not even a requirement. Contact the dental college in your area. Keep a diary of your parent's health progress. If your loved one is running a temperature or experiencing any other condition that may require a doctor's care, keep hourly notes and temperature readings for later reference. Wash your hands often when caring for your parents. Remind them to wash theirs, too. Keep plenty of moisturizer around. Dry, chapped hands are especially common in winter. When you visit department stores, ask the people at the cosmetics counters for free samples, and keep these around the house to be used often. Even natural supplements can sometimes be a bad mix with certain medications or cause side effects on their own. Ask your mom if they are taking anything like herbs or other supplements . Check them out with their doctor, no matter how harmless you believe they are. Foot massagers are great for promoting blood circulation and avoiding cracked heals, which can sometimes split. This is especially important in people with diabetes. A digital thermometer is easier to use than a mercury thermometer. Take temperatures using the armpit if your parent has breathing problems or is easily confused. If Mom has breathing problems and uses an inhaler, keep several around your house and hers, in the car, and so forth. Many trips to the bathroom may indicate a urinary tract infection , common among older people who don't always get the fluids they need. Consult a doctor immediately. Consult a podiatrist immediately for corns, calluses , bunions , blisters , sores, and infections, or ingrown, hard, brittle, split, or discolored toenails. If your senior has problem feet, a weekly trip to a salon for a pedicure makes a great outing. Most salons have special discount days for older adults. Don't forget to ask about these. Keep a checklist -- a ""report card"" -- and update it periodically to keep track of how your parent is doing with meal preparation, housework, mobility (in and out of the house), laundry, shopping, money issues, medications, bathing, dressing, and eating. These are key activities of daily living (ADLs), and difficulty with them indicates there may be trouble. If your parent or parents live in a multilevel home but has problems with stairs, consider a chair lift. They are not inexpensive, but they can be cheaper than moving and will help keep your parent independent for a longer time. For someone who sits a lot, an ergonomic chair that offers greater lumbar support and adjustable features (chair height, armrest height, seat depth) can make a huge difference in overall health. Ergonomic chairs come in all kinds of models and varying prices. If an ergonomic chair is not an option, make sure your father's chair has an adjustable height feature, the seat depth is approximately two-thirds the length of their thighs and buttocks, the back is at least fourteen inches high, and the armrests are no more than nine inches high. Bad posture can complicate back problems and limit mobility. Is Mom walking as upright as they used to? Is Dad favoring one leg over the other for some reason? Sometimes the answer can be as simple as a new pair of shoes. Osteoporosis is a serious problem for older women, leading to height changes and serious (sometimes deadly) fractures . Schedule your parent for a bone density test , and encourage weight-bearing exercise (walking, light weights, gardening). Make sure Mom gets plenty of calcium (the new "" chocolate chew"" supplements are delicious), and ask their doctor about hormone replacement therapy or other treatments. Make sure Mom has a mammogram annually. If there are precautionary measures that must be remembered, make a checklist and post it in a place where it can't possibly be missed. But change the list and its location from time to time so that it doesn't get taken for granted after a while. If you use a dry erase board or a chalkboard, ask your parent to check off the points as they are followed. The older you get, the more you are affected by alcohol. On the other hand, a glass of wine now and then has been known to be beneficial for the heart . Check with your loved one's doctor for a good rule of thumb. In the meantime, locate some ""zero-proof"" recipes and dress them up -- tiny umbrellas and all -- for a special or even not-so-special occasion. Don't minimize changes in your parents' health, even if they seem minor. These changes may be accompanied by fear, which can exacerbate even a minor problem. Address your parents' fears; be positive about your ability to find a solution. Anemia is very common among older adults, usually resulting from either a loss of blood or a poor diet. Check with the doctor as to whether iron supplements (taken with orange juice or with vitamin C for better absorption) might be in order. Help prevent infections by keeping antibacterial wet wipes handy at all times. Keep boxes of them around the house; individually wrapped ones can go in your purse or wallet and in the car. Avoid foot fungus by keeping feet clean and dry. That means changing socks daily and shoes often. It's also a good idea to let feet ""air out"" once a day. Nylon or synthetic socks are more likely to make feet sweat. Cotton is better. If socks are too tight at the tops, they can interfere with circulation. Cut notches into them to make sure they don't bind. Teach your loved one to respect pain. If something hurts, there's a reason for it. Bedsores -- or pressure sores -- result when there is constant pressure on an area where bones are close to the skin 's surface. Be on the lookout for problems in these most vulnerable areas: the back of the head, the shoulder blades, the elbows, the base of the spine, the hips, the heels, and the ankles . Consult a doctor if you see red, cracking, or dried skin. In the meantime, encourage Dad to move about when they can, and don't leave them sitting or lying on a damp surface. Make sure linens are not irritating, and wash them often. Always wear (disposable) rubber gloves when you suspect you might have any kind of skin disorder, such as a rash , an infection, or a lesion of any type. Eating and the Older Adult It's a good idea to accompany your mother to the supermarket occasionally to point out new products and to make sure they are shopping wisely. Encourage them to read labels for salt content, sugar, and other health considerations. If they resist, urge them to at least heed fat content. Generally, none of us should be taking in more than 30% of our daily calorie intake in the form of fat, and of that, no more than 10% should come from saturated fats. Olive oil is a good source of unsaturated fat. Frozen foods, which are processed right after they are harvested, often retain more vitamins than ""fresh"" vegetables, which may sit on shelves for days before getting to the supermarket. When ordering packaged meals from local agencies, ask for extra vegetables. Also, consider supplementing the meal with a homemade side dish. Would a small refrigerator or a mini microwave in the bedroom or family room make it easier for Dad to have nutritious snacks all day long? If shopping is a problem, maybe you can fit an extra freezer in Mom's home somewhere that will allow them to stock up. Does your grandfather need help with cooking? Contact Meals on Wheels of America to find a local program that will deliver free meals to their home. All adults older than sixty are eligible. Note that Meals on Wheels doesn't deliver on weekends, so you'll have to make other arrangements. Can a neighbor help? How about a local church or other religious organization? Or ask a local favorite restaurant to deliver a couple of meals. If your father has vision problems, put liquid in a see-through cup or glass so they can see the liquid. If your mother's on a special diet, write the day's menu on a blackboard and ask them to check each item off as it's consumed. Fax a weekly shopping list to your parent's local market and ask for it to be delivered. You can even pay for it over the phone with your credit card. Find easy recipes that allow your parent to cook with canned and packaged foods -- they combine quickly and are quite tasty. There are a variety of cookbooks in this category. Mom might enjoy Desperation Dinners , by Beverly Mills and Alicia Ross; for Dad, how about A Man, a Can, a Plan , by David Joachim. There are cookbooks available with easy recipes suitable for special diets (diabetes, heart disease), cooking for one, or microwave cooking. Browse the bookstore or search Amazon.com for the one that will suit your parents' tastes. When you call, casually ask your parent to tell you what they have been eating. ""What did you have for dinner last night?"" is better than ""How's your appetite?"" If Mom is passing up making the meals they once loved because ""it's just one person,"" get them a small wok and a cooking-for-one cook-book. Schedule visits at mealtimes so they'll have an excuse to cook. If asked, the grocer might break up packages to sell smaller quantities to your parent, like a half-dozen eggs, two potatoes, or just a few slices of bread (the grocer can use the rest of the loaf to make sandwiches). Ultra-pasteurized milk that comes in cardboard cartons has a very long shelf life. Just make sure your parent chills it before drinking and refrigerates it after it's opened. If your loved one takes a long time to eat, arrange for them to start their meal before everyone else. Be especially patient at mealtimes; older adults often eat much more slowly than what you may be used to. Try to minimize distractions at mealtimes, and don't bring up stressful subjects. ""We usually have dinner with my grandmother on Sunday nights. It's nice, but sometimes she can go on autopilot, where instead of having a conversation, she just has a long monologue, a riff on everything. You can't get a word in edgewise. That can be frustrating, but as my father pointed out, she spends a lot of her week alone, bottling up thoughts and ideas, and so when she gets a chance to unload, she needs to let it all out."" -Ilene Klausner A person who is easily confused might have an easier mealtime if you serve one course at a time and clear each one away before serving the next. A solid-color tablecloth, as opposed to a patterned one, will minimize mealtime distractions. Maybe your parent or grandparent just hates eating in the kitchen. Try moving to the dining room or even a space outdoors. Don't ever wrap dentures in napkins, assuming you will retrieve them after the meal. Chances are they'll be thrown out. Freeze small containers of your leftovers from home to share with your parent. Label them with the date and contents. Freeze sauces, soups, and bouillon in ice cube trays so that individual servings can be popped out and heated. Make sure that your parent or grandparent has access to lots of healthy, easy-to-eat snacks, such as berries, bagels, pitas, cheese, raisins, crackers, energy bars, or apple, melon, or orange slices. If Mom's appetite is lagging, find out if they have a taste or yen for something special. Experiment with old recipes to make them more palatable and ""legal"" (use lactose-free milk, salt and sugar substitutes, ground meat instead of cubed, or yogurt instead of cream, but first consult a doctor about the interaction of these substitutes with any medications). There are tons of books on the subject and most have recipes. Consult them. If your loved one is having trouble gaining or maintaining weight, pack their diet with liquid calories. Fruit juices, milk, and milk alternatives such as soy, rice, and nut milks are high in nutrients and calories and are much less filling than solid foods. Smoothies, yogurt shakes, and protein drinks are a little more filling, but may still make a good meal alternative. Respect your father's tastes. If they have hated yogurt all their life, don't start feeding it to them now just because they are less able to resist. A water filter makes a great gift for an older parent or grandparent. Four or five smaller meals during the day can be more manageable than three large ones. This approach has the added benefit of keeping blood sugar levels more even throughout the day. If your parent has vision problems, use the ""clock"" method of serving food: the main dish is right in front of them at ""six o'clock,"" the starch dish is farthest and directly opposite at ""twelve o'clock,"" and so on. When family and friends call and ask what gift they can bring, suggest prepared foods. (If your parent gets Meals on Wheels deliveries, save the goodies for the weekend.) Use plastic bibs at mealtime. ""Dad flipped when he saw Mom come at him with a bib! He was furious and refused to wear it. 'I'm not a baby,' he screamed. So the next night when we sat down to eat, all of us -- the kids, me, my husband, and his parents -- wore bibs. We all wound up laughing about it, and Dad admitted that it wasn't such a big deal after all. We promised never to make him wear it in restaurants, unless, of course, he ordered the lobster."" -Vonda Giraldo It's OK to bring a special meal to a restaurant for your parent and ask to have it microwaved for you, just as long as everyone else is ordering off the menu. Waiters and waitresses want to help you; tell them what you need privately, to avoid embarrassment. And a good chef, if they are not too busy, can accommodate anyone. Show your appreciation, and tip accordingly. Dry food can be difficult to swallow. Use sauces generously, but learn to make healthy versions. Use flexible straws. For those who refuse regular meals, keep healthy snacks (fruits, nutritious cookies, cut-up vegetables) available around the house. Finger foods are best. Be creative -- but not overbearing -- in your coaxing efforts. Try using children's non-spill cups with covers or sports drink containers with a straw. Make mealtime more special by using fancy plates and napkins. For some, it's easier to cut food with scissors than a knife and fork. If Mom can't cut their meat any longer, avoid embarrassment by cutting it for them in the kitchen before you serve. Soft and pureed foods don't have to be bland and tasteless. Find out which herbs and spices make an otherwise bland dish interesting. You might also serve the following in colorful combinations: cereal puddings and gelatin cooked and creamed vegetables cheese soups and stews egg salad and tuna and other fish salads tabouli, baba ganoush, and hummus cooked fish sushi pasta stewed fruit egg rolls, cut up chicken nuggets scrambled eggs and omelettes pancakes and French toast rice and risotto yogurt meat loaf Baby food is great if you need to get a meal together in a hurry. The fruit selections are delicious! Get a copy of The Non-Chew Cookbook , by Randy J. Wilson. No one likes to eat alone. If Mom insists that you partake of their bland, pureed diet, consider bringing along your own snacks at mealtime. Too many items on the table can be confusing. Keep condiments to a minimum. ""My mother hated dinnertime and often refused to settle down for it. So we started a routine of getting a little dressed up for dinner each night -- she wears a nice brooch and one of her many scarves, and she likes to carry a purse -- and now she looks forward to what's become her favorite part of our day."" -Michaela Kevis Freely make use of microwaveable prepackaged foods. You can stock up on them and put them in the freezer after marking each with the day of the week when it should be eaten. If your loved one can't swallow thin liquids, someone has probably recommended Thick-It, a tasteless powder that thickens hot and cold liquids. The canister is bulky, so keep small supplies of Thick-It in your bag to use on outings. If Dad's not supposed to drink unthickened liquid, don't cheat, not even ""just this once."" Older adults should always eat sitting up. Take your parent to lunch, even if you're at work. Call at lunchtime, and you can eat together -- you at the desk, they at home in the kitchen. But remember that it's dangerous for an older person (or anyone else) to talk while chewing. Your parent's peak period of digestion (when it's easiest to digest food) is midday. Plan the large meal for that time of day, and keep supper light. When feeding your father, only put one teaspoon of food in their mouth at once. Alternate spoonfuls of solids and liquids. Plan your mother's weekly menu ahead of time so shopping for all meals can be done at once. Copy their recipes onto cards and write the shopping list for each dish on the backs. Take the cards with you when you go shopping. Older adults who seem to have endless appetites often forget they have just eaten. Put stickers on the clock for mealtimes so they can see how long it is until the next meal. Making small nutritious snacks available throughout the day is also helpful. Your parent should never lie down right after a meal -- that is the most common cause of indigestion. (Eating too fast is the second most common cause.) Make sure Mom sits or stands for at least an hour after they eat. Many medications leave an awful taste in the mouth that is far worse than anything you can imagine. They can make sugar taste like salt, and some favorite foods become completely inedible. Be especially patient during this time as you try new things to see what works. In the meantime, a lollipop may help your loved one after they have eaten something distasteful. (Don't give sucking candies to anyone who might easily swallow them whole.) You can get someone to come to the house just to feed meals to your parent. Contact your Area Agency on Aging. Even if Mom isn't making use of the local senior center, they can attend every day just for meals. If salt is an issue, there are a bunch of flavorful seasoning substitutes on the market. ""I bribed Mom to eat toward the end -- it was the only way I could get her to take anything. I actually gave her a quarter for every meal. The funny thing is, I forgot all about this. Then, after she passed away and we were going through her bedroom, I found jars of quarters under her bed! It all added up to over $150, which we donated to the local food bank, which is exactly where I knew she'd want it to go. It helped give us closure to know that the money that helped feed our mother would now feed others."" -Brenda Bienvenuti There are tons of special utensils that can make eating a lot easier; a combination fork and knife for one-handed eating, a tilted spoon for someone with hand problems, or a two-handled mug for easier drinking are available from the many suppliers of special-needs items. You can also buy plate guards that keep food from sliding off. B Independent offers a wide range of such products. Jews, Christians, Sikhs, Muslims, and Hindus all incorporate fasting into various rituals and celebrations. If your parent is observant, but you suspect they may not be physically up to the fast, speak to their doctor or spiritual counselor, who can talk to them about reasonable exemptions from fasting. Diet supplements like Ensure are widely used in hospitals and nursing homes. Keep them cooled. Put a few cans on ice in the morning, and make them available all day long. A glass of wine, if it's allowed by your Mom's doctor, can stimulate the appetite. Sleep and Older Adults If Grandma has trouble sleeping (and is not bedridden), encourage them to spend as little ""awake time"" as possible in bed. Reading, watching TV, and so forth, should be done in a favorite chair, while bed is for sleep only. Going to sleep and waking up at about the same time each day will also help train their body for better sleep overall. Older adults should avoid oversleeping in the morning. It leads to having trouble falling asleep later, and the cycle of insomnia begins. If Dad can't fall asleep within fifteen minutes of getting into bed, suggest them to get up for a while and do something calming, and then try again later. Don't take sleep disruption lightly. It can be caused by an improper dose of medication, an illness, or a psychological problem. Talk about it with your loved one's doctor. Many drugs, including Halcion and even the antidepressants that are supposed to make their life better, can cause terrifying nightmares. If your father wakes with night terrors, be reassuring. Show them that there's no danger nearby, but avoid arguing. If they insist that something (or someone) woke them, let them know that whatever the trouble was, it's gone now. People of any age who have difficulty sleeping should avoid exercise in the late afternoon and evening. Try morning walks instead. Avoid caffeine, not just in the evening but at any time of day. Aside from coffee, tea, and cola, look out for caffeine in chocolate, non-cola soft drinks, and some pain relievers. And while decaffeinated coffee has less caffeine than regular, it's not caffeine-free. Alcohol can make your senior drowsy at first, but it hurts healthy sleep in the long run by disturbing the sleep cycle, making sleep less restful, and making them more likely to wake up during the night. As with practically everything, ""A good laugh and a long sleep are the two best cures."" -Irish proverb Maintain a sleep diary to note sleep patterns. The doctor will find this information useful if you need to consult with her, and you might discover patterns you weren't aware of: Is sleeping a problem the night before the family comes to visit? Is this about anxiety or excitement? Visit the National Sleep Foundation for more information. If there are serious issues that require discussion, don't bring these up right before bedtime. Avoid arguments. Some people swear by a teaspoon of honey in a cup of hot water before bedtime. Others go for warm milk with a little cinnamon. But if liquids are a problem before bed, find a different solution. A foot bath or massage right before bed can help. Get dark-lined (blackout) shades for people who don't sleep well, and block out disturbing noise with a fan or a white noise machine. Some models have a choice of sounds that mimic ocean waves, the patter of raindrops, and other soothing sounds. Aromatherapy using lavender candles and potpourri can be very relaxing. Try a couple drops of lavender oil in a bath or on the corner of your parent's pillow. You can even buy soft microwavable products that warm up potpourri inside. Change the linens often. Everyone enjoys fresh sheets. You can even buy lavender water to put in the wash. It's sold in a lot of home stores and catalogs these days. Unpleasant odors can interfere with sleep. Use potpourri and make sure the air in the room has a chance to circulate. When Mom's out of the room for a while, open the windows or light a scented candle. Create a sleep ritual before bedtime and follow this every evening. If you live far away, you can still call at bedtime to wish your parents sweet dreams. Cotton pajamas and sheets are less irritating than synthetics. Restless leg syndrome is a condition in which one leg or both legs experience nervous sensations that cause excessive movement. It's a fairly common condition that can often be treated with medication, iron supplements, and exercise. Is this what's keeping your loved one awake? Find out more online and talk to your doctor. Does Dad's snoring rock the house? Is Grandma really sleepy in the morning and drowsy during the day? They may have sleep apnea, a disorder in which the person stops breathing at points during sleep. Consistent loud snoring, observed episodes of not breathing, and morning and daytime sleepiness are some of the warning signs. Men, people who are over forty, and people who are overweight are all at higher risk, but anyone can have it, and it's more common than diabetes. Sleep apnea can lead to insomnia, high blood pressure, weight gain, headaches, memory problems, excessive drowsiness, depression, impotence -- the list goes on. Make sure the mattress your father sleeps on is comfortable and right for them. Soft beds are nice, but maybe they need more support. It's easier to rise from a firm mattress. Some people are just not morning people. If getting your parent up every morning is a problem and you already have enough to do at that hour, let them stay in bed until midmorning, if they like, and get them up after the family has gone off to work and school. While it may be tempting to take naps, they should be avoided if they interfere with getting a good night's sleep. Arrange calming activities before bedtime; this is a time for reading, soft music, and soothing conversation. Have your loved one spend some time in pajamas before settling in to sleep. Saying prayers together before bedtime can be a wonderful ritual. Maybe Mom can't sleep because they have issues they can't talk about. Try to discuss this with them, or suggest they discuss the problem with another member of the family or a professional. Remind your senior to go to the bathroom before going to sleep. If they get up often at night to go to the bathroom, suggest that they don't drink any liquids for three or four hours before bedtime. On the other hand, don't skimp too much on fluids during the day because you want to cut down on bathroom visits. Older adults often become dehydrated, which leads to painful (but common) urinary tract infections. Learn sleep techniques and teach them to your senior: Listen to your own breath and count breaths. Get comfortable, close your eyes, and begin breathing slowly but normally, then count each exhalation, either starting at one or counting back from one hundred. Practice progressive muscle relaxation by tensing and relaxing one limb at a time. Make a fist and clench your right arm, while keeping the left relaxed; then relax the right arm. Repeat with the left arm, then each leg. Use visualization techniques to picture yourself in a perfect, relaxing place, such as a quiet beach or lakeside. Try a tape or CD that will guide you through a relaxation exercise or visualization. There are many available. You can even make your own. Make up for lost sleep as soon as possible. A baby monitor will alert you to any nighttime problems your parent may be having, and they will feel secure knowing that if they call in the middle of the night, you will hear them. Show them how the monitor works. If it's the bed that's keeping your father awake, consider getting a hospital bed. Medicare will pay for it if their doctor recommends it. A foam ""egg crate"" mattress will help prevent bedsores and can be purchased from any medical supply house. Rotate a new mattress once a month the first year and every season (four times a year) after that. A mattress should be replaced every eight to ten years. If they sleep in the same bed but Mom needs a firm mattress and Dad prefers something softer, consider getting two single beds and moving them next to each other. You can use king- or queen-sized bedding, so it looks like one bed. This allows many couples to feel comfortable without giving up intimacy. A clock with brightly illuminated numbers can keep someone awake. Use the dimmer on the clock if it has one, turn the clock to the wall, or get a new clock. Some people have trouble sleeping because their biological clocks are waking them at weird times. To ""reset"" Dad's biological clock, have them get up in the morning at the time they are like to awaken each day and spend about ten minutes facing the sun. If your mother grinds their teeth at night -- a common condition called bruxism -- talk to the dentist. Mom might need a mouth guard. Keep familiar, favorite photos at the bedside to calm Mom in case they wake up confused about where they are. If they travel or have to spend some time in the hospital, keep these same items at their bedside there for continuity. Exercise and Older Adults Nowhere is the saying, ""use it or lose it,"" more meaningful than among older adults. Aside from its cardiovascular benefits, exercise combats depression and osteoporosis, reduces the risk of falling, cuts down on healing time when there are injuries and illnesses, and generally improves lifestyle. Encourage your grandmother to stick to a routine. Ask your older relative to keep an exercise log and consult it often. Compliment their progress and celebrate breakthroughs. Yoga is a great form of gentle exercise that improves the immune system and promotes well-being, among many other benefits. Weight training, tai chi, swimming, and low-impact aerobics are also generally beneficial to seniors. Make your own exercise video for your mother. They might hate the idea of staring at a nubile twenty-something while they do their stretching exercises, but what if, instead, they had an image of you or their granddaughter guiding them through the routine? If you own a video camera, don't pass up this opportunity to make each day more special for them. Set up an area of your Dad's home where they can exercise safely. Make it special: get an attractive exercise mat and maybe even hang up an inspirational poster. Get them colorful workout wear or a funny T-shirt (""Over the hill? What hill?""). If you can't go yourself, hire a reliable teen to take your parent for a walk. The outing might be less awkward if you give it a purpose, like a daily trip to the store for bagels and a newspaper. Gardening, housecleaning, and shopping can be considered exercise. Redefine the word exercise as needed. Things change. From time to time, review your loved one's exercise routine to make sure it's still appropriate. Encourage deep breathing. Most people forget to breathe when they exercise. Check with a doctor or physical therapist before your loved one embarks on any exercise routine. ""I've heard that advice about a million times and was assured by our family doctor that Dad's calisthenics were just fine for him. But it never occurred to me to check back after he developed a minor ear infection that left him with a slight balancing problem. It turned out that even some of the neck rolls he was doing were affecting his ability to stand up without getting dizzy."" -Bari Meyer If your grandfather isn't motivated to exercise, take them to a ball game to remind them of what it was like to have the wind blow through their hair (when they had hair). Walking to your seats is enough to get the body moving, and the fresh air will do wonders for them. Bring your older parent to a physical therapist for advice and general guidance. If you can get Dad's doctor to recommend the visit, insurance will pay for it. If not, it'll be a worthy expense, given the possible benefits. All exercise routines, even walking, should start and end with a period of stretching. A stretch needs to be held for at least five seconds to be effective. If your father refuses to exercise, try to get them to at least work on one of the important muscle groups: arms, legs, shoulders, or back. Exercising to music is always more fun, especially if the music is your favorite. Make your loved one a special exercise tape of their favorite tunes. If your parent totally resists the idea of exercise, don't try to bully them into it. The mall opens before the stores do, and in many areas, people have discovered that they're a great place to walk. Aisles are nice and wide, and it's temperature-controlled.It's also a great way to meet people. Make sure security has arrived on duty by the time your parent or grandparent gets there. Exercise reduces stress. That's probably something you both need. Do it together. Consider a professional personal trainer. Even if it's too expensive to have one regularly, a couple sessions will get Mom started on the right track and allow them to develop an appropriate routine. It's a good idea for someone else to be around when your parent exercises, just in case there are problems. If you or a family member can't be there, this is a potential job for a responsible teen. An hour of brisk walking four times a week can drastically improve the quality of life for an older person -- or anyone else, for that matter. Buy Mom a pedometer so they can measure their distance when they walk. Start a senior exercise class in your dad's neighborhood. A small group can pool their resources and hire a teacher just for them, at their convenience. If no one has a basement big enough, ask restaurant owners whether their private rooms, which are rarely used during the daytime, can be made available. Or, perhaps the local school can let them use part of the gym when it's not being used. Walking is still the best exercise there is. Learn to enjoy walking slowly with your loved one. ""When I first started taking Gramps out for short walks, I thought I'd go crazy -- each block took a good half hour, which was often the length of a whole visit. I soon learned to appreciate the value of slowing down my day this way, and seeing the world this way brought us closer together."" -Steve Fein Yoga classes can be beneficial to both you and your loved one. Consider taking classes together. If your parent hates the idea of walking, ask them to help you by running certain errands for you (""Dad, could you return this to the library for me?""). Swimming is often an option for older adults who have lost mobility. Also, water exercise classes are available at many swimming facilities. Dancing: it's good exercise, it's a great social activity, the music can be therapeutic, and it's a wonderful way to meet people. Find out what classes are available locally, and don't ignore those classes that are aimed at kids. Instructors at those classes might be willing to start offering adult classes if enough students can be gathered. Look into special exercise programs for older adults in the neighborhood. Visit the classes on your own before you suggest your parent joins. There are some good ones out there, but some can be depressing to those who are fairly vital. Squeezing balls of clay is good exercise for arthritic hands, as are therapeutic squeeze balls made just for that purpose. They're available at most drugstores. Older adults have found that weight lifting using relatively light weights strengthens the body, helps bone density, increases flexibility, and reassures them of their abilities. Always check with a doctor before your loved one embarks on any exercise program."
42,What Is Homeopathy?,"Homeopathy is a medical system based on the belief that the body can cure itself. Those who practice it use tiny amounts of natural substances, like plants and minerals. They believe these stimulate the healing process. It was developed in the late 1700s in Germany. It’s common in many European countries, but it’s not quite as popular in the United States. How Does It Work? A basic belief behind homeopathy is “like cures like.” In other words, something that brings on symptoms in a healthy person can -- in a very small dose -- treat an illness with similar symptoms. This is meant to trigger the body’s natural defenses. For example, red onion makes your eyes water. That’s why it’s used in homeopathic remedies for allergies . Treatments for other ailments are made from poison ivy , white arsenic, crushed whole bees, and an herb called arnica . Homeopathic doctors (who also are called “homeopaths”) weaken these ingredients by adding water or alcohol. Then they shake the mixture as part of a process called “potentization.” They believe this step transfers the healing essence. Homeopaths also believe that the lower the dose, the more powerful the medicine. In fact, many of these remedies no longer contain any molecules of the original substance. They come in a variety of forms, like sugar pellets, liquid drops, creams, gels, and tablets. During your appointment, a homeopath will ask a number of questions about your mental, emotional, and physical health. They’ll prescribe the remedy that best matches all of your symptoms. Then they’ll tailor the treatment for you. You can also buy over-the-counter homeopathic remedies at drugstores and health food stores. The dosage and quality of these products depend on the manufacturer. What Conditions Does Homeopathy Treat? It’s used for a wide variety of health issues, including some chronic illnesses: Allergies Migraines Depression Chronic fatigue syndrome Rheumatoid arthritis Irritable bowel syndrome Premenstrual syndrome It can also be used for minor issues like bruises , scrapes, toothaches , headaches , nausea , coughs , and colds . Don’t use homeopathic medicine for life-threatening illnesses, like asthma , cancer , and heart disease , or in emergencies. You should also avoid using it in place of vaccines . Some homeopathic products called “nosodes” are marketed as an alternative for vaccines , but there’s no research to prove they’re effective. Does It Work? Research is mixed. Some studies show that homeopathic remedies are helpful, while others don’t. Critics chalk up the benefits to the placebo effect . That’s when symptoms improve because you believe the treatment is working -- not because it really is. This can trigger the brain to release chemicals that briefly relieve the pain or other symptoms. Doctors are divided because some of the theories behind homeopathy don’t line up with the principles of chemistry and physics. Scientists argue that a medicine with no active ingredient shouldn’t have an effect on the body. What Are the Risks? The FDA oversees homeopathic remedies. But it doesn’t check to see if they’re safe or effective. In general, most are so watered down that they don’t cause any side effects. But there are exceptions. Homeopathic medicines can contain a large amount of an active ingredient, like a heavy metal, that can be dangerous. Case in point: In 2016, the FDA issued a warning against using homeopathic teething tablets and gels because of possible health risks to infants and children. If you’re thinking about trying these alternative treatments, talk to your doctor. They can make sure they’re safe and won’t interact with any other medications you’re taking."
43,What Is Homocystinuria?,"Homocystinuria (HCY) is a rare condition that interferes with your body’s ability to break down a protein from the food you eat. Protein is made of smaller building blocks called amino acids. Normally, your body processes these acids into energy for everything you do. When you have HCY, your body can’t break down (metabolize) an amino acid called methionine. If left untreated, this acid and another called homocysteine build up in your bloodstream and can cause serious problems. What Causes It? A specific enzyme in your body breaks down methionine. If you have HCY, either you don’t make this enzyme or it’s not working right. A pair of genes tells your body how to make this enzyme correctly. If both don’t work, you’ll get homocystinuria. This is an inherited illness. The gene must be passed down from both of your parents. What Are the Symptoms? Babies born with homocystinuria look perfectly fine. Signs and symptoms start to show up within the first few years of life. HCY affects all kids differently. If your child has it, they may have many or none of these symptoms: Pale hair and skin Abnormally-shaped chest Slow weight gain and growth Severe nearsightedness and lens dislocation (which can lead to blindness) Tall, slender build Long, skinny fingers Weak bones Blood clots (increasing the risk for stroke and heart disease ) Seizures Other symptoms may include: Developmental delays (slow to crawl, walk, and talk) Learning disabilities and intellectual issues Behavior and emotional problems How’s It Diagnosed? Babies in the United States and many other countries are screened for homocystinuria (and other conditions) shortly after birth. It’s part of a blood test known as the newborn screen. The screening includes a blood test that may show whether your child is at risk of having HCY. If results aren’t normal, they’ll need follow-up blood and urine tests to get a firm diagnosis. How’s It Treated? A metabolic doctor trained in genetic diseases will recommend a treatment plan. You need to start it right away to prevent problems. There are two types of HCY. The milder version can be treated with prescription-strength vitamin B6 supplements . Your baby ’s doctor may perform tests to see if they will be likely to help. The vitamin helps prevent behavior problems and intellectual problems in some kids. It may lessen the risk of eye and bone problems and blood clots. If vitamin B6 doesn’t work, your child will start a low-methionine diet . It usually needs to be continued for life. A dietitian with expertise in amino acid disorders can help make an eating plan from infancy and beyond. Your child probably will have to avoid high protein foods, including: Cow’s milk Cheese Meat and fish Eggs Some other foods will likely need to be limited or avoided. These include: Nuts and peanut butter Dried beans Regular flour Fruits and veggies have small amounts of methionine and can be eaten in carefully controlled amounts. There are foods made especially for people with HCY too. These include flour, pasta, and bread that are low in methionine. Your child probably will need a special formula to replace milk. It has protein (minus the methionine) and other nutrients needed for normal growth. Your doctor may decide to add a supplement too: Betaine and folic acid . These supplements can lower dangerously high homocysteine levels. Children who don’t get better with vitamin B6 often respond well to betaine. Vitamin B12 and L-cysteine. HCY may be causing low levels of these needed substances. B12 is given as a shot. L-cysteine is another amino acid that can be taken as a supplement if it’s not a part of the special formula. Your child’s blood and urine will be tested regularly to make sure treatment is working. Sometimes it needs to be tweaked as your child grows and changes. What Can I Expect? If your child begins treatment as a baby and stays on it, they’ll probably grow and develop normally. Treatment also can lower the risk of strokes, heart disease , and blood clots. Vision problems may still happen even with treatment. These can be fixed with surgery or other methods."
44,Alpha-1 Antitrypsin (AAT) Deficiency,"What Is AAT Deficiency? Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency is a condition that can cause serious lung or liver disease. Symptoms often include trouble breathing and jaundiced, or yellow, skin. It's a genetic disease, which means it's passed down to you from your parents. You get it because your liver doesn't make enough of the AAT protein, and much of what it does make gets trapped in your liver. You need this protein to protect your lungs from inflammation and damage caused by infections and irritants such as smoke and pollution. If your lungs are damaged, you can get COPD or emphysema. AAT deficiency is sometimes known as genetic COPD or genetic emphysema. And when AAT builds up in your liver, the buildup may cause scarring, or cirrhosis, of your liver. You might not know you have the disease until you're an adult. Most people get their first symptoms between the ages of 20 and 50. Symptoms of AAT Deficiency When you have AAT deficiency, your lungs don't get enough of a protein they need to protect them. This can lead to COPD or emphysema. (Photo credit: Lisa F. Young/Dreamstime) Common symptoms of AAT deficiency include: Wheezing or whistling sounds when you breathe Having colds often Feeling tired A fast heartbeat when you stand up Weight loss If AAT deficiency affects your liver, you could have: Yellowish skin or eyes A swollen belly or legs Coughing up of blood A newborn baby might have: Yellowing of the skin or eyes (jaundice) Bright yellow urine Trouble gaining weight An enlarged liver Bleeding from the nose or umbilical stump Pale, smelly poop Low energy It's rare, but some people also get a skin disease called panniculitis. It is inflammation of the fat layer under your skin and causes hardening of the skin along with painful lumps or patches. How Alpha-1 Affects Your Liver Alpha-1 is a rare disease that makes an enzyme in your liver work poorly. Alpha-1 antitrypsin protein usually travels from your liver through your blood to protect your lungs and other organs. But if the proteins aren't the right shape, they can get stuck in your liver. This can cause cirrhosis , severe liver damage and scarring, and liver cancer . And because the proteins aren't traveling to your lungs like they should, it can also cause lung problems. AAT Testing First, your doctor will listen to your breathing with a stethoscope to check for wheezing or other signs that your lungs aren't working right. Blood tests. These will show the levels of AAT in your blood and measure your liver function. A special blood test called a blood gases test looks at the oxygen level in your arteries, a sign of how well your lungs work. Genetic testing: If your blood levels of AAT are low, these tests will find abnormal genes and see if any have a link to AAT. Imaging. X-rays and CT scans show where damage is in your lungs and how serious it is. Pulmonary function tests. You'll breathe into a machine that measures how well your lungs are working. Liver ultrasound or elastography. These tests will show if there are signs of scarring on your liver. Liver biopsy. A small sample of cells is taken using a very thin needle and checked for signs of damage. Questions for the Doctor It's important to ask your doctor any question you have about this condition. You might start with these: Have you treated other people with AAT deficiency? What treatments do you suggest? Is replacement therapy something that may be right for me? What are my chances of having COPD or emphysema? How will we know how I'm doing? Should my children be tested for this condition? Is it safe for me to exercise? What are some things I can do to manage my symptoms? Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency Treatment There's no cure for AAT deficiency. But you can protect yourself from more lung damage with a treatment called augmentation therapy, sometimes called replacement therapy. It works by raising the amount of AAT protein in your blood. You may also have this treatment if you get emphysema. With this treatment, you get a new supply of AAT protein from healthy human donors through an IV once a week. You can have this procedure at your doctor's office or at home with the help of a technician. Augmentation therapy can slow or stop the damage to your lungs, but it won't reverse the disease or heal any damage you already have. You'll need these treatments for the rest of your life. You may also get a bronchodilator, or medication to open your airways that you breathe into your lungs with an inhaler. If your breathing trouble leads to low levels of oxygen in your blood, you might need extra oxygen through a mask or nosepiece. Your doctor may also suggest that you go into pulmonary rehab, where you can learn breathing techniques and exercises, as well as how to make some everyday activities easier. Why Get Tested for Alpha-1? Though there's no cure for AAT deficiency, there are treatments to delay or prevent lung disease. It's also important to know if you can pass the genes on to family members. A healthy lifestyle--including a balanced diet, regular exercise, and not smoking--can help keep your lungs in the best possible shape. If you do develop lung disease, you can work with your doctor on a plan to help you manage symptoms and feel your best. Your Care Team for AAT Deficiency Your health care team is an important part of diagnosing and treating AAT deficiency. Here are some of the medical professionals you could visit for care: Pediatrician. You're more likely to get AAT deficiency as an adult, but kids get it, too. A pediatrician takes care of the general health of children and young adults, or they may specialize in certain health conditions. Geneticist. Since AAT deficiency is a genetic disease, your doctor may suggest genetic testing to precisely diagnose or help manage it. Geneticists and genetic counselors work with you and your regular doctor to include genetic information in your health care plan. Pulmonologist. These doctors diagnose and treat illnesses that affect your lungs, such as AAT deficiency. Gastroenterologist. AAT deficiency can also affect your liver, one of the organs that gastroenterologists focus on. These doctors mainly diagnose and treat diseases affecting your digestive tract. Pulmonary rehab team. Experts suggest pulmonary rehabilitation for people with AAT deficiency. This is a program of exercise, breathing techniques, education, nutrition, and more. It's designed to help people with pulmonary disease. Doctors, nurses, physical and respiratory therapists, exercise specialists, and dietitians could all be part of your rehab team. What to Expect With AAT Deficiency AAT deficiency is different for everyone. Some people have severe problems. Others may have few or no symptoms. Breathing issues. You'll be more sensitive to smoke, dust, and allergens like pollen. If you catch a cold, your symptoms may be stronger. You also might have chronic bronchitis, an irritation of your airways that causes coughing and affects breathing. COPD. AAT deficiency can cause chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). When you have COPD, you often have symptoms of emphysema, a serious condition that makes it hard for you to push air out of your lungs. COPD can make you wheeze and struggle to breathe. You may cough up mucus and feel tightness in your chest. Liver issues. About 30% to 40% of people with this condition will have liver problems at some point in their lives. While these health issues are possibilities, with treatment, you'll probably still be able to work, be active, and enjoy many of your favorite hobbies. In babies and children, the condition is more likely to cause liver damage than lung problems. Still, only about 10% of children with it have severe liver disease. Children with AAT deficiency also may have asthma. Treating Liver Problems If your liver is damaged, you can get treatment to help prevent or slow down the health problems this can cause. You can also get treatments to ease symptoms. These include: Vitamin supplements Medicines to ease itching or jaundice Treatments for bleeding and fluid in your belly If your liver damage is life-threatening or severe, you may need a liver transplant. How Your AAT Deficiency Might Change Over Time You could have the gene that causes AAT deficiency and never have symptoms or organ damage. This is especially true if you avoid smoking. Meanwhile, others with the illness have serious, even deadly health problems. Other conditions that can happen with AAT deficiency include: Lung conditions that get worse over time, like COPD Lasting airway damage (emphysema, bronchiectasis) High blood pressure that affects the arteries from your heart to your lungs (pulmonary hypertension) Liver scarring Liver cancer Heart, liver, or respiratory failure Inflammation of fat beneath the skin (panniculitis) Many people with AAT deficiency live a normal lifespan, especially if they don't smoke. Others may have serious complications. Your medical outlook depends on: Whether you're diagnosed promptly The type of Alpha-1 you have How the disease impacts you Your level of organ damage How strong your lungs are If your lung or liver disease is getting worse quickly or more slowly If you smoke The best thing you can do is follow guidance from your doctor to manage your condition. Tips for Living With AAT Deficiency Good habits are important to help you stay healthy with this condition. There are several things you can do to manage your symptoms: Stay away from things that can irritate your lungs, like smoke, dust, and pet hair. Steer clear of infections: Wash your hands often, and stay away from others who are sick. Pay attention to how you feel, and pace yourself if you need to. Take your medications as prescribed. Stay up to date on vaccines, including those for flu and COVID-19. Talk to your doctor about how to exercise safely. Limit how much alcohol you drink. If you don't drink, don't start. Don't smoke. If you need help to quit, talk to your doctor. Eat a healthful diet. Make daily tasks easier: Plan chores so you can cut down on climbing stairs, or use a rolling cart to move things from place to place. Get the support you need: Ask friends and family for help with tasks. Consider joining a support group to talk with others in a similar situation. If you have feelings of depression, talk to your doctor or a counselor about what treatments may help. Caring for Your Emotional and Mental Health Living with AAT deficiency can affect your emotional health. You're more likely to have feelings of anxiety and depression than someone who doesn't have it. It's important to be aware of how you feel and take steps to help yourself feel better. Let your doctor know how you feel. If your low mood persists, your care provider may suggest that you work with a counselor or therapist. They may also prescribe medications that can help. Take care of your health. Your physical health can affect your mood, so keep up with healthy habits: Get enough sleep, eat a healthy diet, and stay as active as you can with your doctor's OK. Watch your stress levels. Stress can affect how you breathe, so learn techniques that help you manage it. This can be things like breathing exercises, journaling, meditation, or just taking some ""you time."" Connect with support groups. It can help to talk to people who understand what you're going through. You can find names of doctors, links to support groups, genetic counseling resources, and other information from the Alpha-1 Foundation website. Ask for help when you need it. Whether it's taking over some chores for a while or giving a listening ear, support from your loved ones can make a big difference. Let loved ones know how they can help you when you're not feeling your best. The Future of Treatment While augmentation therapy works to slow or stop lung damage from AAT deficiency, it's only for people who are seriously ill. This means people with less severe symptoms often don't get treatment. Augmentation therapy is also expensive, and weekly treatments can be inconvenient. Also, it only treats lung disease, not liver disease that sometimes forms when you have AAT deficiency. Researchers are now looking into new options for people living with this lifelong disease. Here's a closer look at some of them: Recombinant AAT (rAAT) AAT can come from two sources: human plasma and through the use of recombinant technology. Scientists use this technology to create new proteins or change existing ones. In the future, it could be a more consistent and reliable source of AAT. But it's a newer technology and not approved to treat AAT deficiency. Inhaled AAT People with AAT deficiency have replacement therapy through an IV, which can be inconvenient and uncomfortable. Researchers are now studying an inhaler that delivers AAT directly to your lungs. They've found it may work even better than an IV, since most AAT-related damage happens in the lungs. Several studies have found AAT inhalers are safe and boost AAT levels in the lungs. Other emerging treatments Other treatments for AAT deficiency are in different stages of development. They include: Gene therapy. This involves replacing the faulty gene responsible for AAT deficiency with a healthy one. Research into gene therapy for AAT deficiency has been mixed. The results of one study showed the treatment is safe and worked to keep AAT levels in the normal range. But the results of another study showed lower AAT levels. Stem cell therapy. This treatment replaces damaged cells with healthy stem cells. The stem cells come from people with AAT, which scientists use to study and create treatments for the disease. Small molecule therapy. These are drugs that target specific molecules involved in disease. In AAT deficiency, they could help slow liver damage by stopping the protein from building up in liver cells. This type of therapy shows promise but needs more research."
45,Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia,"What Is Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia? Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia is a disorder where it is hard for your body to remove LDL ""bad"" cholesterol from your blood . The disease raises your chances of a heart attack at an early age, but drugs and other treatments can lower your risk. Cholesterol is waxy stuff that's in your cells. LDL 's job is to carry cholesterol around your body in your bloodstream. When you have high levels of LDL , cholesterol builds up in your arteries , the blood vessels that supply oxygen to your heart . The cholesterol can eventually block them and shut off the flow of blood and oxygen to your heart , causing a heart attack . Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia is a disease you're born with. You can start developing high cholesterol when you're a child. It's a serious condition. Without treatment, men with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia can get heart disease in their 40s, and women can get it in their 50s. There's no cure, so you'll need to take drugs and follow a heart-healthy diet throughout your life. If that's not enough, there are special treatments including one that takes blood from your body, removes the cholesterol, and then returns the blood back to you. For some people, this treatment still won't keep cholesterol under control. If that's the case for you, you may need to have a liver transplant . It's major surgery with a lot of recovery time, so it's important to reach out to family and friends to get the emotional support you need. Causes When you have homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, you inherit two copies of a gene that isn't working right, one from each of your parents. Normally, the liver removes extra LDL cholesterol from the blood using particles called LDL receptors. These receptors attach to LDL cholesterol and play a key role in keeping your cholesterol levels under control. When you have this disease, the faulty gene keeps the LDL receptors from working right. Your cholesterol levels get high. You may hear the term heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. This is a related disease. With it, you inherit the broken gene from only one of your parents. It's not as severe as the homozygous form. Symptoms The main sign that you have this condition is very high levels of total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol. For instance, you may have a total cholesterol level of 600 points or higher. By comparison, the American Heart Association recommends the ideal total cholesterol number be less than 200. You may have yellow, waxy patches on your skin over the elbows, knees , and buttocks. These are called xanthomas. Yellowish fat deposits called xanthelasmas can develop in your eyelids. Also, you can get gray or white circles around your cornea , the clear front part of the eye . Some symptoms of heart disease you may have include: Chest pain ( angina ) Rapid heartbeat Shortness of breath Getting a Diagnosis Your doctor will do a physical exam and also take some blood tests. To help make a diagnosis, they may ask you: Have you noticed any yellowish patches on your skin? Do you have any chest pain? Have you ever noticed that you're short of breath? Does your heartbeat ever seem rapid? Do your parents have high cholesterol? Your doctor will check your cholesterol levels by taking a blood sample and sending it to a lab to be analyzed. You may have a blood test to look for the abnormal gene that causes this condition. Your doctor might also want to test some of your close relatives to see if they have the disease. Questions for Your Doctor Do I need to change my diet? Are there drugs that can help lower my cholesterol? How do you check if my treatment is working? If diet and drugs don't lower my cholesterol, are there other treatments that can help? Will my children inherit my condition? Treatment The goal is to lower your LDL cholesterol levels, and your risk for heart disease . You will likely be referred to a doctor that specializes in treating people with cholesterol or lipid disorders. Your doctor will probably recommend that you stick to a diet that's low in saturated fat , cholesterol, and sugar. They may need to try different combinations of drugs and treatments until they find one that works best for you. Since homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia raises your cholesterol to extremely high levels, your doctor may start you on high doses of statin drugs. Statins work by stopping your liver from making cholesterol. Your doctor may also try combining statins with other drugs that lower the amount of cholesterol that gets into your body from the food you eat. Options include ezetimibe ( Zetia ), a PCSK9 inhibitor like a lirocumab ( Praluent ) and evolocumab ( Repatha ), or lomitapide ( Juxtapid ). If different combinations of medicine aren't doing the job, your doctor may also add injections of inclisiran (Leqvio) which has been approved as an add-on therapy to further lower (LDL-C). They may also ask you to try a treatment called apheresis. It removes cholesterol from your blood. It's a little bit like dialysis , the treatment that's used for kidney disease . You go to a clinic or hospital where some of your blood is removed through a tube called a catheter. LDL cholesterol is taken out of your blood before it's returned to your body. The procedure takes several hours, and you'll need to do it regularly. Sometimes, none of the treatments work. In that case, you might need a liver transplant. The new liver will have normal LDL receptors that will remove the bad cholesterol from your blood. Your doctor will put you on a waiting list for a liver from a donor. A liver transplant is major surgery, and it could take you 6 months to a year before you can return to your regular lifestyle. After your transplant, you'll need to take drugs that prevent your body from rejecting the new liver. If you're considering a liver transplant, you'll probably need to get some emotional support from family and friends. Ask your doctor about educational workshops that can help explain what to expect before and after a transplant. Taking Care of Yourself Practice smart lifestyle habits to lower your risk of heart disease . If you smoke, stop. You should limit alcohol consumption, try to reduce stress, treat/manage high blood pressure and diabetes and aim for a healthy weight. Eat a diet that's mostly fruits and vegetables , whole grains, nuts, legumes, seafood, lean poultry, and low-fat dairy. Also, keep the fat in your diet to 30% or less of your daily calories . For example, if you eat 2,000 calories a day, you should eat no more than 65 grams of fat a day. Check food labels to see how much fat is in the food you eat. Try to avoid or limit sources of saturated fat and cholesterol, such as: Red meat Butter Whole milk Coconut and palm oils Egg yolks Try to exercise every day, which also will help control your cholesterol levels. What to Expect After you've been diagnosed, you'll work closely with a cholesterol specialist called a lipidologist. While your doctor is trying to find the treatment that works best, you'll probably need to make regular visits to get blood tests to check your cholesterol levels. It's important to be patient and take the time to get the right treatment plan for you. Sometimes your doctor might need to try several different things before your high cholesterol gets under control. You'll need to manage your condition throughout your life. Make sure you keep up with the drugs your doctor prescribes, and keep eating a healthy diet. Sometimes treatments don't work and your heart disease risk remains high. Ask your doctor about joining a clinical trial . These trials test new drugs to see if they're safe and if they work. They often are a way for people to try new medicine that isn't available to everyone. Make sure you have a support network in place that can give you an emotional lift when you need it. You can also join a support group to get ideas and help from other people who know what you're going through. Getting Support To learn more about homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, visit the web site of the FH Foundation . It's got information about how to join a clinical trial and where to find specialists."
46,What Is a Stye?,"It's a pimple or abscess that forms on your upper or lower eyelid. Sometimes the bacteria that normally live on the surface of your eyelid block an oil duct. Then it gets inflamed. Other times, germs and dead skin cells get trapped on the edge of your eyelid. Most of the time a stye starts as a pimple next to an eyelash. It turns into a red, painful bump that can last several days before it bursts and then heals. Some styes are short-lived and heal on their own. Others may require a doctor’s care. Styes are usually on the surface of your eyelid and easy to see. But they can form deep inside your eyelid. An internal stye (on the underside of your lid) also causes a red, painful bump. But its location prevents a whitehead from showing up on your eyelid. This type can also go away once the infection is gone. Some leave a small fluid-filled cyst that your doctor will have to cut open and drain. What Causes Styes? Usually it’s a combination of a clogged oil gland and a certain type of bacteria. Your body is coated with billions of friendly bacteria that live right along with you. Most of the time there’s no problem. But when conditions are right, the bacteria overproduce and create a pimple. What’s a Chalazion? If the clogged gland that produces the stye never gets better, scar tissue forms around it. The pain goes away but a bump remains. Doctors call that a chronic chalazion (pronounced cha-LAY-zee-yon). Styes and chalazia (that’s the plural of chalazion) are usually harmless. They rarely affect your eyeball or eyesight . Rarely they can cause severe infections of the face called cellulitis . See your eye doctor for any significant pain or drastic swelling/redness of the whole eyelid. They can happen at any age and tend to come back from time to time, especially in people who have ongoing eyelid irritation (blepharitis) or a skin condition called rosacea."
47,Which Medicines Treat Endometriosis Pain?,"Endometriosis is a lifelong condition so it is important to develop a plan to manage it based on the extent of the disease, severity of pain and potential plans for pregnancy. Since it is a chronic disease, it cannot be cured, but there are options for different types of medications to ease endometriosis pain and  help you feel better. Some need a prescription. Others you can buy “over the counter.” Your doctor may recommend that you try more than one kind. Pain Medication If your symptoms are mild, your doctor will likely suggest you take a pain reliever. These may include NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) such as ibuprofen or naproxen . Sometimes endometriosis pain can be severe. So, if you try pain meds that you can buy without a prescription and you don’t get enough relief, your doctor will consider whether you need a prescription for a stronger type of medicine. Hormone Birth Control Taking hormone birth control can stop the heavy menstrual bleeding that generally accompanies endometriosis. Your doctor may advise you to take hormonal birth control on a continuous basis for three or more months to prevent you from having your period. The most common hormones that doctors prescribe for endometriosis include: Birth control pills, patches, and vaginal rings. These contraceptives include both estrogen and progestin. Progestin-only contraceptives. These include pills, shots, and an IUD (intrauterine device). These medicines can cut down on pain, as most women don’t have a period while taking these medicines, or at least have fewer periods. Hormone therapy can cause side effects such as weight gain, depression, acne, body hair, and irregular bleeding. You should talk with your doctor about the risks and benefits. Also, if you stop taking this type of medicine, your symptoms may come back. Tell your doctor if that happens. Gonadotroin-releasing Hormone (GnRH) Analogues If your pain is not controlled with NSAIDS and hormone birth control, your doctor may suggest a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue. This medication causes your ovaries to stop producing estrogen, which in turn causes the endometriosis tissue to shrink. Over 80% of women using this treatment had their pain reduced, including those with severe pain. GnRH analogues also cause you to experience temporary menopause so they are not used if you are trying to become pregnant. There are 2 types of GnRH analogues: GnRH agonists and antagonists. Examples of GnRH agonist analogues include: Goserelin ( Zoladex ) -- Shot taken once every 28 days Leuprolide ( Lupron ) -- Shot taken once every one or three months Nafarelin ( Synarel ) -- Nasal spray taken twice per day Examples of GnRH antagonist analogues include: Elagolix ( Orilissa ) -- It is taken by mouth one to two times a day, depending on your symptoms Doctors limit the number of months these meds are taken because of bone density loss which can increase the risk of fractures. Androgen Receptor Agonist The medication danazol ( Danocrine ) helps stop your body from releasing hormones that it uses to help bring about your period and increases your immune system. You need to be on birth control while you take it to prevent pregnancy. If you get pregnant while taking danazol, it could cause a female baby to have male traits. Aromatase Inhibitors Aromatase is a chemical that boosts your body’s estrogen production. Aromatase inhibitors block it, which lowers your estrogen level.  These medicines aren’t routinely used to treat endometriosis. But in some cases, doctors recommend it ""off label"" in addition to hormonal therapy to manage endometriosis pain, as long as you aren’t planning to get pregnant while on this treatment."
48,Horner Syndrome,"What Is Horner Syndrome? H orner syndrome is a rare condition that causes problems on one side of your face when the nerves there are damaged. It's also called Horner-Bernard syndrome or oculosympathetic palsy. You can get Horner syndrome at any age. In rare cases -- about 1 in 6,250 births -- a baby will be born with it. Horner Syndrome Symptoms These symptoms affect your eyes or face on the same side: No sweat on one side of your face A droopy upper eyelid ( ptosis ) A lower eyelid that’s slightly raised (inverse ptosis) A small pupil, the black circle in the middle of your eye (miosis) Pupils that are different sizes (anisocoria) A pupil that doesn’t open (dilate) widely or is slow to open in dim light A sunken or bloodshot eye You also can have pain or headaches , which happens more often in middle-aged men. Horner syndrome can be a sign of a serious health risk such as nerve damage . See your doctor if you notice any of its symptoms. Symptoms of Horner syndrome in children Children who get Horner syndrome before age 2 also can have: One iris, the colored circle around the pupil, that's a lighter color than the other (heterochromia iridis) A lack of flushing on one side of their face on hot days or after playing Horner Syndrome Causes In about 35% to 40% of cases, doctors aren’t sure what exactly causes Horner syndrome. Some researchers think it can be tied to your genes. Other times, it happens because of damage to a string of nerves (called a pathway) that helps control your eyes , heart rate , sweat, and blood pressure . One of three pathways may be involved in Horner syndrome: First order (central) This pathway involves the nerves that run from the hypothalamus in your brain to your chest, through your brain stem and spinal cord. Conditions that can affect it include: Sudden loss of blood to your brain stem Tumors on your hypothalamus Spinal cord lesions Stroke Damage to myelin (a thin sheath around your nerves) Second order (preganglionic) These nerves go from your chest to the top of your lungs and along the carotid artery in your neck. They might be affected by: Tumors in your upper lung or chest Injury or surgery to your neck or chest Third order (postganglionic) This path runs from your neck to your middle ear and eye. Things that can affect it include: Carotid artery lesions Middle ear infections Injury to the base of your skull Migraine or cluster headaches Neck or shoulder injuries during birth can cause Horner syndrome in some babies, but it's very rare. Babies born with damage to their aorta can also have it. And neuroblastoma , a type of cancer , can cause it in some kids. Only 5% of people who have Horner syndrome are born with it. Horner Syndrome Diagnosis Your doctor or an eye doctor ( ophthalmologist ) can do tests to check for Horner syndrome. They’ll do a physical exam and ask about your medical history to find out if you've had any illness or injury that could have caused nerve damage. Then, they’ll put drops in your eyes to see how your pupils react. Other tests may show a growth, damage, or injury that could cause Horner syndrome. The doctor might order one or more of these: X-rays MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). Powerful magnets and radio waves make detailed images. CT scan (computerized tomography). Several X-rays from different angles are put together to show a more complete picture. Carotid ultrasound. Sound waves make an image of your carotid artery. Your doctor also may want to test your blood or urine to check for any health problems that could cause nerve damage. Horner Syndrome Treatment There aren’t any treatments specifically for Horner syndrome. The best way to ease your symptoms is to treat the health problem that caused them. If you have a tumor or lesion, your doctor might remove it through surgery. You could also have radiation and chemotherapy."
49,What to Expect When Your Loved One Is Dying,"Each person's journey to death is unique. Some people have a very gradual decline; others will fade quickly. As death approaches, your role is to be present, provide comfort, and reassure your loved one with soothing words and actions that help maintain their comfort and dignity. Hospice Care When your loved one's health care team recognizes that they are likely within 6 months of dying, they may recommend switching to hospice , a more specialized care for people with a terminal illness who are expected to die. Your loved one will still get treatment for pain relief and comfort, but hospice also offers emotional and spiritual support for them as well as you and close family. Signs That Death Is Near There are changes you can expect to see as an adult body stops working. These are a normal part of dying. Children and teens have a similar process, but it can be harder to predict. They often stay fairly active and continue to ask a lot of tough-to-answer questions. 1 to 3 months before death , your loved one is likely to: Sleep or doze more Eat and drink less Withdraw from people and stop doing things they used to enjoy Talk less (but if they're a child, more) 1 to 2 weeks before death , the person may feel tired and drained all the time, so much that they don't leave their bed. They could have: Different sleep-wake patterns Little appetite and thirst Fewer and smaller bowel movements and less pee More pain Changes in blood pressure , breathing, and heart rate Body temperature ups and downs that may leave their skin cool, warm, moist, or pale Congested breathing from the buildup in the back of their throat Confusion or seem to be in a daze Breathing trouble can be distressing for family members, but often it isn't painful and can be managed. Pain can be treated, too. But your loved one may have a hard time taking medicine by mouth. Hallucinations and visions, especially of long-gone loved ones, can be comforting. If seeing and talking to someone who isn't there makes the person who's dying happier, you don't need to try to convince them that they aren't real. It may upset them and make them argue and fight with you. When death is within days or hours , your loved one may: Not want food or drink Stop peeing and having bowel movements Grimace, groan, or scowl from pain You may notice their: Eyes tear or glaze over Pulse and heartbeat are irregular or hard to feel or hear Body temperature drops Skin on their knees, feet, and hands turns a mottled bluish-purple (often in the last 24 hours) Breathing is interrupted by gasping and slows until it stops entirely If they're not already unconscious, your loved one may drift in and out. But they probably can still hear and feel. At the End In the last days or hours, your loved one may become restless and confused and have hallucinations so upsetting they may cry out, strike out, or try to climb out of bed. Stay with them. Try to keep them calm with soothing music and gentle touch. Sometimes medication helps. The room should be well lit, but not bright. Make it as quiet and peaceful as possible. Constantly assure them that you're there. Ironically, a loved one may also become clear-headed in their final hours. When to Say Good-bye One of the hardest decisions is when to call in people to say good-bye and to make memories for the future. Let family members and close friends know as soon as it's obvious that death is near. The care team can help you all prepare for what's coming, both what will happen to your loved one and your own physical and emotional reactions. Being together allows family members to support each other, too. Even though you've gathered, don't assume it means you'll be there at the end. Often the person doesn't die until those who sat with them for hours have left, as if they were unable to let go while the ones they loved were there. Help and Support Caregivers, families, and friends of someone who is dying can turn to: Family Caregiver Alliance Hospice Foundation of America National Caregivers Library National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization"
50,What Is Hospice Care?,"During an illness that is terminal, you or your loved ones may talk with your doctor and decide the treatments meant to cure or slow a disease are no longer working, or you’re ready to stop them. Your doctor can make a referral for hospice care, also known as end-of-life care. You want relief from pain, shortness of breath, and other symptoms so that you can focus on the people and things you care about the most. That's when hospice, or end-of-life care, may help. Some people might think using hospice means they're giving up. Others may worry that they won’t get the medical care they need. But the service simply focuses on the quality of your life instead of trying to cure a disease. Your team may include a doctor, nurse, social worker, counselor, chaplain (if you’re religious), home health aide, and trained volunteers. They work together to meet your physical, emotional, and spiritual needs. Hospice is for family members, too. It offers counseling and help with practical things such as cleaning house and shopping. When Can I Join Hospice Care? You may enter a program if your doctor states that you have a terminal illness and that death can be expected in 6 months or less. You can stay in hospice beyond that time if your doctor and the team decide you still have only a short time to live. Hospice isn't always a permanent choice. For example, if your kidneys are failing, you might choose the hospice program rather than continuing with dialysis. But you can still change your mind, stop hospice care, and start back on treatments. Other people may get better unexpectedly and quit the service with the option of returning later. Hospice differs from palliative care, which serves anyone who is seriously ill, not just those who are dying and no longer seeking a cure. Can I Stay at Home -- and Should I? Hospice offers four levels of care, two of which happen at home. The four levels are: Routine Home Care. The most common level of hospice care, this includes nursing and home health aide services. Continuous Home Care. This is when a patient needs continuous nursing care during a time of crisis. General Inpatient Care. Short-term care during times when pain and symptoms can’t be managed without a hospital setting. Respite Care. Short-term care in a facility during times when the patient’s caregiver needs a break in caregiving. You might decide you or your loved one wishes to stay where friends and family can visit freely. In fact, most people choose this option. A relative or friend usually serves as the primary caregiver. You may also get care at hospice centers, hospitals, nursing homes, and other long-term care places. You might want to think about these questions when deciding whether to stay at home: Just how ill is the person needing care and how do they feel? Can any pain be managed away from a hospital or nursing home? Is the main caregiver physically and emotionally able to provide what’s needed from home? If you are a caregiver and work, can you afford to cut back on your hours at work or leave your job? Will you be able to get the extra supplies you might need, such as a bedside commode or a wheelchair? Your decision is personal, and each situation is different. But how you answer questions such as these will help you decide where to go. What Happens Once I’m in Hospice? Your team will come up with a special plan just for you and your loved ones. They will focus on making your pain and symptoms better. They will check on you regularly, and a member of the team is on call 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. A doctor -- either your own or one connected with a program -- will give medical care. Nurses will also check on you. Aides will assist with things such as bathing, dressing, cleaning, and cooking. Other services that are available include: Chaplain and spiritual services for you and your loved ones Social work and counseling Medicine to ease pain Medical equipment and supplies Advice on eating Physical and speech therapy Counseling for your loved ones How Do I Find a Program? Start by asking doctors, nurses, social workers, and friends for ideas. On the Internet, you can go to the website of the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization . You can call the NHPCO at 800-658-8898. For languages other than English, call 877-658-8896. You’ll want to ask the hospice what’s the role of your own doctor once care begins and whether the same nurse will visit during the week. Here are some other questions you might want to ask: Is the program certified, licensed, and reviewed by the federal government or my state? How fast does the staff respond if my loved one has a problem with pain or trouble breathing? Is there a program to give caregivers some time away for errands or rest? Do staffers and volunteers get screening and training before they come into our home? How will I pay for this? Will insurance or Medicare cover part or all of this? How does hospice help us with grief and loss?"
51,How to Allergy-Proof Your World,"Medicines help treat allergy symptoms once they strike. But these easy steps can help you avoid having an attack no matter where you are. At Home Keep windows closed and run the air conditioner if you're allergic to pollen. Don't use fans -- they can stir up dust. Filter the air. Cover air conditioning vents with cheesecloth to trap pollen. Use HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) filters, and clean them often. Hire someone to clean out your air ducts at least once a year. Keep the humidity in your home below 50% to help prevent mold growth. If you have pets, consider keeping them outside. If your allergies are severe, you might ask someone else to take care of them. Animal dander and saliva are common allergens for many people. If you decide to keep your pets inside, don’t let them in your bedroom. Bathe them often, too. Avoid areas where mold can collect, like basements, garages, crawl spaces, barns, and compost heaps. Have someone else clean these areas often. Install dehumidifiers in your basement and other parts of the home where mold grows. Clean these devices every week. Get mold testing kits from a big-box store or hardware store. They’re easy to use and will tell you how much mold is in your home. If there’s a lot, you can work to get rid of it, especially in the rooms where you spend most of your time. Air out damp clothes and shoes inside before you store them. Remove laundry from the washing machine promptly. Don't leave wet clothes in the washer, where mold can quickly grow. Make sure your clothes dryer is vented to the outside. Wash shower curtains and bathroom tiles with mold-killing solutions. Don't collect too many indoor plants. Soil encourages mold growth. Store firewood outside. Use plastic covers for pillows, mattresses, and box springs. Avoid overstuffed furniture and down-filled bedding or pillows. Wash your bedding every week in hot water. Don't allow anyone to smoke in your home. Skip the scented products. Cologne, cleaning supplies, potpourri, and beauty products with fragrance can cause an allergic reaction. Wear a mask and gloves when you clean, vacuum, or paint. That will limit your exposure to dust and chemicals. Don't use cleaning sprays that can leave chemicals hanging in the air. Consider “green” cleaners like white vinegar or a baking soda paste. Vacuum once or twice a week. Limit how many throw rugs you keep to reduce dust and mold. If you do have them, make sure you can wash them. When possible, choose hardwood floors. If you must have carpeting, go with a low-pile option. Avoid dust-collecting Venetian blinds or long drapes. Replace old window coverings with shades or shutters. Install an exhaust fan over your stove to remove cooking fumes. In the Car Keep windows closed, and set the air conditioner to use recirculated air if you’re allergic to pollen. Don't let anyone smoke. In the Great Outdoors Take fewer walks in wooded areas or gardens. Check the forecast. Stay indoors as much as possible on hot, dry, windy days, when pollen counts are highest. Try to avoid extreme temperature changes -- they can trigger asthma. If you can, stay inside between 5 and 10 a.m., when outdoor pollen counts are highest. Wear a mask (a cheap painter's mask is OK) when you mow if you’re allergic to grass pollen or mold. But skip the task if someone else can do it. It smells great, but keep your distance from freshly cut grass, too, if you can. Wear a mask in the garden. Flowers and weeds give off pollen. Wear a baseball cap to protect your scalp and face from pollen. Don’t rake leaves or work with hay or mulch if you’re allergic to mold. When you come back inside, take a shower, wash your hair, and change your clothes. That’ll get rid of pollen that may have collected in your clothes and hair. To protect yourself from insect stings, wear shoes, long pants, and sleeves. Don’t use scented deodorants, perfumes, shampoos, or hair products. If you have severe allergies and your doctor has prescribed an epinephrine injector kit, carry it with you at all times. Don't hang clothes or linens out to dry. They’ll collect pollen and mold. Traveling Pack medicines in your carry-on bag. Bring an extra supply of meds in case you need them. Check the pollen counts at your destination. Locate the nearest hospital or urgent care center. You probably won't need it, but it may make you feel better. If you have food allergies , pack safe snacks in your carry-on so you won't have to take a chance on airline food or things you buy in in train stations, rest stops, and airports. Book an early flight. Allergen levels tend to be lowest in the morning because most airlines clean their planes at the end of the business day. In a Hotel Ask for a nonsmoking room. Some hotels even offer asthma - and allergy-friendly rooms. Ask about the hotel's pet policy. If you have dander allergies , you probably don't want to stay in one that calls itself pet-friendly. Choose a hotel that offers rooms with kitchens so you can prepare your own meals allergen-free. Remove feather pillows and ask for synthetic, nonallergenic pillows. Or bring your own plastic pillow cover from home. If possible, keep the vent on the room air conditioner shut. Out for Dinner Choose smoke-free restaurants. Avoid ingredients that trigger your food allergies. Read menus carefully, and ask your sever how the dish is made. Choose fresh foods over prepared or processed ones. If you have an epinephrine shot kit, keep it with you at all times. If your doctor has prescribed two, keep them both nearby. At Your Kid’s School Discuss your child's allergies with the staff. If they have food allergies, tell the front office, their teachers, and lunchroom workers. Teach your child about their allergies early. That’ll make them less likely to eat something that will trigger an allergic reaction. Leave one or two epinephrine kits at the school. Make sure the staff -- and your child, when they are old enough -- are able to use it correctly. Tell them about any other medicines your child is taking. Make sure the school has doses of anything they need. Have your child tell you when they have symptoms at school, so you can try to track down what’s causing them. Encourage them to play sports, but let their coaches know if they need to take medicine before they hit the field. On high-pollen days, give your child medication before they go to school. Have them wear a hat during recess or P.E., and teach them to wash their face and hands when they come inside. Ask their teachers if they can keep the windows closed."
52,Allergies: Basic Info You Need to Know,"What Is an Allergy? Airborne allergens, such as pollen, can be a major trigger for allergies. (Photo Credit: iStock/Getty Images) You get allergies when your immune system responds to substances such as pollen, pet dander, or certain foods. Your antibodies identify these allergens as bad for you, even though they're not. How common are they? Nearly 18 million adults in the United States have hay fever, or allergic rhinitis. At least 1 in 3 American adults and 1 in 4 children have allergies. Doctors don’t know exactly how many adults are diagnosed with allergies for the first time. But nasal allergies affect more Americans every year, according to the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology. Whatever the case, allergies are all over, and they’re big business. They’re the sixth-leading cause of chronic illness in the U.S., according to the CDC. And they cost Americans more than $18 billion a year. Allergic Reactions Allergic reactions happen when you come into contact with an allergen. Your immune system reacts by releasing histamines and other chemicals into your blood, causing symptoms that can irritate your skin, sinuses, or digestive system. Common allergens include: Airborne allergens : Pollen, pet dander, dust mites, mold Certain foods : Peanuts, tree nuts, shellfish, eggs, and dairy Insect stings : Bees and wasps Medications Latex Allergy Symptoms Your allergy symptoms will vary, depending on what you're allergic to and how you’re exposed. Allergens can enter your body in several ways: Through your nasal passages and into your lungs Through your mouth Through your skin Through absorption from an insect sting If you have a mild allergic reaction, common symptoms might be: Itchy, watery eyes Sneezing Itchy, runny nose Feeling tired or ill Rashes and hives Symptoms of a food allergy could include: Tingling in your mouth Swelling of your lips, tongue, face, or throat Hives Stomach cramps , vomiting, or diarrhea Anaphylaxis An allergic reaction to an insect sting might cause any of these: Swelling, redness, and pain at the site of the sting Itching or hives Chest discomfort or tightness Coughing Anaphylaxis A severe allergic reaction could produce problems such as: Belly pain Anxiety Chest tightness Coughing Diarrhea A hard time breathing or swallowing Dizziness Swelling of the face, eyes, or tongue Anaphylaxis If you have any of these severe symptoms, call your doctor or seek medical help right away. Is It Anaphylaxis? Some allergic reactions are mild, but others can produce life-threatening problems, including anaphylaxis, which is a whole-body allergic reaction. You have to treat anaphylaxis with epinephrine (adrenaline) within minutes. If you have an epinephrine auto-injector, use it and repeat after 5 to 15 minutes if your symptoms haven’t improved. You still need to get medical care after using an EpiPen, even if you get better. Signs of anaphylaxis include: Hives and itching all over Wheezing or shortness of breath Hoarseness or tightness in your throat Swelling of your face, eyelids, lips, tongue , or throat Tingling in your hands, feet, lips, or scalp If you have any signs of anaphylaxis, call 911. Testing for Allergies An allergy test measures how your body responds to certain triggers. If your immune system overreacts, you have an allergy. Your body will produce antibodies called immunoglobulin E (IgE). There are different types of allergy tests. Which one your doctor chooses depends on your symptoms and the suspected causes. Skin-prick or scratch test Your health care provider will use a thin needle that contains an allergen to prick your skin. Or they might put droplets of allergens on your skin and then scratch your skin so the allergens can get in. The test could use your forearm or back. If you're allergic, within 15 minutes, a rash or raised spots – called wheals – will appear. You might be tested for many allergies at once. Intradermal skin test If the skin-prick test doesn't yield enough information, your doctor may try this test next. A small amount of an allergen is injected into the outer layer of your skin. The doctor is looking for a rash or other reaction. Patch test This checks for contact dermatitis, a reaction that happens when your skin comes in contact with an allergen. Your health care provider puts drops of an allergen on the surface of your skin and covers the spot with a bandage. Or the allergen may be on the bandage itself. You leave the bandage in place for at least 2 days. Then you go back to your doctor, who removes the bandage and checks for a reaction. Blood test Your health care provider draws a blood sample and sends it to a lab. At the lab, allergens are added to your blood, and then it's tested for levels of IgE antibodies. This test has a higher rate of false positives, indicating you have an allergy when you really don't. Challenge test Typically, an allergy specialist, called an allergist, does this test. You'll swallow a small amount of a suspected allergen – a food or drug – while a health care provider closely watches you in case you get anaphylaxis. If you do, you'll get an epinephrine shot right away to stop the reaction. To prepare for an allergy test, you'll need to stop your allergy medication 3 to 7 days ahead of time. Those drugs can interfere with the test. Allergies and Your Diet There is no cure for allergies, including what you eat. But your diet might help with how bad your symptoms get. Here are some of the foods that researchers are studying to see if they might help ease allergies. Good fats Researchers are studying whether polyunsaturated fatty acids such as omega-3s can help prevent allergies in children. Foods such as salmon, mackerel, tuna, flaxseeds, chia seeds, and walnuts are high in omega-3s, which help ease inflammation. Researchers think eating these may lower the risk of childhood asthma and allergy. In one Swedish study, children who had higher levels of these fatty acids in their blood at age 8 were less likely to have nasal allergies by age 16. But more research is needed to confirm if that is because of the polyunsaturated fatty acids in their diets or something else. Mediterranean diet A large study of children in Crete (part of Greece) found that children who stuck to a Mediterranean diet full of fruits, vegetables, whole-grain breads and cereals, and legumes and nuts were less likely to have hay fever. Allergy Management Steps you can take to help control your allergies include: Avoid the allergens, if you can. Take allergy medicines . Consider allergy shots (immunotherapy), which can reduce your immune system's response. To get the most benefit, you'll need to take allergy shots for 3 to 5 years. This can be an expensive option, but it offers the best hope of long-term relief. The effects can last even after you stop taking the shots."
53,"Chickenpox (Varicella): Symptoms, Causes, Prevention","What is Chickenpox? Chickenpox is a very contagious infection caused by the varicella-zoster virus. It mainly affects kids, but adults can also get it. The telltale sign of chickenpox is a super-itchy skin rash with blisters. Over the course of several days, the blisters pop and start to leak. Then they crust and scab over before finally healing. Chickenpox is generally mild, especially in children. Chickenpox is an extremely contagious infection caused by the varicella-zoster virus that causes you to get a very itchy rash. (Photo credit: E+/Getty Images) Chickenpox Causes Chickenpox is caused by the varicella-zoster virus and spreads easily and quickly from someone who is infected. Who Gets Chickenpox? Children under age 2 are most at risk for chickenpox. In fact, 90% of all cases occur in young children. But older children and adults can get it too. How Do You Get Chickenpox? If someone has the virus and you touch their rash or fluid from their blisters, you can get chickenpox. The virus can also spread to you if someone with chickenpox coughs or sneezes and you breathe in droplets. When you have chickenpox, you are contagious from 1 to 2 days before the rash appears until all your blisters have dried and crusted over. Chickenpox incubation period On average, your symptoms will appear within 10 to 21 days after you have been exposed to the virus. Chickenpox Symptoms The first sign of chickenpox is usually a general feeling of not feeling well. Early-stage chickenpox Some other symptoms of chickenpox that can happen a few days before the rash include: Body aches Fever Feeling very tired Loss of appetite Headache Chickenpox rash Within a day or two, you’ll develop the most common symptom of chickenpox, which is an itchy rash. It usually shows up on your face, chest, and back first, but the spots can spread to the rest of your body. In severe cases, they can form in your mouth, eyes, anus, or genitals. It happens in three phases. During the first phase, you’ll develop itchy, raised bumps. They may be pink or red or the same color as your skin or darker. Doctors call these “papules.” As many as 250 to 500 of them can pop up all over your body. New bumps will appear for several days. In the next phase, these bumps will turn into small, fluid-filled blisters called “vesicles.” They last about a day before they pop and start to leak. Finally, these open wounds crust over and turn into scabs. As they heal, new bumps continue to appear. You could have bumps, blisters, and scabs at the same time. You can spread the virus to other people until all the spots crust over. How long does chickenpox last? Chickenpox symptoms usually last about 4-7 days. Chickenpox Diagnosis Your doctor will likely be able to tell if you have chickenpox by looking at your rash. If there is any doubt, they can do a test. Because chickenpox is highly contagious, call your doctor before going to the office. Mpox vs. chickenpox Mpox (previously known as monkeypox) and chickenpox are caused by two different viruses. With both, you will probably get a fever and you will have fluid-filled blisters, but there are differences between the two infections. Mpox spots appear all at once while chickenpox spots show up over several days. Mpox sores are typically larger and deeper than chickenpox. Mpox blisters can be painful, chickenpox blisters are just itchy. All your mpox spots will blister and then crust over at the same time. With chickenpox, you may have spots, blisters, and crusted sores at the same time. Mpox lasts longer than chickenpox. Chickenpox in Adults Most cases of chickenpox occur in young children, but adults and older children can get it too. When adults get chickenpox, they often have more severe cases and are more likely to have complications. You’re more at risk for chickenpox if you: Haven’t had the virus before Haven’t been vaccinated for it Work in a school or child care facility Live with children Chickenpox Treatment Medications can help if you have chickenpox. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) If you or your child has a high fever or achiness caused by chickenpox, reach for acetaminophen. It can help relieve pain from sores that develop on your skin or in your mouth, too. It’s safe for most people, including pregnant women. For children over 2 months old, use a product specifically made for them and read the instructions for dosing information. If your child has chickenpox, avoid anti-inflammatory painkillers like ibuprofen because they can be associated with a serious bacterial skin infection. Never give aspirin to children under age 16. It can lead to a serious complication called Reye’s syndrome that can affect the liver and brain and sometimes cause death. Prescription medicine If you’ve been exposed to someone who has chickenpox but don’t have symptoms yet, your doctor may give you an injection of a treatment called immune globulin. It can help your immune system fight chickenpox. Your doctor may consider this medication if you fall into one of the following groups: Children and adults with weakened immune systems Newborns of mothers with chickenpox shortly before or after delivery Premature babies Babies less than 1 year old Adults without evidence of immunity Pregnant A smoker Living with HIV Having chemotherapy (“chemo”) or taking high doses of steroid medication Newborn babies under 4 weeks old are also at increased risk for complications from chickenpox. If you’re at risk for severe chickenpox and already have symptoms, your doctor might prescribe an antiviral medication called acyclovir (Sitavig, Zovirax). It can help make your symptoms less severe if you begin the first dose within 24 hours of developing the rash. Don’t scratch Scratching your rash can put you at risk for a bacterial skin infection . It could also cause scarring. If you accidentally scratch your rash, wash your hands with soap and water so you don’t spread the virus. Can you get chickenpox twice? You can get chickenpox again if you’ve already had it, but it’s not common. . Chickenpox Home Remedies There are things you can do at home to ease your symptoms while your body heals. To try a home remedy that might provide chickenpox relief, you can: Take a lukewarm bath with colloidal oatmeal or baking soda. Dab calamine lotion on your itchy spots. Take an oral antihistamine to help with itching. Get plenty of rest. It's also important to: Keep cool Heat and sweat make you itch more. Use a cool, wet washcloth on super-itchy areas to calm your skin. Stay hydrated Drink lots of fluids to help your body rid itself of the virus faster. It’ll also keep you from getting dehydrated. Choose water over sugary drinks or sodas, especially if you or your child has chickenpox in the mouth . Sugar-free frozen pops are a good choice, too. Avoid hard, spicy, or salty foods that can make your mouth sore. Chickenpox Complications Adults have a higher risk for developing complications from chickenpox than children. Those with weakened immune systems due to cancer, HIV, or another condition are also at risk. Once you’ve had chickenpox, the varicella-zoster virus stays in your nerve cells for years. It can “wake up” and become active again years later. It can lead to shingles, a condition that happens when the virus, which stays in your body, turns back on . Shingles causes painful blisters. Fortunately, there’s a vaccine for shingles. The CDC recommends two doses of recombinant zoster vaccine for prevention of shingles and similar complications in adults ages 50 years and older. A version of the vaccine is also recommended for people with weakened immune systems ages 19 years and older. Other complications from chickenpox include: Dehydration Infections caused by bacteria Toxic shock syndrome Brain swelling (encephalitis) or Swelling of the brain and liver in children and teens with chicken pox who take aspirin (Reye's syndrome) Pneumonia Death (very rare) Chickenpox Vaccine The best way to prevent the spread of the virus is to get the varicella vaccine . Children who’ve never had chickenpox should get two doses of the vaccine -- the first at 12 to 15 months of age, and the second between ages 4 and 6. People over age 13 who’ve never been vaccinated should get two doses of the vaccine at least 28 days apart. If you are pregnant, have a disease that affects the immune system, have been taking medication that impacts the immune system for 2 weeks or more, have cancer, are receiving radiation or chemotherapy, or recently had a blood transfusion or received other blood products, ask your doctor before getting the vaccine. If you are over the age of 50 and have had chickenpox, a high-dose vaccine called Shingrix is available to prevent painful outbreaks of shingles. If you are over 19 years old with a weakened immune system, ask your doctor if you should get the shingles vaccine. Chickenpox Prevention After the vaccine, the best way to prevent chickenpox is to avoid being around people with chickenpox. When to See a Doctor Most cases of chickenpox are mild and go away on their own. If you have chickenpox but are otherwise healthy, call your doctor right away if you develop any of the following symptoms: The rash gets close to or spreads to one or both eyes. The rash gets very red, warm, or tender. You could have a bacterial skin infection. Bleeding or bruising around your rash Dizziness Shortness of breath Bad cough Bad stomach pain Vomiting Stiff neck You can’t control your muscles Trouble walking Trouble waking up Confusion Fever lasting more than four days Fever over 102 F Dehydration"
54,Asthma and the Peak Flow Meter,"A peak flow meter is an inexpensive, portable, handheld device for those with asthma that is used to measure how well air moves out of your lungs . Measuring your peak flow using this meter is an important part of managing your asthma symptoms and preventing an asthma attack . The peak flow meter works by measuring how fast air comes out of the lungs when you exhale forcefully after inhaling fully. This measure is called a ""peak expiratory flow,"" or ""PEF."" Keeping track of your PEF, is one way you can know if your symptoms of asthma are in control or worsening. Why Use a Peak Flow Meter? Readings from a peak flow meter can help you or your child recognize early changes that may be signs of worsening asthma . During an asthma attack, the smooth muscles that surround the airways tighten and cause the airways to narrow. The peak flow meter alerts you to the tightening of the airways often hours or even days before you have any asthma symptoms. By using your PEF with your asthma action plan , you will know when to take your rescue (quick acting) asthma inhaler or other asthma medicine. By following the steps in your asthma action plan, you may be able to stop the narrowing of the airways quickly and avoid a severe asthma emergency . The peak flow meter can also be used to help you: Learn what triggers your asthma Decide if your asthma action plan is working Decide when to add or adjust asthma medications Know when to seek emergency care It is important to know that your peak flow meter only measures the amount of airflow out of the large airways of the lungs. Changes in airflow caused by the small airways (which also occur with asthma) will not be detected by a peak flow meter. Early warning signs, however, may be present. Therefore, it is important for you to also be aware of your symptoms and early warning signs to best manage your asthma. Who Should Use a Peak Flow Meter? Peak flow meters are very helpful if you or your child have moderate to severe asthma and require daily asthma medications. Even most children ages 6 and up should be able to use a peak flow meter with good results. People with moderate-to-severe asthma should have a peak flow meter at home. How Do I Use the Peak Flow Meter for Asthma? A peak flow meter is simple to use for tracking your asthma. Here's what you do: Stand up or sit up straight. Make sure the indicator is at the bottom of the meter (zero). Take a deep breath in, filling the lungs completely. Place the mouthpiece in your mouth; lightly bite with your teeth and close your lips on it. Be sure your tongue is away from the mouthpiece. Blast the air out as hard and as fast as possible in a single blow. Remove the meter from your mouth . Record the number that appears on the meter and then repeat steps one through seven two more times. Record the highest of the three readings in an asthma diary . This reading is your peak expiratory flow (PEF). To ensure the results of your peak flow meter are comparable, be sure to use your meter the same way each time you take a reading. How Often Should I Check my Peak Flow? Peak flow values are best if they are checked at the same time each day, preferably once in the morning and again at night. Ask your doctor how often you should check your peak flow. How Do I Determine My ""Personal Best"" Peak Flow Number? The ""personal best"" peak expiratory flow (PEF) is the highest peak flow number you or your child can achieve over a two to three week period when asthma is under good control. Good control means you feel good and do not have any asthma symptoms. Your personal best PEF is important because it is the number to which all of your other peak flow readings will be compared. Your asthma action plan, developed along with your asthma doctor , is based on this number. To find your personal best peak flow number, take peak flow readings: Twice a day for two to three weeks when asthma is in good control At the same time in the morning and in the early evening As instructed by your doctor or asthma care provider You should always use the same meter. Once you have determined your or your child's personal best PEF, work with your asthma care provider to determine at what point you should start taking quick-relief drugs to relieve an asthma attack or seek emergency medical attention. These are called your asthma peak flow zones. All of this information should be recorded in your personal asthma action plan. Then, continue to take peak flow readings each morning. Daily readings will help you: Recognize early drops in airflow Know when your child's personal best improves naturally as they grow If your PEF drops below 80% of your personal best, follow your asthma action plan and check PEF more frequently that day or as directed by your doctor. Seek immediate help before your asthma symptoms worsen."
55,How to Remove a Tick,"Everyone and their uncle has a favorite method for removing a tick -- from burning it with a cigarette to smothering it in petroleum jelly or painting it with nail polish. But that’s not how you should go about it. To safely remove a tick, all you really need is a pair of pointy tweezers and a good eye . Remove Ticks the Right Way Before you dive in, you’ll want to get: Pointy tweezers Rubbing alcohol (If you don’t have it, soap and water works, too) Pointy tweezers aren’t the typical household tweezers that you use to pluck your eyebrows. You want pointy tips, not squared-off ones. Ticks can be as small as poppy seeds. If you use regular tweezers, you might tear them. Once you have your tools, here’s what to do: Clean the area around the tick bite with rubbing alcohol. Get your tweezers right down on your skin so you can grab as close as possible to the tick’s head. Pull up slow and firm. Don’t jerk or twist; a nice, steady pressure straight up will do. Clean the bite area again, and your hands, with rubbing alcohol or soap and water. And that’s it. If the part of the head breaks off when you pull the tick out, that’s OK. You can try to remove it with tweezers, but if you can’t, it’s no problem. Your skin will heal. What Do I Do With the Extracted Tick? You have two options: Get it tested or get rid of it. Send a tick for testing: It can help to get the tick tested so you’ll know if it was carrying any diseases it might have given you. To do this, place it in a sealed container along with a blade of grass to keep it alive. Then, take it for testing. Some state agencies do tick testing, but if you’re not sure where to send the tick, ask your doctor. Get rid of a tick: If you just want it safely out of your life, you can: Drown it in a container with rubbing alcohol or soapy water Flush it down the toilet Wrap it tightly in tape, then throw it out Whatever you do, avoid the temptation to crush it with your fingers. This is another way you can get disease from it. When Should I Call My Doctor? Call your doctor if you have any symptoms of Lyme or other diseases carried by ticks, such as: Chills Fever Headache Muscle aches Rash Make sure to tell your doctor that you had a tick bite, how long ago it happened, and where you might have gotten it. This is a good reason to get the tested. Tick diseases have similar symptoms to each other and to a lot of other illnesses. It can help to know what it was carrying."
56,Head Injury,"Head injuries are damage to the scalp, skull, or brain caused by trauma. When it affects the brain, they’re called  a traumatic brain injury, or TBI. To most people, head injuries are considered an acceptable risk when engaging in sports and other types of recreational activities. But they’re dangerous. They can lead to permanent disability, mental impairment, and even death. There are steps you can take to lower the risk and protect yourself and your children. Types of Head Injuries There are many different types of head injuries. Concussion. This is the most common type of head injury. A concussion is a type of traumatic brain injury (TBI) that happens when the brain is jarred or shaken hard enough to bounce against the skull. It can range from mild to severe. You don't have to be hit in the head to get a concussion. An impact elsewhere on the body can create enough force to jar the brain. Contusion . A bruise on the actual brain itself is called a contusion. It can cause bleeding and swelling. Intracranial hematoma (ICH) . This is bleeding under the skull in the brain that forms a clot. Brain hematomas range from mild to severe and are grouped according to where they form. Skull fracture . Sometimes, a broken skull bone can affect the brain. The broken pieces of bone can cut into the brain and cause bleeding and other types of injury. Head Injury Causes The most common causes of head injuries are: Car or motorcycle accidents Falls Child abuse Acts of violence A concussion or other head injury can also happen when two athletes collide or a player is hit in the head with a piece of sporting equipment. In soccer, even ""heading"" the ball can cause a concussion. Among the sports-related activities that cause the highest number of head injuries for all ages: Cycling Football Basketball Baseball and softball Riding powered recreational vehicles such as dune buggies, go-karts, and mini bikes According to the Brain Injury Association of America, the five leading activities that cause  concussions in children and adolescents aged 5-18 years of age are: Cycling Football Basketball Playground activities Soccer Sports activities and trauma aren’t always the cause of head injuries. Contusions or brain hemorrhages can have other causes, such as: Long-term high blood pressure (in adults) Bleeding disorders Use of blood thinners or certain recreational drugs Head Injury Signs and Symptoms Signs and symptoms of a concussion may show up immediately, or they can take hours or even days to show up. You don’t always lose consciousness with a concussion. A concussion causes changes in a person's mental status and can disrupt the normal functioning of the brain. Multiple concussions can have a long-lasting, life-changing effect. Signs of a TBI, like a concussion, include: Confusion Depression Dizziness or balance problems Double or fuzzy vision Feeling foggy or groggy Feeling sluggish or tired Headache Memory loss Nausea Sensitivity to light or noise Sleep disturbance Trouble concentrating Trouble remembering Signs or symptoms that a head injury may be more than a concussion and requires emergency treatment include: Changes in size of pupils Clear or bloody fluid draining from the nose, mouth , or ears Convulsions Distorted facial features Facial bruising Fracture in the skull or face Impaired hearing, smell, taste, or vision Inability to move one or more limbs Irritability Lightheadedness Loss of consciousness Low breathing rate Restlessness, clumsiness, or lack of coordination Severe headache Slurred speech or blurred vision Stiff neck or vomiting Sudden worsening of symptoms after initial improvement Swelling at the site of the injury Persistent vomiting Head Injury Treatment If you think you may have a concussion or suspect that someone else has one, the most important step to take is to prevent further injury. Stop whatever activity you are involved in and tell someone you think you may have been injured. Then get medical attention. If you're playing as part of a team, ask to be taken out of the game and tell the coach what happened. If a fellow player has signs of being confused or a sudden loss of coordination, be sure to report this to a coach. If you are coaching a team and you notice a potential injury, take the person out of the game, and see that the person gets medical care. Receiving medical attention as soon as possible is important for any type of potentially moderate to severe TBI. Undiagnosed injuries that don't receive proper care can cause long-term disability and impairment. Keep in mind that although death from a sports injury is rare, brain injuries are the leading cause of sports-related deaths. Symptoms should be closely monitored often with a moderate to severe injury. It may require an overnight stay in the hospital. A doctor may take X-rays to check for potential skull fracture and stability of the spine. In some cases the doctor may ask for a CT scan or an MRI to check on the extent of the damage that occurred. More severe injuries may need surgery to relieve pressure from swelling. If a child sustains a head injury, don’t automatically have them X-rayed. Monitor them carefully for age appropriate symptoms of a TBI such as confusion or behavioral change. Don’t give them medications, including aspirin, without advice from your doctors. If the doctor sends you home with an injured person, they may instruct you to watch that person closely. That may involve waking the person every few hours to ask questions such as ""What's your name?"" or ""Where are you?"" to be sure the person is OK. Be sure you've asked the doctor and understand what symptoms to watch for and which ones require immediate attention. Guidelines urge doctors not allow someone who has been injured to return to activity that involves risk of further injury until completely free of symptoms. Most teens recover within two weeks, while it may take younger children up to four weeks to recover. But symptoms of severe injury could persist for months or even years. A person with a moderate to serious injury will likely require rehabilitation that may include physical and occupational therapy , speech and language therapy, medication , psychological counseling, and social support. Head Injury Risk Prevention The most important step to take is to buy and properly use protective head gear that has been approved by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM). Be sure to buy the right size for a proper fit and to wear the helmet or headgear properly. According to the American Association of Neurological Surgeons, helmets or headgear should be worn at all times for the following activities: Baseball and softball Cycling Football Hockey Horseback riding Riding powered recreational vehicles Skateboarding and riding scooters Skiing Snowboarding Wrestling In addition, the FDA has approved the noninvasive device, called Q-Collar which can be worn by athletes to help prevent head injuries. The C-shaped collar applies compressive force to the neck and increases blood volume to help reduce movement of the brain, which may occur because of hits to the head. The device may reduce specific changes in the brain that are associated with brain injury. Other things you can do to keep yourself and your kids safer: Wear light-reflecting clothes when riding a bike at night. Don't dive in water less than 12 feet deep or any body of water where you cannot see the bottom, murky water. Make sure that children's play areas and equipment are safe and in good repair. Don't let children play sports that are inappropriate for their age. Supervise and teach children how to properly use sports equipment. Don't wear clothing that interferes with vision . Follow all rules at water parks and swimming pools. Don't skateboard or cycle on uneven or unpaved surfaces. Don't play sports when you are tired or very ill."
57,What Are the Treatments for Alcohol Use Disorder?,"Alcohol use disorder is what doctors call it when you can’t control how much you drink and have trouble with your emotions when you’re not drinking. Some people may think the only way to deal with it is with willpower , as if it’s a problem they have to work through all on their own. But alcohol use disorder is actually a brain disease . Alcohol causes changes in your brain that make it hard to quit. Trying to tough it out on your own can be like trying to cure appendicitis with cheerful thoughts. An important first step is to learn more about alcohol use disorder and your treatment options. Find Out if You’re Misusing Alcohol Alcoholism is a common and different term for alcohol use disorder. Milder cases -- when people abuse alcohol but aren’t dependent on it -- are as well. Your doctor or another health care provider can help with the diagnosis. They may say you have alcohol use disorder if you: Feel like you have to drink Can’t control how much you drink Feel bad when you can’t drink When you meet with your doctor, talk about your goals. Are you trying to drink less or stop drinking completely? Together, you can start to make a treatment plan. You doctor also can refer you to a treatment center or experts who can help. Treatment Options The one that’s right for you depends on your situation and your goals. Many people find that a combination of treatments works best, and you can get them together through a program. Some of these are inpatient or residential programs, where you stay at a treatment center for a while. Others are outpatient programs, where you live at home and go to the center for treatment. Go to Detox This is a key step if your drinking problem is severe. Detox isn’t a treatment by itself. The goal is to stop drinking and give your body time to get the alcohol out of your system. That usually takes a few days to a week. Most people go to a hospital or treatment center because of withdrawal symptoms like: Shaking (tremors) Seeing or feeling things that aren’t really there ( hallucinations ) Seizures Doctors and other experts can keep an eye on you and give you medicine to help with your symptoms. You can go through detox in two main ways: Inpatient . This option may be best if you’ve been misusing alcohol heavily. You stay full time in a clinic, hospital, or a detox center. You’ll get around-the-clock help during your withdrawal. Outpatient . You visit with your doctor or health provider for treatment during the day. Outpatient rehab can be safe if your condition is mild or moderate. See a Counselor or Therapist During or after your alcohol rehabilitation, seeing a therapist can help you learn new skills and strategies to help you stay sober for the long term. Psychologists, social workers, or alcohol counselors can teach you how to: Change the behaviors that make you want to drink Deal with stress and other triggers Build a strong support system Set goals and reach them Some people just need a short, focused counseling session. Others may want one-on-one therapy for a longer time to deal with issues like anxiety or depression . Alcohol use can have a big effect on the people close to you, so couples or family therapy can help, too. Medications No medicine can “cure” alcohol use disorder, but some can help as you recover. They can make drinking less enjoyable so you don’t want to do it as much: Disulfiram ( Antabuse ) will make you feel sick or throw up if you drink. Acamprosate ( Campral ) can help with cravings. Naltrexone ( Revia ) blocks the high you get from drinking. Drugs used for other conditions -- like smoking , pain , or epilepsy -- also may help with alcohol use disorder. Talk to your doctor to see of one of those might be right for you. Find Support Giving up and staying away from alcohol can take persistence and hard work. Healthy habits and strategies for getting through daily life can be important to your recovery. Steps you can take include: Surround yourself with family, friends, and others who support your goal. Be clear that you’re no longer drinking Take care your body. Eat a health died, get plenty of sleep, stay active, and manage your stress Engage in activities and hobbies that don’t involve alcohol Join a Group Group therapy or a support group can help during rehab and help you stay on track as life gets back to normal. Group therapy, led by a therapist, can give you the benefits of therapy along with the support of other members. Support groups aren’t led by therapists. Instead, these are groups of people who have alcohol use disorder. Examples include Alcoholics Anonymous , SMART Recovery, and other programs. Your peers can offer understanding and advice and help keep you accountable. Many people stay in groups for years. What to Expect Recovery can take a long time, so you may need ongoing treatment. And some people in recovery do relapse and drink again. If you do, don’t think you’ve failed. It’s often a stage in the process."
58,Breaking the Thumb-Sucking Habit,"My 8-year-old, Michael, had me concerned. He was finishing up third grade and still sucked his thumb. ""What can I do to make him stop?"" I asked my pediatrician. His grandmother had been successful the previous summer at getting him to quit during a week-long stay at her house. Her remedy: Give him undivided grandma love and reward his efforts daily. Once home, the habit returned. ""Is finger-sucking normal at this age?"" I wanted to know. I found out it was not. Fortunately, the problem wasn't serious, but the solution would require patience and determination -- on my part and his. Most Infants Self-Pacify Most experts agree that a thumb-sucker younger than 5 shouldn't be pressured to stop. Most children will give up the habit on their own before they enter kindergarten. ""Thumb-sucking is an appropriate and useful behavior for very young children,"" says Linda Goldstein, MD, a Washington pediatrician. ""It allows them to comfort and entertain themselves."" In fact, more than three-quarters of infants suck their thumbs or fingers through the first year of life. A child usually turns to the thumb when bored, tired, or upset. It is not uncommon to see a thumb-sucker simultaneously engage in other behaviors, such as twirling a strand of hair , holding onto an ear, or rubbing a blankie. ""Even when the habit lingers past infancy, thumb-sucking is rarely something to be concerned about. It doesn't indicate that a child has emotional problems or that he will still be sucking his finger when he's a teenager,"" says Sabine Hack, MD, assistant professor of psychiatry at New York University School of Medicine. Reaching a Merciless Age As children move past toddlerhood and into the preschool years, the thumb-sucking crowd begins to dwindle. Nevertheless, one in five children will still be sucking his thumb or finger past his 5th birthday. ""This is the merciless age, the time when teasing begins. Parents begin to worry because the thumb-sucking is causing social difficulties for the child,"" Goldstein says. ""By kindergarten you'll find that kids don't want to play or sit next to a child who's a thumb-sucker."" Thumb-sucking also can lead to dental problems. A child who is still thumb-sucking by age 5, when permanent teeth start coming in, may develop an abnormal bite. Beyond a simple overbite , some children develop speech problems: troubles with the ""S"" sound and other "" tongue -tip"" sounds, according to Forrest Umberger, PhD, a professor of special education and communications disorders at Valdosta State University in Georgia. ""Many of our clients are referred to us by orthodontists,"" says Umberger, who has studied the role of thumb-sucking in muscle and facial pathology. ""The idea is not just to do a cosmetic fix but to help children correct the speech difficulties once the sucking habit is gone."" Prolonged finger-sucking also can cause minor physical problems like chapped skin , calluses , and fingernail infections. In Michael's case, the second finger on his right hand became shriveled up, and the nail barely grew. During winter the skin on that finger would become dry and cracked, which only seemed to make him want to suck it more. Support, Guidance Key ""If a child who is older than 5 or 6 is still sucking his thumb and having difficulty stopping, parents ought to think about what they can do to help him,"" Hack says. Before insisting that a child go ""cold turkey,"" it's important to observe how deeply entrenched your child's behavior is, she says. How often does your child suck and in front of whom? If it happens only at bedtime or in front of family members, it's a less serious problem than if it happens at school or in social situations. Attempts to steer a child away from thumb-sucking can backfire if they are not tempered with support and guidance. Don't nag or reprimand your child, and don't pull a child's finger out of his mouth. These kinds of actions can result in a power struggle, experts say. ""The truth is most kids over 6 really do want to stop, but they need some extra help,"" Goldstein says. Simple Treatment Plan Breaking a habit is a much easier feat when the child is a willing participant. Many parents have success with a simple behavioral approach that engages the child in the process. Here's how it works: First, says Hack, call a one-month moratorium on discussion. ""If finger-sucking is part of a power struggle, not mentioning it may help extinguish the behavior,"" she says. Next, buy poster board and stickers and make a ""progress chart."" Offer a prize at the end of each week for no sucking -- and a larger reward at the end of the month. Make sure that your child has an active role in the plan; for example, decide together how many slip-ups he's allowed each week and have him choose the stickers and place them on the chart. It may also be helpful to place a bitter-tasting liquid on the nail (not directly on the finger), especially at night, as a reminder not to suck. Products for this purpose are sold over the counter, but home remedies can be just as effective. What worked for Michael was perfume. Each night for two weeks, I asked him to choose a bottle of perfume from my collection. He would sniff them all, pick one, and I would place a dab at the tip of his finger. ""Yuck,"" he'd always say, but he clearly welcomed the crutch. Mittens, gloves, or a finger-splint may also be worn at night. It may take six weeks or more to successfully break the habit. Dentists Can Help, Too While your child is trying to change his or her behavior, it's essential to give lots of praise and support: an extra cuddle, a special outing, playing a new game together. Be aware of situations that might promote thumb-sucking, like TV or riding in the car. ""Use your imagination to guide your child to other means of solace that are more age-appropriate,"" Hack says. If this program doesn't work, don't despair. Breaking a longstanding habit is difficult and some children may need additional help. Talk to your child's dentist, who may recommend inserting a device in the child's mouth that prevents sucking. These oral appliances go by names like ""palatal bar"" and ""crib"" and come in fixed and removable versions. If the problem seems particularly resistant to treatment, this may be a signal that your child is troubled about a deeper problem, Goldstein says. In this case, you may want to seek the advice of a mental health professional."
59,"Neutropenia: Causes, Symptoms, Treatment","What Is Neutropenia? Neutropenia is a condition in which you have an unusually low number of cells called neutrophils in your blood. Neutrophils are a type of white blood cell in your immune system that attack bacteria and other organisms when they invade your body. Your bone marrow, which is tissue found in bones that makes cells, creates neutrophils. They then travel in your bloodstream and move to areas of infection where they are taken in and then cancel out bacteria. Having a lower than normal number of neutrophils in your blood can make it harder to fight germs and prevent infections. Neutropenia is a condition that happens when you have an unusually low number of cells called neutrophils, which are a type of white blood cell, in your blood. Having a lower than normal number of neutrophils in your blood can make it harder to fight germs and prevent infections. (Photo credit: Viktoriia Kasyanyuk/Dreamstime) Types of Neutropenia Neutropenia can be temporary (acute) or last 3 months or more (chronic) and can affect both children and adults. There are four main types of neutropenia : Congenital neutropenia. This is a severe form of neutropenia that is seen most often in babies or very young children. When a condition is congenital, it means it is present at birth. The most serious form of chronic congenital neutropenia is called Kostmann's syndrome. In people with this condition, neutrophils in the bone marrow may not develop fully enough to fight infections. Idiopathic neutropenia. The term idiopathic means ""of unknown cause."" Idiopathic neutropenia affects children and adults. Cyclic neutropenia. This type of neutropenia usually occurs every 3 weeks and may last 3-6 days or longer. It affects both children and adults, sometimes within the same family. Cyclic neutropenia happens when the rate of cell production in a person's bone marrow rises and falls. Autoimmune neutropenia. This is the most common cause of neutropenia in infants and young children. Occasionally, it is seen in adults aged 20-40 years (mostly women). The condition causes the body's immune system to fight and destroy its own neutrophils. Febrile neutropenia. While not one of the four main types of neutropenia, febrile neutropenia is a serious side effect for people with cancer who are treated with chemotherapy. When your immune system is suppressed, an oral temperature of greater than 101 F or a fever of at least 100.4 F that lasts an hour or more can be a sign of a dangerous infection. Neutropenia Symptoms Neutropenia itself often doesn't cause symptoms. In some cases, people only learn they have neutropenia when they have a blood test for an unrelated reason. It is most commonly seen—and even expected—as a result of chemotherapy used to treat cancer. But some people may have other symptoms from an infection or underlying problem causing the neutropenia. Infections can occur as a complication of neutropenia. They occur most often in the mucous membranes, such as the inside of the mouth and the skin. These infections can appear as: Sore throat Swollen lymph nodes Ulcers around the mouth or your anus Burning sensation with pee or urgent and/or frequent need to pee Diarrhea Swollen areas filled with pus (abscesses) Pain, swelling, and/or rash where the infection is Long-lasting wounds Fatigue Fever is also a common symptom of infection. In a neutropenic fever, it's common not to know the exact cause, which is often normal gut bacteria that has made its way into the blood from weakened borders. Neutropenic fevers are usually treated with antibiotics , even if an infectious source can't be confirmed. This is important because the weakened immune system means people can get very sick very quickly. The risk of a serious infection generally raises as: Neutrophil count goes down Duration of severe neutropenia gets longer Neutropenia Causes Causes of neutropenia include: Problem in the production of neutrophils in the bone marrow Destruction of neutrophils outside the bone marrow Infection Nutritional deficiency Causes of lowered production of neutrophils include: Being born with a problem with bone marrow production (congenital) Leukemia and other conditions that affect the bone marrow or lead to bone marrow failure Radiation Chemotherapy Infections that can cause neutropenia include: Tuberculosis Dengue fever Viral infections such as Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, HIV, viral hepatitis Raised destruction of neutrophils can be due to viral infections or medications used to treat autoimmune disorders targeting neutrophils for destruction. This may be related to conditions such as: Crohn's disease Rheumatoid arthritis Lupus In some people, neutropenia can be caused by certain medications, such as: Certain antibiotics, like vancomycin, penicillin G, and oxacillin Drugs used to treat irregular heart rhythms, including quinidine and procainamide Antiviral drugs, like ganciclovir and valganciclovir Drugs used to treat overactive thyroid, such as methimazole and propylthiouracil Blood pressure medications Some psychiatric drugs, such as clozapine and chlorpromazine Epilepsy drugs (rare) Some anti-inflammatory medications for conditions like ulcerative colitis or rheumatoid arthritis, including sulfasalazine Neutropenia Diagnosis Neutropenia can be diagnosed with a simple blood test called a complete blood count with differential. If you are treated with chemotherapy, your doctor will likely monitor your neutrophil levels with regular blood work. If the cause of your neutropenia is unknown, your doctor may want to order additional tests, such as a bone marrow biopsy, to find out if your body is making neutrophils normally. Neutropenia Treatment When deciding on treatment, doctors consider the cause and severity of neutropenia. Mild cases may not need any treatment. Approaches for treating neutropenia can include: Antibiotics for fever. In neutropenic fever, the assumption is made that there is an infection causing the fever even when the source can't be found. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. This treatment stimulates the bone marrow to produce more white blood cells. It is used for several types of neutropenia, including low white cell count from chemotherapy . This treatment can be lifesaving in these cases. Changing medications. Updating the medications you're taking may be recommended in cases of neutropenia caused by taking certain drugs. Granulocyte (white blood cell) transfusion. This treatment is often used in people who've had chemotherapy or bone marrow transplants. Corticosteroids. These medications may be recommended if you have an autoimmune condition to help reduce your body's immune response and stop it from attacking the neutrophils. Stem cell transplants. These may be useful in treating some types of severe neutropenia, including those caused by bone marrow problems. Neutropenia Prevention People with neutropenia often need to take special steps to prevent infections. Some precautions to prevent neutropenia-related infections include: Good hygiene, including frequent handwashing and good dental care , such as regular tooth brushing and flossing Staying up to date on vaccinations Avoiding contact with sick people Always wearing shoes Cleaning cuts and scrapes and then covering them with a bandage Avoiding or properly caring for tattoos and piercings Using an electric shaver rather than a razor Avoiding animal waste and, when possible, not changing infants' diapers Avoiding unpasteurized dairy foods, undercooked meat, and raw fruits, vegetables, grains, nuts, and honey Staying out of hot tubs, ponds, and rivers Avoiding sharing razors, toothbrushes, and towels with others Avoiding eating or drinking from other people's utensils or cups Takeaways Neutropenia affects your body's ability to fight infections. If you're diagnosed with neutropenia, it's important to see your doctor to discuss a treatment plan. This may include regularly monitoring your neutrophil levels or taking medications to prevent infections. Neutropenia FAQs What is the primary cause of neutropenia? Neutropenia is common in people who are receiving cancer treatments like chemotherapy but can also be caused by infections, autoimmune conditions, lack of certain nutrients in your diet, or medications you're taking. It can also be inherited. What does it mean if you have neutropenia? If you have neutropenia, you have a low number of neutrophils, which is a type of white blood cell. How do you fix neutropenia? Some forms of neutropenia may not require treatment, like forms that people can be born with or that don't raise infection risks. Other treatment plans depend on the cause of neutropenia and may include corticosteroids, antibiotics, and other medications."
60,Cytomegalovirus (CMV),"What Is Cytomegalovirus? Cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) is a common virus. Over half of adults in the U.S. have it in their body by age 40. CMV spreads easily through an infected person’s saliva or other body fluids. It’s related to the herpes virus, which gives you cold sores . If you have a healthy immune system that can easily control the virus, it usually doesn't cause problems. But it can make people who have weakened immune systems sick. In people who have advanced HIV , CMV can cause an eye infection called retinitis that may lead to blindness. CMV retinitis is what’s known as an AIDS-defining condition. The virus could also affect your intestines , esophagus , lungs , brain , or nerves. There are different types of cytomegalovirus infection. Congenital. This is when a baby gets CMV from its mother before birth. Primary. This is the first time someone gets CMV. It usually doesn’t cause symptoms, but some people may have signs that look like mononucleosis . Reactivation. An infection that has been dormant can become active again when your immune system is weakened. It can happen if you have advanced HIV, are in treatment for cancer , or have an organ transplant . Cytomegalovirus Symptoms General symptoms of primary CMV Most healthy people who get CMV don't know it. If you have symptoms of primary CMV, they're mild and include: Fatigue Swollen glands Fever Sore throat Muscle aches Less common symptoms of primary CMV In rare cases, CMV can also cause: Changes to your personality Headaches Trouble concentrating Shortness of breath Dry cough Symptoms of congenital CMV Babies born with CMV might have: Premature delivery Small size or low birth weight Bruise-like rashes Yellow skin or eyes ( jaundice ) Swollen liver and spleen Small head ( microcephaly ) Seizures Hearing loss Pneumonia Liver inflammation (hepatitis) Symptoms of CMV with HIV If you also have advanced HIV, CMV can affect different parts of your body. You could have: Blind spots or moving black spots ( floaters ) in your eyesight Blurry vision Blindness Diarrhea Belly pain Trouble swallowing or painful swallowing because of ulcers in your mouth or esophagus Confusion Lower back pain Weight loss Fatigue Weakness in your legs If you have HIV, you probably won’t get sick with CMV unless your CD4 count, a type of white blood cell, is below 100. Cytomegalovirus Causes and Transmission You probably won't catch CMV from casual contact. But you can get it by touching your eyes , nose, or mouth after having contact with an infected person's: Saliva Semen Vaginal fluids Blood Urine Breast milk You can also get cytomegalovirus through: Sexual contact Blood transfusions Organ transplants CMV spreads easily in places with lots of young children, like day-care centers, so anyone who spends time there is at higher risk of getting it. You’re also more likely to get the virus if your immune system is weakened because of a medication or another health condition. Cytomegalovirus Tests and Diagnosis Your doctor will order tests such as: Blood and urine tests. These include CMV antigen (a part of the virus), a virus culture, or PCR (a molecular test). Serologic tests look for things your immune system makes to fight CMV, called IgM and IgG antibodies, although most healthy people also have them. A biopsy. Your doctor takes a small sample of tissue from your intestines , your esophagus, or your lung and look at it under a microscope. Eye tests to check for inflammation in your retina. Imaging tests , like a CT scan , to look for changes in your lungs or brain. Cytomegalovirus Treatment When you have retinitis because of CMV, your doctor may give you strong medications intravenously (through a vein) for a couple of weeks, a process called induction therapy. After a while, they may switch you to pills. You might have medication injected into your eye if your vision is in danger. Your doctor might prescribe drugs including: Cidofovir ( Vistide ) Foscarnet ( Foscavir ) Ganciclovir ( Cytovene ) Maribavir (Livtencity) Valganciclovir ( Valcyte ) These drugs generally can't cure the disease if you have advanced HIV, but they can control it while you get antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) for your HIV infection. Depending on the medicine, you could have side effects including: Low white blood cell count ( neutropenia ), which raises your chance for other infections Feeling tired from low red blood cell count ( anemia ) Upset stomach or throwing up Rash Kidney problems Most important, if you take ART early in an HIV infection, the drugs will keep it from getting worse and will keep you from getting CMV in the first place. Cytomegalovirus Complications It’s rare, but CMV can cause complications including: Mononucleosis Guillain -Barre syndrome Brain inflammation ( encephalitis ) Heart inflammation ( myocarditis ) In people with HIV, complications include: Retinitis Pneumonia Skin rashes and lesions Problems in the nerves, esophagus, lungs, colon , or mucous membranes Brain swelling Complications in babies born with CMV include: Learning problems Cerebral palsy or trouble with muscle tone and coordination Seizures Cytomegalovirus Outlook There’s no cure for CMV. The virus stays inactive in your body and can cause more problems later. This reactivation is most common in people who’ve had stem cell and organ transplants. Your outlook depends on your overall health. In people who have strong immune systems, CMV symptoms almost always go away on their own. Congenital CMV can have lifelong effects. The risks are highest when the mother has their first CMV infection during a pregnancy. If you have a weakened immune system, you might need treatment for the rest of your life to prevent complications. Cytomegalovirus Prevention CMV was once the most common viral opportunistic infection -- illnesses that are worse or happen more often in people with weakened immune systems -- tied to HIV. Now, ART can help keep your CD4 count up and your immune system strong. It can also help stop retinitis from coming back. If you have advanced HIV, your doctor might also give you medicine to prevent CMV, in addition to your ART. But it's expensive, sometimes causes severe side effects, and may not work well. The most important thing is to take your ART medications daily as prescribed. Talk to your doctor about your chance of getting CMV if you're having a blood transfusion ."
61,Give Your Body a Boost -- With Laughter,"Feeling rundown? Try laughing more. Some researchers think laughter just might be the best medicine, helping you feel better and putting that spring back in your step. ""I believe that if people can get more laughter in their lives, they are a lot better off,"" says Steve Wilson, MA, CSP, a psychologist and laugh therapist. ""They might be healthier too."" Yet researchers aren't sure if it's actually the act of laughing that makes people feel better. A good sense of humor, a positive attitude, and the support of friends and family might play a role, too. ""The definitive research into the potential health benefits of laughter just hasn't been done yet,"" says Robert R. Provine, professor of psychology and neuroscience at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County and author of Laughter: A Scientific Investigation . But while we don't know for sure that laughter helps people feel better, it certainly isn't hurting. Laughter Therapy: What Happens When We Laugh? We change physiologically when we laugh. We stretch muscles throughout our face and body, our pulse and blood pressure go up, and we breathe faster, sending more oxygen to our tissues. People who believe in the benefits of laughter say it can be like a mild workout -- and may offer some of the same advantages as a workout. ""The effects of laughter and exercise are very similar,"" says Wilson. ""Combining laughter and movement, like waving your arms, is a great way to boost your heart rate."" One pioneer in laughter research, William Fry, claimed it took ten minutes on a rowing machine for his heart rate to reach the level it would after just one minute of hearty laughter. And laughter appears to burn calories, too. Maciej Buchowski, a researcher from Vanderbilt University, conducted a small study in which he measured the amount of calories expended in laughing. It turned out that 10-15 minutes of laughter burned 50 calories. While the results are intriguing, don't be too hasty in ditching that treadmill. One piece of chocolate has about 50 calories; at the rate of 50 calories per hour, losing one pound would require about 12 hours of concentrated laughter! Laughter's Effects on the Body In the last few decades, researchers have studied laughter's effects on the body and turned up some potentially interesting information on how it affects us: Blood flow . Researchers at the University of Maryland studied the effects on blood vessels when people were shown either comedies or dramas. After the screening, the blood vessels of the group who watched the comedy behaved normally -- expanding and contracting easily. But the blood vessels in people who watched the drama tended to tense up, restricting blood flow. Immune response . Increased stress is associated with decreased immune system response, says Provine. Some studies have shown that the ability to use humor may raise the level of infection-fighting antibodies in the body and boost the levels of immune cells, as well. Blood sugar levels . One study of 19 people with diabetes looked at the effects of laughter on blood sugar levels . After eating, the group attended a tedious lecture. On the next day, the group ate the same meal and then watched a comedy. After the comedy, the group had lower blood sugar levels than they did after the lecture. Relaxation and sleep . The focus on the benefits of laughter really began with Norman Cousin's memoir, Anatomy of an Illness . Cousins, who was diagnosed with ankylosing spondylitis , a painful spine condition, found that a diet of comedies, like Marx Brothers films and episodes of Candid Camera, helped him feel better. He said that ten minutes of laughter allowed him two hours of pain-free sleep . The Evidence: Is Laughter the Best Medicine? But things get murky when researchers try to sort out the full effects of laughter on our minds and bodies. Is laughter really good for you? Can it actually boost your energy? Not everyone is convinced. ""I don't mean to sound like a curmudgeon,"" says Provine, ""but the evidence that laughter has health benefits is iffy at best."" He says that most studies of laughter have been small and not well conducted. He also says too many researchers have an obvious bias: they go into the study wanting to prove that laughter has benefits. For instance, Provine says studies of laughing have often not looked at the effects of other, similar activities. ""It's not really clear that the effects of laughing are distinct from screaming,"" Provine says. Provine says that the most convincing health benefit he's seen from laughter is its ability to dull pain. Numerous studies of people in pain or discomfort have found that when they laugh they report that their pain doesn't bother them as much. But Provine believes it's not clear that comedy is necessarily better than another distraction. ""It could be that a compelling drama would have the same effect."" One of the biggest problems with laughter research is that it's very difficult to determine cause and effect. For instance, a study might show that people who laugh more are less likely to be sick. But that might be because people who are healthy have more to laugh about. Or researchers might find that, among a group of people with the same disease, people who laugh more have more energy. But that could be because the people who laugh more have a personality that allows them to cope better. So it becomes very hard to say if laughter is actually an agent of change, or just a sign of a person's underlying condition. Laughing It Up for Quality of Life Laughter, Provine believes, is part of a larger picture. ""Laughter is social, so any health benefits might really come from being close with friends and family, and not the laughter itself."" In his own research, Provine has found that we're thirty times more likely to laugh when we're with other people than when we're alone. People who laugh a lot may just have a strong connection to the people around them. That in itself might have health benefits. Wilson agrees there are limits to what we know about laughter's benefits. ""Laughing more could make you healthier, but we don't know,"" he tells WebMD. ""I certainly wouldn't want people to start laughing more just to avoid dying -- because sooner or later, they'll be disappointed."" But we all know that laughing, being with friends and family, and being happy can make us feel better and give us a boost -- even though studies may not show why. So Wilson and Provine agree that regardless of whether laughter actually improves your health or boosts your energy, it undeniably improves your quality of life. ""Obviously, I'm not antilaughter,"" says Provine. ""I'm just saying that if we enjoy laughing, isn't that reason enough to laugh? Do you really need a prescription?"""
62,Hunter Syndrome (MPS II),"What Is Hunter Syndrome (MPS II)? Hunter syndrome , also called mucopolysaccharidosis II or MPS II, is a rare disease that's passed on in families. It mainly affects boys. Their bodies can't break down a kind of sugar that builds bones, skin , tendons, and other tissue. Those sugars build up in their cells and damage many parts of the body, including the brain . Exactly what happens is different for every person. When your son has Hunter syndrome, there are things you can do to help them play, have friends, and do some of the things that other kids do, even though they may look different from their pals. Although there is no cure for Hunter syndrome, there are ways to help manage it and live with the symptoms. Causes Boys with the disease can't make a certain protein because there's a problem with a small piece of their DNA, called a gene, that comes from their mother. A dad with Hunter syndrome will pass the problem gene to their daughter, but the daughter won't get the disease unless they get the gene from their mom, too. It's possible -- but very, very unlikely -- that someone could develop Hunter syndrome even though no one in their family going back has had it. Symptoms When Hunter syndrome affects the brain , which is about 75% of the time, symptoms usually show up between 18 months and 4 years of age. They start about 2 years later when the disease is milder. Hunter syndrome usually affects how the boy looks: Large, round cheeks Broad nose Thick lips and a large tongue Bushy eyebrows Large head Slowed growth Thick, tough skin Short, broad hands with stiff, curled fingers They'll probably have these symptoms: Joint problems that make it hard to move Numbness, weakness, and tingling in their hands A lot of coughs , colds, and sinus and throat infections Breathing problems , including pauses in breathing at night, or sleep apnea Hearing loss and ear infections Trouble walking and weak muscles Bowel problems, such as diarrhea Heart problems, including damaged heart valves Enlarged liver and spleen Bone thickening When a boy's brain is affected, it's likely they'll have: Trouble thinking and learning by the time they are 2 to 4 years old Trouble talking Behavior problems such as a hard time sitting still or aggression Kids who have Hunter syndrome are usually cheerful and affectionate, despite the problems it can cause. Getting a Diagnosis Doctors often have to rule out other medical conditions first. Your doctor may ask: What symptoms have you noticed? When did you first see them? Do they come and go? Does anything make them better? Or worse? Has anyone in your family had Hunter syndrome or another genetic disease? If the doctors can't find another explanation for your son's symptoms, they'll test for Hunter syndrome by checking for: High levels of that certain sugar in their urine How active the ""missing"" protein is in their blood or skin cells The abnormal gene After doctors are sure it's Hunter syndrome, it's a good idea to let extended family members know about the gene problem, too. If you're a pregnant woman and you know you carry the gene or you already have a child with Hunter syndrome, you can find out whether the baby you're carrying is affected. Talk to your doctor about testing early in your pregnancy. Questions for Your Doctor Will their symptoms change over time? If so, how? What treatments are best for them now? Is there a clinical trial that could help? Do these treatments have side effects? What can I do about them? How do we check their progress? Are there new symptoms I should watch for? How often do we need to see you? Are there other specialists we should see? If I have more children, are they likely to have this disease? Treatment Early treatment may prevent some long-term damage. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) can help slow the disease for boys with milder Hunter syndrome. It replaces the protein their body doesn't make. ERT can help improve: Walking, climbing stairs, and the ability to keep up in general Movement and stiff joints Breathing Growth Hair and facial features ERT is the first treatment for kids whose brains aren't affected. It doesn't slow the disease in the brain . Bone marrow and umbilical cord blood transplants . These transplants bring cells into your child's body that can hopefully make the protein they're missing. The new cells come from either a bone marrow donor whose cells match your child's or the stem cells of umbilical cord blood from newborn babies. Both of these treatments are high-risk. They're usually used only if other treatments aren't possible. They also haven't been shown to help when the brain is affected. Research is under way to find effective treatments for boys with severe Hunter syndrome. Treating the symptoms. Because so many different parts of your child's body can be affected, you'll probably need to see several doctors to help you manage the condition, including: Cardiologist: a heart specialist Ear, nose, and throat specialist Eye doctor Lung specialist Mental health professional Neurologist: works with the brain and nerves Speech therapist Medication or surgery can ease some of the complications. Physical therapy can help with joint and movement issues. And occupational therapy can help you make changes at home and school to make it easier to get around and do things. Medications like melatonin may help with sleep. Taking Care of Your Son Focus on keeping your son healthy and giving them the chance to live a meaningful, rewarding life. Include them in family activities whenever it's safe. Set the tone for others . Be positive. Keep an open mind about other people; they may not know what to say so they don't pry or offend or embarrass you. When someone asks about them, be matter-of-fact about their condition. Talk about them as a person -- their interests, their curiosity, and their sunny personality, too. Let them know what their needs as well as their abilities are, and how they can help, if that's appropriate. Activity . Start stretching and range-of-motion exercises early to keep their joints flexible. Ask your physical therapist about ways to make exercises part of play. Choose large toys that are easy to grab and hold on to, that won't be damaged by chewing. Encourage friendships . Talk to other kids (or their parents) about how to interact with your son. Walk up to them from the front, with hands out. Give them about an arm's length of space. It's OK to remind them to touch nice and not hit. But kids will be kids, so prepare them for stares and teasing with role-play and humor. Extra help for learning . Help them learn as much as they can while their brain is working well. If they go to school, work with the staff to come up with an individualized education program (IEP) for them. They may be eligible for one-on-one attention in the classroom or help for other issues, like hearing problems. Take care of yourself, too . You'll do a better job caring for your child when you have people you can turn to to help out with caregiving tasks. Step back, and take a break to rest and recharge. Spend time nurturing your relationship with yourself and others you love. Remember, the whole family is affected by this disease. A counselor can help sort out feelings. What to Expect Some boys with less severe Hunter syndrome grow up and live long lives. They'll go through puberty like other teens and can have children. But heart disease and trouble breathing can still cause problems for them. Kids with severe Hunter syndrome are less likely to reach adulthood. Their brains will slowly stop working, and eventually they'll need special care to make them comfortable. Parents of other Hunter syndrome boys are a great resource for understanding what's going on, sharing your feelings, and getting ideas for how to live with the condition. You can find ways to enjoy the time that you have with your child. Getting Support The National MPS Society has more information about this disease. They can also help you connect with other families who are facing the same challenges.

63,Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I),"What Is MPS I? MPS I stands for mucopolysaccharidosis type I. It starts in childhood. You can't ""catch"" it -- it comes from your genes. People with MPS I can't make a specific protein called alpha-L iduronidase, which is needed to break down sugars. These sugars build up in cells and cause damage throughout the body. People who have this disease can have problems with how their bodies grow and work, as well as trouble with thinking and learning. They might look different, too. Many people with milder MPS I can go to school and eventually work and have families. And even for people with more severe MPS I, there are treatments to help ease their symptoms and slow down the disease. Because it affects people in so many different ways, doctors used to separate MPS I into groups: Hurler, Hurler-Scheie, and Scheie syndromes. Now they talk about a range between two forms: Severe Attenuated, or less severe Causes MPS I is passed down through families. But you get it only when both parents give you a broken gene. If you get one normal gene and one ""bad"" gene, you won't have symptoms of MPS I. You could pass the gene to your children, though. Symptoms Many babies with MPS I don't show any signs of the disease at first. For those with less severe MPS I, symptoms show up later in childhood. People with this form, attenuated MPS I, probably can make a tiny bit of the protein, which is why their symptoms are milder and the disease moves very slowly. Children who have the severe form usually start to have symptoms while they're still infants. They're often big when they're born and grow quickly for a year, but then stop by the time they're 3. They might never grow taller than 4 feet. They also tend to look similar: Shorter than average, with stocky build Large head, bulging forehead Thick lips, widely spaced teeth, and large tongue Short, flat nose with wide nostrils Thick, tough skin Short, broad hands with curving fingers Knock-knees and walking on toes Curved spine MPS I can show up in a lot of different ways: Eye problems , including cloudy eyes and a hard time seeing in bright light or at night Bad breath , dental problems Weak neck Breathing problems and airway infections, including runny nose, sinus infections, and sleep apnea Ear infections and hearing loss Numbness and tingling in fingers or feet Heart disease Stiff joints and trouble moving Hernias, which look like a bulge around the belly button or in the groin Diarrhea Enlarged liver or spleen Your child might not have all of those symptoms. People with the milder form of the disease usually don't have as many physical problems. They typically have a normal intelligence and can do many things other people do. The more severe the disease, the more of these problems your child is likely to have. Severe MPS I can also affect intelligence and learning. Some kids might lose their ability to speak. Getting a Diagnosis Because it's a rare disease, doctors rule out other medical conditions first. Your doctor might ask: What symptoms have you noticed? When did you first see them? Do they come and go? Does anything make them better? Or worse? Has anyone in your family had similar symptoms in the past? If the doctors can't find another explanation for your child's symptoms, they'll test for MPS I by checking for: A lot of a specific sugar in their urine How active the ""missing"" protein is in their blood or skin cells After doctors are sure it's MPS I, it's a good idea to let your extended family know about the gene problem, too. If you are pregnant, know you are a carrier of the gene, and already have a child with MPS I, you can find out whether the baby you're carrrying is affected. Talk to your doctor about testing. Questions for Your Doctor Will my child's symptoms change over time? If so, how? What treatments are best for them now? Do these treatments have side effects? What can I do about them? Is there a clinical trial that could help? How do we check their progress? Are there new symptoms I should watch for? How often do we need to see you? Are there other specialists we should see? If I have more children, how likely are they to have MPS I? Treatment Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) uses a drug called laronidase (Aldurazyme), a man-made version of the missing protein. It has changed the outlook for many kids with MPS I. It can relieve most symptoms and slow the progress of the disease, although it doesn't help treat symptoms from the brain, like problems with thinking or learning. Another option may be a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), in which doctors put new cells into your child's body that might make the protein their body is missing. These cells often come from bone marrow or umbilical cord blood. When children get a transplant before they're 2 years old, they might be able to learn better. But HSCT can't fix bone or eye problems. Work with a doctor who specializes in lysosomal storage diseases, or LSDs. Depending on what symptoms your child has, you might need to see other specialists, too. Often they'll include a cardiologist, who focuses on the heart , and an eye doctor. Taking Care of Your Child Encourage your child to be independent and make friends. Kids with MPS I are often well-liked and enjoy being with others. Include them in safe family activities. Most important, be positive. Keep an open mind about other people's reactions when you introduce your child to them. They might not know what to say, possibly because they don't want to pry or offend or embarrass you. When people ask about your child, tell them about their condition and what they can and can't do. Also mention your child's interests, their curiosity, and their personality. Talk to the staff at your child's school to come up with an individualized education program (IEP). Your child might need one-on-one attention in the classroom, a special desk, or other adjustments. To protect their necks, kids with MPS I should avoid contact sports, gymnastics, trampolines, and similar activities. Look for ways to change how your home is set up to make it easier for your child to move around and do things on their own. Make time for yourself and your family, too. It's OK to have someone take over caregiving duties for a while. Step back and take a break to rest and recharge. What to Expect Although there is no cure for MPS I, treatments can improve the quality of life -- especially when started early. They slow the disease and help stop damage before it starts. Most kids who have less severe MPS I can go to school with other children. They'll go through puberty and can have kids of their own. Adults are protected by the Americans with Disabilities Act, so they might be able to work and live on their own. When the disease is more severe, it moves faster. Children with the most severe form usually get worse very quickly, and they might not live to be teenagers. Special care focuses on easing pain and offering support, so your child and your family can have the best quality of life. Getting Support To learn more about MPS I, visit the National MPS Society website . You can also find ways to connect with other people living with the disease."
64,Progeria,"What Is Progeria? Progeria is also known as Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) or the “Benjamin Button” disease (named after the short story and movie ‘The Curious Case of Benjamin Button’). It’s  a rare genetic condition that results in  a child's body aging rapidly. A mutation in the LMNA gene causes progeria. Most kids with progeria don’t live past age 13. The disease affects people of all sexes and races equally. About 1 in every 4 million babies are born with it worldwide. A single mistake in a certain gene causes it to make an abnormal protein. When cells use this protein, called progerin, they break down more easily. This leads kids with progeria to age quickly. Progeria Symptoms There are usually no symptoms when a baby is born, but they start to show signs of the disease during their first year. They develop physical traits including: Slow height and weight growth A bigger head Large eyes , which they can’t close all the way A small lower jaw A thin nose with a ""beaked"" tip Ears that stick out Veins you can see Slow and abnormal tooth growth A high-pitched voice Loss of body fat and muscle Hair loss , including eyelashes and eyebrows Thin, wrinkled skin that shows spots As children with progeria get older, they get diseases you'd expect to see in people age 50 and older, including bone loss , hardening of the arteries , and heart disease . Children with progeria usually die of heart attacks or strokes. Progeria doesn't affect a child's intelligence or brain development. A child with the condition isn't any more likely to get infections than other kids, either. Progeria Causes and Risk Factors A mutation in the lamin A (LMNA) gene causes progeria. The gene makes a protein that holds together the center of a cell. With progeria, the body makes an abnormal form of lamin A called progerin, which leads to rapid aging. Researchers haven’t found any risk factors for progeria. It isn’t inherited or passed down in families. Progeria Diagnosis The symptoms are  noticeable. It's likely that a pediatrician will spot them during a routine checkup. If you see changes in your child that seem like symptoms of progeria, make an appointment with your pediatrician or family doctor. Your doctor will do a physical exam , test hearing and vision , measure pulse and blood pressure , and compare your child's height and weight to other kids the same age. If your pediatrician is concerned, you may need to see a specialist in medical genetics who can confirm the diagnosis with a blood test. Before the genetic blood tests were availables, doctors could only diagnose progeria with X-rays and observation. Progeria Treatments There's no cure for progeria, but researchers are working on finding one. One clinical trial is looking at a kind of cancer drug, FTIs (farnesyltransferase inhibitors), to see if it can help slow the disease. Treatments can help ease or delay some of the disease's symptoms. Medication and diet changes. Your child's doctor may suggest drugs and changes to your child’s diet to lower cholesterol or prevent blood clots . A low dose of aspirin every day can help prevent heart attacks and stroke . Growth hormone can help build height and weight. The FDA has approved lonafarnib ( Zokinvy ) to prevent the buildup of defective progerin, which can affect the heart. Physical and occupational therapy can help your child keep moving if they have stiff joints or hip problems. Surgery. Some children may have coronary bypass surgery or angioplasty to slow the progression of heart disease . At home. Kids with progeria are more likely to get dehydrated, so they need to drink plenty of water, especially when they're sick or it's hot. Small meals more often can help them eat enough, too. Cushioned shoes or inserts can ease discomfort and encourage your child to play and stay active. Sunscreen. Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 15. Reapply it every 2 hours, or more if your child is sweating or swimming. Progeria Complications Children with progeria usually develop a condition called atherosclerosis, which hardens and slows blood flow from blood vessels that carry nutrients and oxygen to your body. Most children with progeria die of heart attacks and strokes related to atherosclerosis. Similar Conditions Wiedemann-Rautenstrauch syndrome and Werner syndrome , which are similar to progeria, tend to be inherited. Both of these rare syndromes also cause rapid aging and a shortened life span."
65,What to Know About Molar Pregnancy,"What Is Molar Pregnancy? A molar pregnancy is a complication in which an abnormal mass or tumor forms inside your uterus, instead of a placenta. In a healthy pregnancy, the placenta is an organ that grows in the uterus and nourishes a developing baby through the umbilical cord. With a molar pregnancy, the embryo can't develop. This results in the loss of the pregnancy, usually through a miscarriage. Molar pregnancy is a type of gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD). These are rare conditions in which tumors grow in your uterus during early pregnancy. They stem from abnormal changes in the trophoblast, a layer of cells that surrounds an embryo shortly after conception. Your doctor might call a molar pregnancy a hydatidiform mole (HM). Types of Molar Pregnancy There are two types of molar pregnancy, partial and complete. Partial molar pregnancy In a partial molar pregnancy, both the placenta and embryo (fertilized egg) are abnormal. It usually happens after an egg is fertilized by two sperm. A fetus may develop, but it can't survive. This type is sometimes called an incomplete molar pregnancy. Complete molar pregnancy In a complete molar pregnancy, there’s an abnormal placenta, but no embryo. This happens after a sperm fertilizes an egg that doesn't contain any genetic material. This type is more common than the partial type. Molar Pregnancy Causes Molar pregnancies are caused by genetic problems that happen during conception. Scientists don't know exactly what causes them. Normal human cells contain 23 pairs of chromosomes, one set from each parent. These structures carry information that tells the body’s cells what to do. In a complete molar pregnancy, the egg doesn't contain any chromosomes, which results in the absence of half of the genetic material. In a partial molar pregnancy, there’s an extra set of chromosomes that comes from the father. When this happens, the fertilized egg can’t survive. It usually dies a few weeks into the pregnancy. Molar Pregnancy Risk Factors In the U.S., 1 out of every 1,000 pregnancies are molar pregnancies. Things that may increase your chances include: Being younger than 20 or older than 40 Having experienced a molar pregnancy in the past Having a history of pregnancy loss Difficulty conceiving or infertility problems Being of Asian descent Molar Pregnancy Symptoms Sometimes, molar pregnancy doesn't cause any symptoms. But they can include: Bleeding from your vagina in the first 3 months of pregnancy Watery brown discharge Sacs (they look like clusters of grapes) that pass out of your vagina Nausea and vomiting that happen more often or are worse than what’s normal during pregnancy Lots of pressure or pain in your pelvis More swelling in the belly area than expected for your stage of pregnancy Preeclampsia (high blood pressure) Anemia, in which your body has too few red blood cells Very high levels of the pregnancy hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) Cysts on your ovaries An overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism) Call your doctor if you notice any unusual symptoms during pregnancy. Molar Pregnancy Diagnosis You might find out you have a molar pregnancy during a routine ultrasound test. Your doctor could detect a problem through a blood test that shows your hCG levels are much higher than they should be. Or you might not know until you have a miscarriage. Molar pregnancy ultrasound An ultrasound is a device that uses sound waves to look inside your uterus. You might have a transvaginal ultrasound, in which your doctor places a wandlike device in your vagina to create the image. If you have a partial molar pregnancy, the ultrasound might show: Little amniotic fluid A fetus that's smaller than it should be A placenta that looks unusual With a complete molar pregnancy, your doctor might see No amniotic fluid No embryo A placenta that's very large and thick Cysts on your ovaries If your doctor finds you have a molar pregnancy, they may do further imaging tests, such as a CT scan or MRI, to see if the tumor has spread to other parts of your body. Molar Pregnancy Treatment Molar pregnancy treatments involve removing the placental tissue to prevent complications. Your doctor may use a procedure called dilation and curettage (D&C). This is often the treatment for pregnancy loss due to any reason. During this procedure, your doctor opens your cervix with special tools and removes the tissue from your uterus. Sometimes, doctors use medication for this purpose. It causes the uterus to contract and expel its contents. If you don’t want to get pregnant again, you may consider a total hysterectomy . That’s surgery to remove your uterus. If your blood type is Rh-negative, you'll get a shot of the drug Rh immunoglobulin as part of your treatment for molar pregnancy. This helps prevent complications. After the molar tissue is removed, your doctor may do blood tests several times over the next few months to see whether your hCG levels are getting back to normal. Molar Pregnancy Complications Persistent gestational trophoblastic neoplasia In rare cases, tissue remains after a molar pregnancy is removed or miscarried. The abnormal tissue may grow outside your uterus and into the layer of muscle below it. This condition is called persistent gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) . It's more likely with complete molar pregnancies. To treat persistent GTN, you may need to receive chemotherapy (“ chemo ”) or have a hysterectomy. Choriocarcinoma A molar pregnancy can also lead to a type of cancer called choriocarcinoma, which can spread to other areas of your body. This is rare but more likely to happen with a complete molar pregnancy than a partial one. Your doctor can treat choriocarcinoma with chemo or radiation. Other complications Some other complications are possible, including: Preeclampsia (high blood pressure) Shock (low blood pressure) Infection in your uterus Blood infection (sepsis) Does a molar pregnancy cause infertility? Molar pregnancy doesn't affect your fertility. But after a molar pregnancy, your doctor might recommend that you don’t conceive for up to a year. Pregnancy increases hCG levels, so it would be hard for them to know whether the rise in hormones is due to that, abnormal tissue that’s still in your body, or choriocarcinoma. Molar Pregnancy Prevention The only way to be certain you won’t have a molar pregnancy is not to get pregnant . If you’ve had a molar pregnancy in the past, talk to your doctor. Ask them about the chances of it happening again. And find out how you’ll be monitored if you do get pregnant . Takeaways Molar pregnancy is when an abnormal clump of cells develops in your uterus, rather than a placenta. This means the embryo can't develop. Molar pregnancy often ends in miscarriage. But if that doesn't happen, it requires treatment to avoid complications. Molar Pregnancy FAQs How serious is a molar pregnancy? If you miscarry a molar pregnancy or have been successfully treated for one, you're not likely to have serious issues. Rarely, you could develop serious complications, including a type of cancer called choriocarcinoma. But the complications can often be successfully treated. Can you still have a baby with a molar pregnancy? A molar pregnancy cannot develop into a baby. But having a molar pregnancy doesn't prevent you from conceiving and having a healthy pregnancy in the future. How long can you carry a molar pregnancy? If you have a partial molar pregnancy, the embryo can generally survive no longer than 3 months. If you don't have a miscarriage, your doctor will need to do a procedure or give you medication to remove it from your body. Prompt treatment is important to avoid complications."
66,Hydrocele,"What Is a Hydrocele? A hydrocele is a swelling in the scrotum, the thin sac that holds the testicles. It happens when too much fluid builds up inside. The condition is most common in newborns, though it can happen to anyone with a scrotum. It may sound or look serious, even painful, but it won’t hurt your baby . It might go away on its own, though you should still see the doctor about it. Hydrocele Causes A hydrocele can start before your baby is born. The testicles grow inside their belly and then move down into their scrotum through a short tunnel. A sac of fluid goes with each testicle. Usually, the tunnel and the sac seal off before birth, and the baby ’s body absorbs the fluid inside. When this process doesn’t go as it should, they can get a hydrocele. There are two types of hydrocele: A noncommunicating hydrocele happens when the sac closes like normal, but the boy’s body doesn’t absorb the fluid inside it. A communicating hydrocele happens when the sac doesn’t seal. With this type, their scrotum may swell more over time. Babies born prematurely are more likely to have a hydrocele. Hydrocele Symptoms A hydrocele doesn’t hurt. The only symptom you’ll notice is that one or both of the baby’s testicles look swollen. Even if they are not in pain , you should see the pediatrician to make sure they don’t have other health problems that are causing the swelling, such as an infection, a tumor, or a hernia . The swelling from a noncommunicating hydrocele doesn’t have changes in size. A communicating hydrocele can get bigger during the day, and if you gently squeeze it, the fluid will move out of the scrotum and into their belly. Hydrocele Diagnosis When you take your baby to the doctor, they’ll do a physical exam . They’ll check the scrotum for fluid and tenderness, and shine a light through it to see if there’s fluid around their testicle. Your doctor will also check to make sure your baby doesn’t have a hernia. Your baby may also have a blood test and an ultrasound to make sure nothing else is causing the swelling. Hydrocele Treatment A hydrocele usually goes away on its own before a boy’s first birthday. If it doesn’t, or if it gets bigger, their doctor will refer them to a specialist called a urologist. If your son has a communicating hydrocele, the pediatrician will usually recommend surgery without waiting for it to go away. The doctor can remove a hydrocele in a brief operation called a hydrocelectomy. Your baby will get a local numbing agent or be put to sleep under anesthesia.Then, a surgeon makes a cut in their scrotum or lower belly. The surgeon then drains the fluid and sews the sac closed. Once it’s finished, your son can go home the same day. In the days after surgery, you’ll need to keep the area clean and dry. The doctor and team will show you how to care for your baby as they heal. After a few days, you may need to take them back to the doctor to make sure they are healing well. Hydrocele Complications Most of the time, a hydrocele isn't very serious and doesn’t usually affect fertility later on in life. But sometimes, the presence of a hydrocele might mean there’s a more serious problem with the testes and potential complications. These include: Infection or tumor. These could reduce sperm production or function. Trauma Inguinal hernia. This happens when a loop of intestine sticks out through a weak spot in the abdominal wall, and gets trapped. This can cause dangerous complications."
67,Hydrocephalus,"What Is Hydrocephalus? Hydrocephalus -- which roughly means “water on the brain” -- is the buildup of fluid in the cavities (ventricles) deep within the brain. This fluid doesn’t flow or get absorbed the way it should. That can lead to backups and blockages that put pressure on your brain . You’ve probably heard that the human body is mostly water . That’s true. From your blood to the fluids that flow in and around your tissues and organs, liquid makes up about 70% of your body. Your head is no different. Your skull is filled with a fluid that surrounds your brain’s folds and lobes. It’s called cerebrospinal fluid, and it cushions your brain from injuries and has nutrients and proteins that help keep it healthy and working. Cerebrospinal fluid also: Allows the relatively heavy brain to float within the skull Removes waste products of the brain’s metabolism Flows back and forth between the brain cavity and spinal column to regulate pressure in the brain Hydrocephalus happens most often in infants or in adults older than 60, but you can have it at any age. It can’t be cured, but with early diagnosis and treatment, people can live active lives. Hydrocephalus Symptoms Symptoms of hydrocephalus can be different depending on your age. In babies, they include: An unusually large head that gets bigger quickly The soft spot on top of a baby’s head is firm or bulging Eyes that are focused downward (sometimes called “sunsetting of the eyes”) Crankiness or irritability Vomiting or poor feeding Seizures Poor muscle tone and strength Less responsive to touch Poor growth Symptoms of hydrocephalus in toddlers and children: Headaches Eyes that are focused downward (sometimes called “sunsetting of the eyes” ) Blurry vision An unusually large head Sleepiness or low energy Nausea or vomiting Bad balance or coordination Problems with gait (walking) Lack of appetite Seizures Peeing often or loss of bladder control Crankiness or change in mood Change in personality Trouble doing well in school Delays or problems in already acquired skills, such as walking and talking Symptoms of hydrocephalus in adults younger than 60: Headaches Tiredness Poor balance or coordination Peeing often or loss of bladder control Changes in vision A drop-off in memory or concentration that causes problems at work Symptoms of hydrocephalus in adults older than 60: Peeing often or loss of bladder control Memory loss Trouble with planning or processing skills Problems walking or poor coordination Dementia General slowing of movements Hydrocephalus Causes The three main causes of hydrocephalus are: A blockage . Tumors, cysts, birth defects, brain injury, or stroke can block or affect the normal flow of cerebrospinal fluid. Poor fluid absorption . Inflammation, injuries, or infections like bacterial meningitis can keep your brain tissues from taking in cerebrospinal fluid. Too much fluid . In rare cases, your body makes more cerebrospinal fluid than your brain can handle, often due to  infection like meningitis. Types of Hydrocephalus The four main types of hydrocephalus are: Congenital hydrocephalus . This is when someone is born with hydrocephalus. Compensated hydrocephalus. This shows up early in life -- sometimes before birth -- but doesn’t cause symptoms until later in life. Acquired hydrocephalus. This is caused by a tumor, cyst, head injury, or a brain infection. Normal pressure hydrocephalus . This usually shows up in older adults and leads to a swelling in the small, open areas of the brain but without any change in pressure. Doctors aren’t sure what causes this type. Some experts refer to hydrocephalus as either “communicating” -- meaning the cerebrospinal fluid is flowing freely -- or “non-communicating,” which is when there’s a blockage. Hydrocephalus Diagnosis Your doctor will start with a physical examination and ask about your symptoms, then recommend tests to look for signs of hydrocephalus. Tests may include: Neurological exam to check muscle strength, reflexes, coordination, balance, vision, eye movement, hearing, mental functioning, and mood Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) , a scan that uses powerful magnets and radio waves to make detailed images of your brain Computerized tomography (CT) scan , a series of X-rays taken from different angles that are put together to make a more complete picture of your brain Spinal tap , when a doctor inserts a needle into the lower back in order to remove and test some of the fluid Intracranial pressure monitoring (ICP) , which uses a small monitor inserted into the brain to measure how much swelling is there; intracranial pressure can also be measured by EVD (external ventricular drain) or lumbar drain (like a lumbar puncture but a small catheter stays in place to measure pressure and to drain fluid). Fundoscopic exam , which looks at the nerve behind the eye to see if swelling is present Hydrocephalus Treatments If your symptoms are mild, you may not need treatment. If they’re serious, your doctor probably will recommend surgery to put a flexible plastic tube called a shunt in your brain to redirect the cerebrospinal fluid into another part of your body, like your belly. The shunt typically isn’t ever removed, and regular checkups are important to make sure it’s working. In some cases, hydrocephalus can be treated without using a shunt. One type of surgery, endoscopic third ventriculostomy, opens a pathway in your brain so the fluid can flow freely, while the other closes off the part of your brain that makes cerebrospinal fluid. If your hydrocephalus is due to a tumor, the tumor can be removed; if it is due to a stroke, the skull may be opened to relieve pressure and swelling. Some medications help slow the production of CSF, such as acetazolamide (Diamox). Many people with hydrocephalus find help through therapy and education. Specialists may provide: Occupational therapy to help children and adults with life skills Developmental therapy to help children learn social behaviors Special education for learning disabilities Mental health care or social workers to provide emotional support and help families find services Dementia care Hydrocephalus Complications It’s important to get medical help right away if anything goes wrong after treatment for hydrocephalus. Complications of shunt systems can happen when the shunt is blocked and stops working or when an infection occurs. This can cause cerebral spinal fluid to build up again. Signs and symptoms may include: Headache Double vision or sensitivity to light Nausea or vomiting Soreness of the neck or shoulder muscles Seizures Redness or tenderness along the shunt tract Low-grade fever Sleepiness or tiredness Return of hydrocephalus symptoms The most common complication of ETV surgery is when the pathway created by the surgery closes and it leads to infection. Signs of such  problem may include: Fever Bleeding Short-term memory loss Temporary problems with the endocrine system, which regulates hormones If any previous symptoms of hydrocephalus symptoms come back, it’s a sign of a complication. Other things to look for include: Trouble waking up or staying awake. Get urgent care for this symptom because it may lead to a coma. Swelling or redness along shunt tract Fever Prominent scalp veins in babies Hydrocephalus Prevention Some, but not all causes of hydrocephalus can be prevented. Safety gear such as helmets can help prevent head injuries while playing sports, riding a bike, and other activities. Car seats and seatbelts can help protect children in the car. Regular health care during pregnancy can help lower the chances of problems during pregnancy, including infection and premature birth. Meningitis was once a common cause of hydrocephalus. Ask your doctor about a vaccine. Hydrocephalus Outlook The long-term effects of hydrocephalus vary widely and depend on the cause and the extent of symptoms. Without treatment, hydrocephalus will get worse over time, but with surgery, therapy, and education, many people live relatively active lives. The earlier it's diagnosed, the better the chances for successful treatment and recovery."
68,What is Congenital Hydrocephalus?,"Hydrocephalus is a condition in which too much fluid builds up in the brain . The name comes from a combination from Greek words meaning “water” and “head.” “Congenital” means a person is born with it. The liquid that builds up isn’t water. It’s cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). It circulates through the brain , bringing important nutrients and flushing away waste products from tissues. Normally, it’s absorbed into the bloodstream. With hydrocephalus, there’s an imbalance between how fast fluid is made and how quickly it’s absorbed. The result is that it builds up. This can cause the head to enlarge and increase pressure around the brain . There are treatments to help, depending on the underlying cause. Causes In general, an imbalance can happen for any one of three reasons: The ventricles – spaces in the brain where CSF is made -- produce too much fluid. Something blocks the normal flow of fluid and causes it to build up. The bloodstream can’t absorb all the fluid. Congenital hydrocephalus can be genetic or caused by something else that occurred during pregnancy . Common reasons for congenital hydrocephalus include: Aqueductal stenosis , a type of blockage. The passageway between two of the ventricles in the brain is narrow or blocked, and fluid can’t circulate. The path may be cut off because of an infection, a tumor, or a hemorrhage. Neural tube defects. Among these is spina bifida , in which a baby is born with part of the spinal cord exposed. In some cases, the flow of CSF out of the skull may be blocked. Arachnoid cysts , a type of growth in the brain that can block the flow of fluid. Dandy-Walker syndrome , a condition in which parts of the brain don’t develop as they should. Among other issues, one ventricle of the brain becomes enlarged because the pathways out are very narrow or closed. Chiari malformations , conditions that affect the spot where the brain and spinal cord join. The lower part of the brain pushes down into the spinal column, causing a blockage. Diagnosis Routine ultrasound tests during pregnancy may be able to pick up problems with your baby’s brain development, such as enlarged ventricles or spaces within the brain. If a problem shows up on ultrasound, further tests can help diagnose the issue more clearly. Because some babies with hydrocephalus also have other serious health issues, your doctor will want to get a full picture of your baby’s overall condition. So you might get other tests, such as an MRI – which can provide more details on your baby’s brain development. Your doctor may also take a sample of your amniotic fluid , to check on your baby’s chromosomes. Your doctor will also want to know about your family’s health history, especially if any of your relatives have had any neural tube defects. Treatment Even though doctors can diagnose hydrocephaly in the womb, treatment generally doesn’t begin until your baby is born. The most common treatment for congenital hydrocephaly is a shunt system. A surgeon will place a flexible plastic tube in the baby’s brain to drain the extra fluid. The other end of the tube goes under the skin and into the belly, or another place in the body where the excess CSF can be absorbed. Another possible treatment is called ETV (endoscopic third ventriculostomy), which uses fiber-optic technology. A doctor guides a small camera into a baby’s brain and, with a tool, opens a hole in a ventricle, bypassing a blockage. The brain fluid then drains through that hole and is absorbed into the bloodstream. What to Expect The outlook for babies born with hydrocephalus varies and depends in part on the cause of the condition. Shunt systems have to be watched carefully. Your child might need more than one procedure. Among the problems that can crop up: Infections Clogged lines Mechanical problems Shunt needs to be longer ETV also has some risks. The opening in the ventricle could close suddenly, which can be life-threatening. Infection, fever and bleeding also could occur. Even when it’s treated, congenital hydrocephalus can affect physical and intellectual development. Your child may need rehabilitation and special education, but a normal life with just a few limitations is possible."
69,When Should I Use Heat or Ice for Pain?,"Heat boosts the flow of blood and nutrients to an area of the body. It often works best for morning stiffness or to warm up muscles before activity. Cold slows blood flow, reducing swelling and pain . It’s often best for short-term pain, like that from a sprain or a strain. But does it matter which one you use for an injury? This article will help you sort it out. When Either Heat Or Cold Will Do Soothe aches and pains caused by conditions like osteoarthritis , rheumatoid arthritis , back pain , fibromyalgia , and neck pain with either heat or cold. Each can give you relief from these symptoms: Muscle aches, spasms, and pains Lower and upper back pain Stiff, swollen, or tender joints Neck stiffness Finger, hand , or wrist pain Knee pain For short-term pain relief of any of these conditions, apply a hot or cold compress using any of these items: An electric heating pad A gel pack that can be microwaved or frozen A bag of ice or frozen vegetables A washcloth or small towel soaked in hot or cold water (wring it out, fold it, and apply to the sore area) Whether you use heat or cold, be sure to wrap the pack in a thin towel to help protect your skin . Apply to the painful area for 15-20 minutes several times each day. Whether you use heat or cold, you may notice your skin looks a little pinker after applying the compress. That’s normal, but let your skin return to its normal color and temperature before applying fresh ice or heat. Call your doctor if you notice any of the following signs after removing the compress. These symptoms mean the temperature was too extreme and may have caused skin damage: Skin that’s purplish-red, dark red, or a spotty red and white color Hives Swelling Blisters Hydrotherapy Showers and baths aren't just for mornings. When you're hurting, stand under or settle into warm water for a few minutes to help soothe and relax you. (If you're over 70 or have heart problems, check with your doctor before getting into a hot tub.) Try a warm shower or bath before you exercise to help loosen joints and muscles. Use cool water after exercise to help calm deep, burning pain and reduce inflammation . Or you can mix it up with a contrast bath to increase blood flow, reduce pain and swelling, and promote healing. Get two tubs or containers large enough for your painful area ready with warm and cold water. Soak in the warm tub for about 5 minutes and then plunge into the cold tub for about 1 minute. Go back to the warm for a few more minutes and then the cold for a minute. Repeat four or five times. Warm Clothes Want an easier -- and less painful -- start to your day? Warm your clothes in the dryer for a few minutes before you put them on. The heated garments may help ease morning pain and stiffness. Heat Wraps If heat helps ease your pain, try a continuous low-level heat wrap, available at drugstores. You can wear a heat wrap for up to 8 hours, even while you sleep. Follow the directions carefully. Studies suggest that low-level, long-term heat applied directly on the skin can significantly reduce stiffness and tension and increase flexibility. The effects can last for 48 hours or longer. Heated Wax Therapy Another way to apply heat -- especially to hands, elbows, and feet -- is warm, melted paraffin. You can buy paraffin wax kits at your local drugstore or beauty supply. A heated container safely melts the wax and mineral oil to make a paraffin bath. Dip your achy body part into the bath several times to build up a warm layer. Take it out of the bath, and cover it with plastic and wrap in a towel for 10-15 minutes until the wax cools. Unwrap and peel the wax away. To avoid irritation and pain, make sure the skin that you treat has no cuts or sores."
70,What Is PIK3CA-Related Overgrowth Spectrum (PROS)?,"Vascular malformations caused by PROS are present at birth, but they may not show up until later in life. (Photo credit: Dermnet NZ) PIK3CA-related overgrowth spectrum (PROS) isn’t just one thing. It’s called a spectrum because it’s a group of rare syndromes. What they have in common is that they involve body parts that grow too much or have an unusual shape. This happens because of changes, or mutations, in a gene called PIK3CA. Those changes and the overgrowth they cause can happen in many parts of the body, including the skin, blood vessels, bones, fat, and brain. PROS can have a variety of symptoms, depending on which type it is and which parts of the body are affected. Often, these symptoms are visible when a baby is born, so doctors can diagnose a child with a PROS condition at birth. Sometimes it happens later in childhood. Understanding PIK3CA and PROS PROS-related vascular malformations can affect veins, arteries, and lymph vessels anywhere in the body. (Photo credit: Science Source) Changes in the PIK3CA gene cause PROS because of the gene’s regular job in your body. Like many genes, it has instructions for making a certain protein. The PIK3CA protein controls other proteins that act as important signals in your body. Those signals help to make sure that cells grow, divide, move, and die when they should. When cells don’t have the right PIK3CA instructions, the protein doesn’t do its job the right way. Faulty PIK3CA leads to mistakes in cell growth. When those mistakes cause cells to grow and divide too fast or live too long, it leads to overgrowth or unusual shapes in the parts of the body where it happens. In people with PROS, unusual growth can happen in some parts of the body but not others. That’s because the mutations that cause PROS usually aren’t in all of your cells, just some of them. Unlike many other genetic conditions, PROS isn’t passed on from parent to child. So if your child has it, it doesn’t mean that you have it or that your other children will. Types of PROS Sometimes, doctors diagnose PROS itself. Other times, they might give a diagnosis of one of the syndromes that fall under PROS, such as: Fibroadipose hyperplasia. This type causes patchy growths on limbs or other body parts. It happens when fatty or fibrous tissue or blood vessels grow too much. The growths tend to get worse over time and can cause problems with walking and movement. CLOVES syndrome. This condition’s name is an acronym that describes its symptoms. C stands for congenital, meaning it’s there at birth. L is for lipomatous, or related to fat. (Most infants with CLOVES have a visible fatty mass.) O is for overgrowth. V is for vascular malformations, or unusual blood vessels, which can cause things like birthmarks or prominent veins. E is for epidermal nevus, a kind of skin lesion. S is for spinal or skeletal problems, including a curved spine, called scoliosis. People with CLOVES can have other signs too, such as large hands, feet, fingers, or toes and wide spaces between their toes and fingers. Megalencephaly-capillary malformation (MCAP) syndrome. This form of PROS causes overgrowth of the brain and other body parts, such as blood vessels and parts of the face. People with MCAP syndrome may have a developmental delay and unusual fingers and toes. Hemihyperplasia-multiple lipomatosis (HHML) syndrome. This type often affects the growth of arms and legs. HHML syndrome causes slow-growing and painless fatty masses under the skin in many parts of the body. These often happen on the back, torso, legs, arms, and fingers. There may also be unusual blood vessels. Hemimegalencephaly. In this type, all or half of the brain is bigger than usual. There may also be changes in blood vessels. Children with hemimegalencephaly may have seizures, paralysis, and developmental delays. Facial infiltrating lipomatosis. This disorder includes painless swelling or overgrowth of part of the face. It often happens on only one side of the head. Sometimes, masses grow from nerves, or part of the tongue is bigger than usual. Bones and teeth also may be affected. Treatment There’s no cure for PROS, but there are ways to manage the condition and its symptoms. Your child’s doctor may recommend surgery to remove overgrowths, especially if they’re causing trouble with movement or other activities. Surgery might also relieve pressure on the brain, correct scoliosis, or manage other problems. Medications can help with seizures or other symptoms. What’s Ahead for My Child? PROS is a lifelong condition. The overgrowth of tissues may affect your child’s daily life in a number of ways. Since PROS is so variable and can affect different parts of the body, the outlook and symptoms can vary a lot from one person to the next. For example, when the brain is affected, it can lead to developmental delays and learning differences. Some people with PROS also may be more likely to get cancer. (Changes in the PIK3CA gene also show up in tumors of people with cancer who don’t have PROS.) Ask your doctor about your child’s risk now and in the future."
71,What Are Urea Cycle Disorders?,"Urea cycle disorders (UCDs) are a group of diseases. They make it hard for your child’s body to remove waste products as they digest proteins. They are inherited diseases -- you pass them down to your child. In most cases, you can manage them with diet and medications . When your baby eats protein , their body breaks it down into amino acids and uses what they need. What they don’t need is further broken down into waste products that their body removes. This happens in a process called the urea cycle. Your baby’s liver makes things called enzymes that turn waste nitrogen into urea. The urea leaves their body in their urine . If your child has a urea cycle disorder, their liver can’t make one of the enzymes the cycle needs. When their body can’t remove nitrogen, ammonia forms and collects in their blood . It’s toxic and can cause brain damage or put them in a coma . It can even be fatal if you don’t treat it quickly. Who Gets Them? UCDs affect about 1 in 35,000 newborns. There are eight types. They’re named after what’s missing from the urea cycle. You’ll also hear doctors call them by their initials: ARG1 deficiency -- Arginase ASL deficiency -- Argininosuccinate lyase ASS1 deficiency -- Argininosuccinate synthase 1 Citrin deficiency -- Citrin CPSI deficiency -- Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I NAGS deficiency -- N-acetylglutamate synthase ORNT1 deficiency -- Ornithine translocase OTC deficiency -- Ornithine transcarbamylase Parents pass these diseases down to their children through defective genes. We all inherit two copies of our genes, one from each parent. With most UCDs, you must get a defective gene from both parents to get the disease. The genes tell your child’s body how to break down protein. One UCD, called ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency, is what doctors call a sex-linked disorder. Mothers carry the gene on their X chromosome , and they mostly pass it to their sons. Symptoms UCDs fall into two groups: Complete UCD: This means your baby has a severe or total lack of the enzyme. You’ll notice symptoms in the first couple of days: Fussy Sleepy or sluggish Can’t feed Vomits Low body temperature Problems with posture Seizures Fast breathing that becomes slow Coma Partial UCD: Your baby can make some of the enzyme, but not as much as they need. You may not spot symptoms for months or even years. A buildup of ammonia (you may hear the doctor call it hyperammonemia) can happen from illness, injury, stress , or quick weight loss. Symptoms are usually less severe than in babies with complete UCD. They include: Avoiding foods high in protein or a dislike of meat Loss of appetite Nausea or vomiting Behavior problems, including hyperactivity Mental problems (confusion, delusions , hallucinations , psychosis ) Diagnosis Most newborns in the U.S. are tested for ASS1 and ASL, but how well the tests work is different in each state. Many states test for arginase and citrin deficiencies. A handful also test for OTC and CPS1 deficiencies. If your baby starts to show symptoms after you get home, the doctor will do a physical exam . They’ll ask about your family history and do tests. They’ll look for ammonia in your child’s blood and amino acid in their blood and urine. The doctor can take a tiny piece of their liver through a process called biopsy . They’ll test it for enzymes. Genetic tests will usually confirm the diagnosis. Treatment UCDs are life-threatening. Don’t wait to get treatment. A team of health professionals will care for your child. They will first do these three treatments at the same time: Dialysis to remove ammonia from their blood Feeding them supplements of sugars, fats, and amino acids Medicines to remove extra nitrogen Long-term treatment can manage UCD symptoms. Your child will need frequent blood tests throughout their life to check ammonia levels. Stresses on their body -- like illness, injury, or surgery -- can cause their levels to rise. During those times, you’ll need to give them extra calories so their body has plenty of fuel. Long-term treatment will include: A low protein, high-calorie diet Medications to remove nitrogen Supplements of amino acids Drinking plenty of water A liver transplant can reverse the symptoms of a urea cycle disorder. Outlook There’s no cure for UCDs. Your child’s long-term health depends on which UCD they have, how severe it is, how early it was diagnosed, and how closely you follow the treatment plan. If your child doesn’t follow the special diet or they have frequent stress -induced symptoms, repeated brain swelling can lead to irreversible brain damage. If they’re diagnosed early and follow their diet, they can live a normal life."
72,What is Williams Syndrome?,"Williams syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that causes a variety of symptoms and learning issues. Children with this syndrome could have problems with their heart , blood vessels, kidneys , and other organs. Their nose, mouth , and other facial features may be unique. They sometimes have trouble learning. Children with Williams syndrome will need to see many doctors throughout their lives. But with the right treatment, they can stay healthy and do well in school. Causes Babies with Williams syndrome are born without certain genes. The symptoms they have depend on the genes they're missing. For example, someone born without a gene called ELN will have heart and blood vessel problems. The genes are usually missing in the sperm or egg before they meet up to form the baby . In a small number of cases, babies inherit the genetic deletion from a parent with the condition, but it is usually a random disorder in the genes. Symptoms Williams syndrome can cause symptoms in different parts of the body, such as the face, heart, and other organs. It can also affect a child's ability to learn. Facial Features Children with Williams syndrome have unique facial features that may include: Wide forehead Bridge of the nose is flattened Short nose with a large tip Wide mouth with full lips Small chin Small, widely spaced teeth Missing or crooked teeth Uneven eyes Folds over the corners of the eyes White starburst pattern around the iris, or colored part of the eye Long face and neck (in adulthood) Heart and Blood Vessels Many with Williams syndrome have problems with their heart and blood vessels. The aorta, the main artery that carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body, may be narrowed. The pulmonary arteries that carry blood from the heart to the lungs also may be narrowed. High blood pressure is common. Narrowed arteries don't let as much oxygen-rich blood reach the heart and body. High blood pressure and decreased blood flow can damage the heart. Growth Problems Babies born with Williams syndrome can be very small. They may have trouble eating, and might not gain weight or grow as quickly as other children. As adults, they are often shorter than most people. Personality Children with Williams syndrome may be anxious, but they also tend to be very friendly and outgoing. Learning Problems Learning problems are common in children with Williams syndrome. They range from mild to severe. Children are slower to walk, talk, and gain new skills compared to other children their age. They may have a learning disorder such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ). On the other hand , lots of children with Williams syndrome have very good memories and learn new things quickly. They tend to speak and read well, and often have musical talent. Other Possible Symptoms Curved spine , called scoliosis Ear infections Early puberty Farsightedness Hernia High levels of calcium in the blood Hoarse voice Joint and bone problems Kidney problems Urinary tract infections Diagnosis Williams syndrome is usually diagnosed before a child is 4 years old. Your doctor will do an exam and ask about your family medical history. Then the doctor will look for facial features like an upturned nose, wide forehead, and small teeth . An electrocardiogram ( EKG ) or ultrasound can check for heart problems. A bladder and kidney ultrasound can check for urinary tract conditions. Your child might get a blood test called FISH , or fluorescence in situ hybridization, to see if any genes are missing. Most people with Williams syndrome will not have the ELN gene. Because these issues can develop over time, doctors will want to see your child regularly. Treatment Many different caregivers can be involved in taking care of your child, including a: Cardiologist -- a doctor who treats heart problems Endocrinologist -- a doctor who treats hormone problems Gastroenterologist -- a doctor who treats gastrointestinal problems Ophthalmologist -- a doctor who treats eye problems Psychologist Speech and language therapist Occupational therapist Physical therapist Some of the treatments your child might need: A diet low in calcium and vitamin D to bring down high calcium levels in the blood Medicine to lower blood pressure Special education, including speech and language therapy Physical therapy Surgery to fix a blood vessel or heart problem Your child might need treatments for other symptoms, too. Living with Williams Syndrome A genetic counselor can help you learn your family's risk for Williams syndrome. This can be helpful if you plan to have children. Williams syndrome can't be cured, but treatments can help with symptoms and learning problems. Every child with Williams syndrome is different. Some can lead a very normal life. Others have more serious health and learning problems. They may need lifelong medical care.

73,What Is Hyperemesis Gravidarum?,"Many pregnant women have morning sickness . But for a few, it’s much more intense. Less than 3% of pregnant women get something called hyperemesis gravidarum . There's no cure for it, but it's temporary, and there are ways to manage it. What Is It? When you have hyperemesis gravidarum, you vomit a lot, sometimes almost constantly. This can lead to problems like dehydration and weight loss. Morning sickness often fades by the end of the first trimester , but hyperemesis gravidarum usually lasts longer. It generally strikes between the 4th and 6th week of pregnancy, and may be at its worst around weeks 9 to 13. The vomiting is so severe, most women are unable to go about their typical daily activities. Symptoms usually get better by the 20th week, but not always. Doctors don't know what causes it, but they believe it's related to a rise in hormone levels. Women who had the condition during their first pregnancy have a higher chance of getting it again during the next one. There’s no known way to prevent it, though taking a multivitamin before getting pregnant may help a little. Complications Hyperemesis gravidarum can cause problems for both you and your baby. It can affect: Your weight. Losing 5% is common. Your kidneys . They may stop working well, causing you to pee less than you should. Your mineral balance. You may have low levels of minerals, called electrolytes , that your body needs. They include sodium and potassium . When you don't have enough, it can cause dizziness , weakness, and changes in blood pressure . Your muscles. Malnutrition, electrolyte imbalance, and the need for bed rest can weaken your muscles. Your saliva . You may make too much. Swallowing it may make nausea even worse. Your doctor will need to help you manage this. Without treatment, there’s a higher chance your baby will be born prematurely or have a low birth weight. Either of these can put them at risk for health problems. Treatments Treatment depends on your symptoms and how the condition is affecting your health. Up to 5% of women with the condition need to check in to a hospital. Your doctor may first recommend: Lifestyle changes. If you can eat, have smaller, more frequent meals. Drink smaller drinks, but drink more often, and through a straw. Try cold foods if hot ones trigger nausea. Your doctor may want you to drink electrolyte-replacement sports drinks and nutritional supplements . Get enough sleep and try to manage your stress. Ginger . Taking 1 to 1.5 grams a day in several small doses may help some women. You can get it in tea, lollipops, or supplements. Pyridoxine . This vitamin, known as vitamin B6, is often prescribed for nausea in pregnancy. Typical doses are 10 mg to 25 mg, 3 times a day. Taking more may lead to temporary nerve damage. Thiamine. This vitamin (also called vitamin B1) in doses of 1.5 milligrams a day may ease vomiting. Medications . Your doctor can prescribe one or more drugs to help you throw up less. You can take them by mouth , suppository , IV, or in a shot. Antacids can also help. Another possible treatment is IV steroids . Your doctor will make sure any medications you take are safe for your baby. If you're still throwing up and dehydrated, your doctor may recommend you check in to the hospital. Once there you may get: IV fluids. Doctors will give you saline and possibly electrolytes and vitamins to help keep you hydrated. Tube feeding. If you can’t keep anything down, the doctor may give you nutrition through a tube that goes through your nose and into your stomach . In extreme cases you may need a tube connected directly to your stomach or small intestine. IV feeding. This bypasses the stomach altogether. Once you aren't vomiting so much and are able to hold down food and remain hydrated, you may be able to stop treatments. Try to remember that it does eventually stop -- and the birth of your baby will follow."
74,What Is Hypoparathyroidism?,"What Is Hypoparathyroidism? Your neck has four pea-sized glands called the parathyroid glands. Hypoparathyroidism happens when they don't make enough parathyroid hormone (PTH), are surgically removed, are damaged, or when your body is resistant to that hormone. The condition can also be hereditary. PTH controls the blood level of important vitamins and minerals such as vitamin D, calcium , and phosphorus. You may also have hypoparathyroidism because you have another condition that affects how much PTH is in your body, such as a low magnesium level. Hypoparathyroidism has a link to several other health conditions, including: Addison’s disease Cataracts Pernicious anemia Your body uses calcium to keep your nerves, muscles, and heart working. Low levels of calcium can result in symptoms ranging from mild to severe muscle spasms , tingling, heart problems, and seizures . The good news is you can treat the condition. Treatment mostly means making sure your body has enough calcium and vitamin D, which you can do by eating a balanced diet , taking supplements, and keeping an eye on blood levels. If you stick with your treatment plan and see your doctor regularly, you can lead a full, active life with hypoparathyroidism. Causes Several things can trigger hypoparathyroidism. They include: Injury or removal of the glands during surgery Autoimmune diseases Radiation therapy to your neck or head Low levels of magnesium Genetic disorders Symptoms Some of the symptoms of low blood calcium are: Muscle cramps or spasms in your legs, feet, lower back, or face Tingling in your fingers, toes, or lips Anxiety and depression Heart failure An irregular heartbeat Low blood pressure Seizures Low calcium in the long term can lead to: Cataracts Dental problems Movement disorders like tremors Hair loss and brittle nails Bone disease Getting a Diagnosis Your doctor will test your blood for calcium, PTH, phosphorus, and magnesium. Questions to Ask Your Doctor What caused my hypoparathyroidism? Do I need any more tests? How often will I need to see a doctor? What kind of treatments can help? Which do you recommend? How can I keep my calcium levels normal? What kind of lifestyle changes do I need to make? Will it ever go away? Will my children get hypoparathyroidism? If your child has the disease, ask their doctor how you can make sure they get the nutrients they need to grow. Treatment Calcium and vitamin D supplements can keep hypoparathyroidism in check. A healthy diet helps, too. Your doctor may tell you to: Limit foods with phosphates, like soda and other fizzy drinks. These can pull calcium from your bones. Eat foods high in calcium such as low-fat dairy products, dark green vegetables like collard greens and kale, and foods with added calcium like some cereals and orange juices. A dietitian can help you plan meals to keep you or your child healthy. Your child's doctor will check them regularly to see that their growth is on track. If normal calcium levels in your body are hard to maintain, you may need to get an injection of PTH. Once your calcium levels are normal again, you can go back to your regular treatment. Taking Care of Yourself Hypoparathyroidism can usually be managed with a few simple changes in lifestyle. Here are some tips. Drink plenty of water. This helps flush out extra calcium. Aim for 6-8 glasses each day. Exercise regularly. Physical activity strengthens your bones and helps ward off fractures. Ask your doctor about what kinds of exercise (and how much) are right for you. Pay attention to what you eat. Hypoparathyroidism can cause you to have too little calcium and too much phosphorus in your blood. Because of this, you might need to track how much of these nutrients you eat each day. Foods high in calcium include: Dairy products, like milk or cheese Beans Tofu Nuts, especially almonds Dark leafy greens Broccoli Some juices, breads, and cereals also have calcium added to them. If possible, try to get most of your calcium through food instead of supplements. Your body absorbs it better that way. Avoid foods high in phosphorus. It might be called phosphates or phosphoric acid in the ingredient list. These include: Fizzy drinks Processed foods Red meat Poultry Fish Dairy Hard cheeses Nuts Whole grains, like rice, oats, and bread Some vegetables Keep in mind that some foods are high in both calcium and phosphorus. Ask your doctor or nutritionist to help you figure out what's right for you. Take supplements. Your doctor might recommend calcium or vitamin D supplements. Vitamin D helps your body get more calcium from food. It also helps get rid of phosphorus. You might also need a magnesium supplement if you have low magnesium levels. The doctor can tell you how much of each supplement to take. Some supplements, like calcium, work better if you take them with food. Stay in touch with your doctor. Hypoparathyroidism can affect the whole body, especially your kidneys and bones. Your doctor can keep an eye on these organs with regular blood tests and bone density scans. See your dentist regularly. Too little calcium can hurt your teeth . What to Expect As long as you get enough calcium and vitamin D and have your blood checked regularly, you should be able to keep your hypoparathyroidism under control. If you don't take your daily supplement and watch your diet, the condition can be dangerous. Getting Support For more information, visit the web site of the Hypoparathyroidism Association ."
75,What Is Prader-Willi Syndrome?,"Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare, complicated condition that affects many parts of your body. It stems from a problem with one of your chromosomes (a strand of DNA that carries your genes). It can cause physical issues, like extreme hunger and weak muscles, as well as learning and behavioral problems. Only about 1 in 10,000 to 30,000 people in the world have PWS. Causes PWS usually happens because of genetic changes on a region of chromosome 15. There's no way to prevent it. But if you plan to have a baby, you and your partner can be screened for PWS risk. A head or brain injury can also cause the syndrome. Signs and Symptoms A baby may show signs of PWS early on. They may have almond-shaped eyes , their head may get narrow at the temples, their mouth might turn down at the corners, and they might have a thin upper lip. He also may have these symptoms: Poor muscle tone or limbs that hang loosely when you hold them Inability to suck or nurse well, so they gain weight slowly Eyes that cross or wander Appearance of being tired all the time Weak or soft cry Poor response to you In early childhood, kids with PWS start to show other signs. It affects a part of their brain called the hypothalamus -- this is what tells you you're full when you eat enough food. People with PWS don't get the feeling of being full, so the most common signs are nonstop hunger and weight gain. A child with PWS may always want more food, eat big portions , or try to hide or store food to eat later. Some kids even eat food that's still frozen or in the garbage. Your child may also: Be short for their age Have small hands or feet Have extra body fat and not enough muscle mass Have sex organs that may not develop Have mild to moderate learning problems Be slow to learn to talk, sit, stand, or walk Have temper tantrums Pick at their skin Have sleep problems Have mood and speech problems Have scoliosis -- a curved spine Have too little thyroid or growth hormones These signs of PWS are less common, but some people have them: Vision problems, like being nearsighted Lighter skin and hair color than the rest of the family High tolerance for pain Inability to keep body temperature under control during a fever or in a hot or cold place Thick saliva that can cause tooth decay or other problems Osteoporosis, or thin, weak bones that break easily Because their sex organs don't develop, women with PWS may never get a period. Or they may start their periods much later than others. Men who have PWS may not have facial hair. They may have small sex organs, and their voices may not change in puberty. People who have PWS usually aren't able to have children. Diagnosis Your doctor can usually diagnose PWS with a blood test called a chromosomal analysis. This shows if there's a problem with the gene that can cause PWS. Treatments There's no cure, but if you have a child with PWS, you can help them stay at a healthy weight, have a good quality of life, and prevent health problems down the road. Their treatment will depend on the symptoms. Babies : High-calorie formula may help an infant stay at a healthy weight if they can't eat well because of weak muscle tone. You also can use special nipples or a Gavage feeding tube, which puts breast milk or formula directly in your baby's stomach , to make sure they get enough food. Older kids and teens: Set clear limits on how and when your child eats to avoid too much weight gain. A low-calorie, balanced diet and lots of exercise can help them stay at a healthy weight. Some kids with PWS may need to take extra vitamin D or calcium . If your child tries to grab and hide food, you might lock cabinets, the pantry, or the refrigerator. For teens with PWS, hormones like testosterone, estrogen , or human growth hormone (HGH) may help with small stature, poor muscle tone, or extra body fat. Hormone replacement may build stronger bones and prevent osteoporosis later on. Antidepressants , like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), may help ease behavior problems caused by PWS. Specialized therapy can help your child deal with sleep apnea, thyroid issues, and other symptoms common to this condition. Kids with PWS should get regular eye exams to check for vision problems. Your child's doctor should screen for scoliosis, hip dysplasia, or thyroid problems . The Prader-Willi Syndrome Association has online support groups and tips for parents."
