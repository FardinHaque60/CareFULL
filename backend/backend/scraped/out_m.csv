0,Sexual Problems in Men,"['A sexual problem, or sexual dysfunction, refers to a problem during any phase of the sexual response cycle that prevents the individual or couple from experiencing satisfaction from the sexual activity. The sexual response cycle has four phases: excitement, plateau, orgasm, and resolution. While research suggests that sexual dysfunction is common (43% of women and 31% of men report some degree of difficulty), it is a topic that many people are hesitant to discuss. Fortunately, most cases of sexual dysfunction are treatable, so it is important to share your concerns with your partner and doctor.', 'What Causes Sexual Problems? Sexual dysfunction can be a result of a physical or psychological condition. Physical causes: Many physical and/or medical conditions can cause problems with sexual function. These conditions include diabetes, heart and vascular ( blood vessel) disease, neurological disorders, hormonal imbalances, chronic diseases such as kidney or liver failure , and alcoholism and drug abuse. In addition, the side effects of certain medications , including some antidepressant drugs, can affect sexual desire and function. Psychological causes: These include work-related stress and anxiety, concern about sexual performance, marital or relationship problems, depression, feelings of guilt, and the effects of a past sexual trauma.', 'Who Is Affected by Sexual Problems? Both men and women are affected by sexual problems. They can occur in adults of all ages. Among those commonly affected are seniors, which may be related to a decline in health associated with aging.', 'How Do Sexual Problems Affect Men? The most common sexual problems in men are ejaculation disorders, erectile dysfunction, and inhibited sexual desire.', 'What Are Ejaculation Disorders? There are different types of ejaculation disorders, including: Premature ejaculation . This refers to ejaculation that occurs before or very soon after penetration. Inhibited or retarded ejaculation . This is when ejaculation is slow to occur. Retrograde ejaculation . This occurs when, at orgasm, the ejaculate is forced back into the bladder rather than through the urethra and out the end of the penis . Premature ejaculation, the most common form of sexual dysfunction in men, often is due to nervousness over how well they will perform during sex. But causes are often unclear. In some cases, premature and inhibited ejaculation are caused by a lack of attraction for a partner, past traumatic events, and psychological factors, including a strict religious background that causes the person to view sex as sinful. Certain drugs, including some antidepressants , may affect ejaculation, as can nerve damage to the spinal cord or back. Retrograde ejaculation is common in males with diabetes who suffer from diabetic neuropathy ( nerve damage ). This is due to problems with the nerves in the bladder and the bladder neck that allow the ejaculate to flow backward and into the bladder. In other men, retrograde ejaculation occurs after operations on the bladder neck, or prostate , or after certain abdominal operations. In addition, certain medications, particularly those used to treat mood disorders , may cause problems with ejaculation. This generally does not require treatment unless it impairs fertility .', ""What Is Erectile Dysfunction? Also known as impotence or ED, erectile dysfunction is defined as the inability to attain and/or maintain an erection suitable for intercourse. Causes of erectile dysfunction include diseases affecting blood flow, such as atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries ); nerve disorders; psychological factors, such as stress, depression , and performance anxiety (nervousness over their ability to sexually perform); and injury to the penis . Chronic illness, certain medications, and a condition called Peyronie's disease (scar tissue in the penis ) can also cause erectile dysfunction ."", 'What Is Inhibited Sexual Desire? Inhibited desire, or loss of libido , refers to a decrease in desire for, or interest in sexual activity. Reduced libido can result from physical or psychological factors. It has been associated with low levels of the hormone testosterone. It also may be caused by psychological problems, such as anxiety and depression ; medical illnesses, such as diabetes and high blood pressure; certain medications, including some antidepressants; and relationship difficulties.', ""How Are Male Sexual Problems Diagnosed? To diagnose a man's sexual problem, the doctor likely will begin with a thorough history of symptoms. They may order other tests to rule out any medical problems that may be contributing to the dysfunction. The doctor may refer you to other doctors, including a urologist (a doctor specializing in the urinary tract and male reproductive system ), an endocrinologist (a doctor specializing in hormonal issues), a neurologist (a doctor specializing in disorders of the nervous system), sex therapists, and other counselors."", ""What Tests Are Used to Evaluate Sexual Problems? Several tests can be used to evaluate the causes and extent of male sexual problems. They include: Blood tests. These tests may be done to evaluate hormone levels as well as to check for diabetes, high cholesterol and other risk factors. Vascular assessment. This involves an evaluation of the blood flow to the penis. A blockage in a blood vessel supplying blood to the penis may be contributing to erectile dysfunction . Sensory testing. Particularly useful in evaluating the effects of diabetic neuropathy ( nerve damage ), sensory testing measures the strength of nerve impulses in a particular area of the body. Nocturnal penile tumescence and rigidity testing. This test is used to monitor erections that happen naturally during sleep. This test can help determine if a man's erectile problems are due to physical or psychological causes."", ""How Is Male Sexual Dysfunction Treated? Many cases of male sexual dysfunction can be corrected by treating the underlying physical or psychological problems. Treatment strategies may include the following: Medical treatment. This involves treatment of any physical problem that may be contributing to a man's sexual dysfunction. Medications. Medications, such as sildenafil ( Viagra ), tadalafil ( Cialis ), or vardenafil ( Levitra ), may help improve sexual function in men by increasing blood flow to the penis. Promescent is a drug used to treat premature ejaculation. The topical spray is applied to the penis and contains lidocaine , reducing sensitivity and allowing for more ejaculation control. Hormones. Men with low levels of testosterone may benefit from hormone supplementation ( testosterone replacement therapy). Psychological therapy. Therapy with a trained counselor can help a person address feelings of anxiety, fear, or guilt that may have an impact on sexual function. Mechanical aids. Aids such as vacuum devices and penile implants may help men with erectile dysfunction. Education and communication. Education about sex and sexual behaviors and responses may help a man overcome their anxieties about sexual performance. Open dialogue with your partner about your needs and concerns also helps to overcome many barriers to a healthy sex life."", 'Can Sexual Problems Be Cured? The success of treatment for sexual problems depends on the underlying cause. The outlook is good for dysfunction that is related to a treatable or reversible physical condition. Mild dysfunction that is related to stress, fear, or anxiety often can be successfully treated with counseling, education, and improved communication between partners.', ""Can Sexual Problems Be Prevented? While sexual problems cannot be prevented, dealing with the underlying causes of the dysfunction can help you better understand and cope with the problem when it occurs. There are some things you can do to help maintain good sexual function: Follow your doctor's treatment plan for any health conditions. Find out whether your prescription meds can cause sexual problems. There may be an alternative. Limit your intake of alcohol and recreational drugs. Quit smoking. Exercise regularly, eat a healthy diet, and get enough sleep . Deal with any emotional or psychological issues such as stress, depression , and anxiety. Get treatment as needed. Increase communication with your partner."", 'When Should I Call My Doctor About a Sexual Problem? Many men have a sexual problem from time to time. However, when the problems are persistent, they can cause distress for the man and their partner, and have a negative impact on their relationship. If you consistently experience sexual function problems, see your doctor for evaluation and treatment.']"
1,What Is Pseudomyxoma Peritonei?,"['Pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP) is a rare condition that usually starts with a tumor in your appendix -- though the tumor also can be in your bowel, bladder , or ovaries . Only about 1 in a million people get it. PMP may not cause any problems until the tumor grows and bursts out of the area where it started. When it enters your abdomen (belly), more tumors form and make mucinous fluid, a jelly-like material. This eventually fills up your belly, which is why PMP is sometimes known as ""jelly belly."" When this fluid builds up in your abdomen, it can push on other body parts. That causes swelling and digestion problems. It can even block your intestines or cause them to fail. This can be very serious and even life threatening. Doctors don\'t really know what causes PMP. It doesn\'t run in families. And it doesn\'t seem to be linked to anything in the environment.', ""Types Some doctors break PMP into two groups: Disseminated peritoneal adenomucinosis (DPAM) is the benign type, which means it's not cancerous. But if it's not treated, it can still be serious or even deadly. Peritoneal mucinous carcinomatosis (PMCA) is the type in which cells from the tumor do show cancer ."", 'Signs That May Point to PMP You may not have any symptoms at first. But some of the following may appear over time: Belly pain Changes in your bowel habits Enlarged ovary in women Hernia (a bulge near your groin) Poor appetite Swollen belly Weight gain or a bigger waist size', ""Diagnosis It can be hard to diagnose PMP because it may look and act like other diseases. Sometimes it's found by accident when you're being treated for something else. To find out if you have it, your doctor will examine you and ask questions about your symptoms. Then they'll want to get pictures of the inside of your belly and other areas of your body. One way to do this is by a CT scan . It takes a number of X-rays from different angles and puts them together to give more information. Sometimes you may take a special drink or get dye that makes the image easier to see."", 'A magnetic resonance imaging scan, or MRI, is another painless way to get a picture. It uses powerful magnets and radio waves to make detailed images. Other ways to diagnose PMP include: Ultrasound scan: This uses sound waves to make a picture. Laparoscopy: A fiber-optic instrument is put through a small cut in your abdomen wall so your doctor can see inside. Biopsy : A small amount of tissue is taken to be looked at under a microscope.', ""Treatment The best way to treat PMP depends on the type of tumor -- cancerous\xa0or noncancerous -- the size of the tumor, and how healthy you are. Your doctor may recommend: Wait and watch: If the tumor is small and not growing very fast, the doctor may just ask you to come in regularly to check on it. Debulking surgery: This takes out as much of the tumor as possible. It won't cure PMP, but it can help you feel better. Cytoreductive surgery: Your surgeon will take out the lining of your abdomen and any tissues that are affected. Then they'll put chemotherapy drugs into your abdomen. Afterward, more chemotherapy and another cancer-fighting drug called fluorouracil may be put in the area to kill off any cells from the tumor that were left behind. This is a major operation, and it can take a long time to recover. But it can cure PMP. Chemotherapy: If you can't have cytoreductive surgery, the doctor may suggest you have chemotherapy. The drugs may be given through your veins.""]"
2,Carcinoid Syndrome,"['What Is Carcinoid Syndrome? Carcinoid syndrome is a group of symptoms you might have with a type of cancer called carcinoid tumors. These tumors start in cells that make certain chemicals, and they release more of those chemicals into your bloodstream. The symptoms can be similar to those of other conditions like menopause or asthma . For example, there may be times when your skin suddenly gets red and warm, you have trouble breathing , or you have a rapid heartbeat. Carcinoid tumors usually grow in your stomach and intestines , but you can also get them in your lungs , pancreas , testicles, or ovaries . If you have carcinoid syndrome, it usually means the cancer has spread, most often to your lungs or liver . If your doctor finds a tumor early, they might be able to remove it. But other times, there’s no cure for carcinoid tumors. Treatments can help you live longer and better. You can also take steps to relieve the symptoms and feel more comfortable.', 'Carcinoid Syndrome Causes Carcinoid syndrome happens because the tumors can make chemicals like hormones. When the cancer has spread to your liver, these chemicals can get into your blood . There, they can travel around your body and cause symptoms. The chemicals can go directly into your bloodstream if you have tumors in your lungs, testes, or ovaries.', 'Carcinoid Syndrome Symptoms People with carcinoid syndrome may have: Skin that turns pink, red, or purple Small, widened blood vessels on their face Diarrhea Shortness of breath or wheezing Rapid heart rate Sudden drops in blood pressure', 'Carcinoid Syndrome Complications Carcinoid syndrome can lead to other problems, including: Carcinoid heart disease . This can make your heart valves get thick and leak. Medicine can help, and in some cases, you may need surgery. Bowel blockage. A tumor in the lymph nodes next to your small intestine can block your digestion. This causes severe belly pain and vomiting. You might need surgery. Carcinoid crisis. Rarely, you might have a severe episode of blushing , trouble breathing , and confusion. This is an emergency that could be life-threatening, so get medical help right away.', ""Carcinoid Syndrome Diagnosis If your doctor thinks you have carcinoid syndrome, they’ll do a physical exam and may ask you questions like: Have there been times when your skin suddenly got red and felt warm or burning? Do you often have diarrhea? Have you been short of breath? Do you sometimes wheeze? You may also need tests to look for a carcinoid tumor. Urine test . You collect your pee in containers over a 24-hour period. A lab will check it for high levels of hormones or what's left when your body breaks them down. Blood test. This could also show chemicals that the tumors release. Imaging tests . A CT scan is a series of X-rays that gives detailed views of the inside of your body. An MRI uses strong magnets and radio waves to make pictures of your organs. For radionuclide scanning, your doctor will inject you with a small amount of radioactive material, and your organs will absorb it. A special camera can spot the material and make pictures that help your doctor find a tumor."", 'Questions for Your Doctor Where are the tumors that are causing my carcinoid syndrome? What kinds of tests will I need? What treatment do you recommend? Are there any foods I should avoid? What can I do to control my skin flushing? What other symptoms should I watch out for?', 'Carcinoid Syndrome Treatment To treat carcinoid syndrome, your doctor will need to treat your tumors. You could have just one treatment or a combination of them. Surgery. Doctors may take out an entire organ that has tumors, such as your appendix , or remove only part of an affected area, such as a section of your bowel. Depending on where the tumor is, your doctor may also use an electric current to burn it off or cryosurgery to freeze it. Another option could be radiofrequency ablation. It uses a tool that sends electrical energy into the tumor to kill cancer cells. Chemotherapy . Strong medicines can often kill your cancer cells or slow their growth. You can take some of these drugs by mouth and get others through injections into a vein.', ""Radiation . This treatment can destroy cancer cells or keep them from multiplying. The radiation can come from a machine outside your body, or your doctor may place a small amount of radioactive material inside your body, in or near the tumor. Liver directed therapy. This treatment kills cancer cells in your liver by blocking their blood supply. Your doctor threads a tube called a catheter into one of the arteries that carries blood to your liver. Then, they inject particles that block the blood flow to liver tumors. Biologic drugs. This type of treatment, which is also called immunotherapy , strengthens your body's defenses. Doctors inject drugs that help your immune system kill cancer cells. Drug therapy. Injected drugs such as lanreotide ( Somatuline ) and octreotide ( Sandostatin ) can help with skin flushing. They may also have a small effect on tumor growth. Telotristat ethyl (Xermelo) along with lanreotide or octreotide can help ease diarrhea. Lanreotide and octreotide attach to carcinoid cells and cut down on the amount of chemicals they make. Their side effects can include nausea , gallstones , and pain or bruising where you inject it. In some cases, doctors give octreotide with a medicine called interferon alfa to boost your body's response."", 'Lifestyle Changes You can make smaller changes to curb the effects of carcinoid syndrome. For instance, avoid certain foods and drinks that can trigger symptoms: Alcohol Nuts Cheese Chili peppers Hot liquids It might take some trial and error to learn which are triggers for you. Your intestines could have trouble absorbing nutrients, which can lead to weight loss, weakness, and other problems. Try to eat a healthy diet, and ask your doctor whether you need to take vitamins or supplements.', ""Carcinoid Syndrome Outlook Treatment might make the tumors go away. But the cancer may not be gone completely, or it could return. You may need regular therapy to keep it in check for as long as possible. If your treatment stops working, you can focus on making sure you're as comfortable as possible. This is called palliative care ."", ""Getting Support You don't have to face things alone. Consider joining a support group where you can you share your feelings with others who understand what it's like. Learn more about carcinoid syndrome and carcinoid tumors on the website of the Carcinoid Cancer Foundation. It also has information about how to join support groups in your area.""]"
3,Mesothelioma,"[""Mesothelioma is cancer of the mesothelium, a membrane that lines the inside of the body's cavities, such as the abdomen or chest. Three out of every four cases of mesothelioma disease begin in the chest cavity. Mesothelioma can also begin in the abdominal cavity and around the heart. Regardless of where they originate, malignant cells from the mesothelium can invade and damage nearby tissues. Cancer cells can also metastasize, or spread, to other parts of the body. Often by the time mesothelioma is diagnosed, the disease is advanced. The 5-year survival rate is around 5% to 10%. Most patients with mesothelioma of the lung die as a result of respiratory failure or pneumonia. Some patients get a small-bowel obstruction when the tumor extends through the diaphragm, a muscle that separates the chest and abdominal cavity. A smaller number people die of complications of the heart when the tumor invades the pericardium -- a thin sac that surrounds the heart -- and the heart itself."", 'Causes of Mesothelioma The main risk factor for mesothelioma is working with asbestos. Asbestos is a group of minerals with thin microscopic fibers. Because these fibers are resistant to heat, fire, and chemicals and do not conduct electricity, asbestos has been mined and used widely in the construction, automotive, and other industries. If tiny asbestos fibers are released into the air, as they are in the manufacturing process, they can be inhaled or swallowed, leading to serious health problems. As many as 75% of mesothelioma cases can be linked to exposure to asbestos at work. There is also some evidence that family members and others living with asbestos workers have an increased risk of developing mesothelioma, and possibly other asbestos-related diseases. This risk may be the result of exposure to asbestos dust brought home on the clothing and hair of asbestos workers. Cases of mesothelioma have also been seen in people living close to asbestos mines. However, mesothelioma has been reported in some individuals without any known exposure to asbestos. Other, uncommon, but possible causes include: Zeolites. These minerals are chemically related to asbestos. One of these related minerals, erionite, is common in the soil in some areas of Turkey, according to the American Cancer Society. Exposure to erionite is believed to be responsible for high rates of mesothelioma rates in those areas.', 'Radiation. The American Cancer Society notes that there have been a few published reports of mesotheliomas that developed following exposure to high doses of radiation to the chest or abdomen or after injections of thorium dioxide (Thorotrast), a material used by doctors in some chest X-rays until the 1950s. SV40 virus. Some studies in laboratory animals have raised the possibility that infection with the simian virus 40 (SV40) might increase the risk of developing mesothelioma, according to the American Cancer Society. Some injectable polio vaccines given between 1955 and 1963 were contaminated with SV40, exposing as many as 30 million people in the U.S. to the virus. So far, the largest studies addressing this issue in humans have not found an increased risk for mesothelioma or other cancers among people who received the contaminated vaccines as children. Genetics. Some experts believe certain people may be genetically predisposed to mesothelioma. Rates of the disease vary among populations.', ""Symptoms of Mesothelioma Mesothelioma symptoms commonly do not appear until 20 to 50 years after initial asbestos exposure. The main symptoms of mesothelioma of the lungs are shortness of breath and chest pain. Accumulation of fluid in the pleura caused by the mesothelioma, if sufficiently large, may also contribute to the shortness of breath. Symptoms of peritoneal (abdominal) mesothelioma can include: Weight loss Swelling and pain in the abdomen Blood clotting abnormalities Bowel obstruction Anemia Fever If cancer has spread to other parts of the body, symptoms may include pain, swallowing difficulties, or swelling of the neck or face. Because many conditions share these symptoms, having these symptoms doesn't necessarily mean you have mesothelioma. It's important to see your doctor to determine what is causing them."", 'Medical History and Physical Exam Because mesothelioma is uncommon, it is often misdiagnosed at first. If you have symptoms that suggest you might have mesothelioma, your doctor will likely take a complete medical history to check for symptoms and possible things that raise your risk of having the disease, especially asbestos exposure. Exposure to asbestos is the No. 1 thing that makes mesothelioma more likely.', 'Your doctor will also ask about your general health and do an exam to check for possible signs of mesothelioma. These may include fluid in the chest cavity, abdomen, or pericardium (the thin membrane around the heart). Depending on the findings of the exam, your doctor may refer you for mesothelioma testing.', 'Tests for Mesothelioma There are several different types of mesothelioma tests. These include: Blood tests. Blood levels of three substances -- fibulin-3, osteopontin, and soluble mesothelin-related peptides (SMRPs) -- are often higher in people with mesothelioma. Although these blood tests cannot confirm a diagnosis of mesothelioma -- more study is needed before they can be of reliable use in a clinical setting --\xa0high levels of these substances make the disease more likely. Fluid and tissue sample tests. If you have a buildup of fluid in the body that may be related to mesothelioma, your doctor can remove a sample of the fluid by putting a needle through the skin into the area of fluid buildup. The fluid can then be examined under a microscope for cancer cells. If cancer cells are found, further tests can tell if the cancer is mesothelioma.', ""This test goes by different names, depending on where the fluid is: Thoracentesis -- chest cavity Paracentesis -- abdomen Pericardiocentesis -- membrane around the heart Even if your doctor does not find mesothelioma cells in fluid, that doesn't necessarily mean you don't have mesothelioma. Sometimes samples of actual tissue (biopsies) are needed to diagnose mesothelioma. Biopsies. There are ways to remove tissue to be examined for mesothelioma. They include: Needle biopsy. This involves inserting a long, hollow needle through the skin to remove a tiny piece of a tumor. Your doctor may use imaging tests to guide the needle into the tumor. In some cases, the sample may be too small to make a diagnosis and a more invasive procedure is needed. Thoracoscopy, laparoscopy, and mediastinoscopy. In these procedures, the doctor inserts a thin, lighted scope through a small cut in the skin to see potential areas of mesothelioma. Small tools, put in through other cuts, can be used to remove pieces of tissue to examine under a microscope. The specific procedure depends on the area being examined: Thoracoscopy examines the space between the lungs and chest wall. Laparoscopy examines the inside of the abdomen. Mediastinoscopy examines the center of the chest, around the heart. Surgical biopsy. In some cases, more invasive procedures may be needed to get a large enough tissue sample to make a diagnosis. In that case, a surgeon may perform a thoracotomy (opening the chest cavity) or laparotomy (opening the abdominal cavity) to remove a larger sample of tumor or the whole tumor. Endobronchial ultrasound-guided biopsy. This procedure involves passing a long, thin, flexible tube down the throat to examine the lungs for tumors. The tube also has an ultrasound, so the doctor can better identify the tumor and the proper place to biopsy. If a tumor is found, the doctor can remove a small sample of it through the tube. Imaging tests. These tests allow your doctor to view the inside of your body without making cuts. Imaging tests commonly used in mesothelioma diagnosis include: Chest X-ray. An X-ray of the chest may show abnormal thickening of or calcium deposits on the lung lining, fluid in the space between the lungs and chest wall, or changes in the lungs, which could suggest mesothelioma. Computed tomography (CT). The CT scan is a procedure that uses multiple X-rays and a computer to create detailed images of the inside of the body. CT scans are often used to look for signs of cancer, help find where the cancer is, and to check if the cancer has spread. Positron emission tomography (PET). This test involves giving a shot of a compound containing a radioactive atom and then taking pictures of the body. Cancer cells absorb large amounts of the radioactive compound and show up brighter than normal tissue on the images. Doctors then focus further tests on these areas of potential cancer. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI scans use radio waves and strong magnets to make detailed images of the body. Because they provide detailed images of soft tissues, they may help your doctor find where the tumor is. For mesotheliomas that involve the diaphragm (a dome-shaped muscle under the lungs), MRI scans may be particularly useful."", 'Prognosis for Mesothelioma Certain things affect a mesothelioma prognosis as well as your options for mesothelioma treatment. They include the following: The stage of the cancer, or the extent of cancer in the body. The stage is usually based on the size of the tumor, whether there are cancer cells in the lymph nodes, and whether cancer has spread beyond its original site. The size of the mesothelioma Whether the mesothelioma can be removed completely by surgery The amount of fluid in the chest or abdomen Your age and general health The type of mesothelioma cells Whether the cancer has just been diagnosed or has already been treated and come back', 'Treatments for Mesothelioma Treatment for mesothelioma depends on a number of things, including those mentioned above. Three standard types of treatment are used: surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. Treating mesothelioma often involves a combination of two or all three. Surgery. The main surgeries used in mesothelioma treatment are: Wide local excision, which removes the cancer along with some of the healthy surrounding tissue Pleurectomy and decortication, in which the surgeon removes part of the covering of the lungs, chest lining, and outside surface of the lungs Extrapleural pneumonectomy, which involves removing one whole lung and part of the lining of the chest, the diaphragm, and the lining of the sac around the heart Pleurodesis, which involves using a chemical or drug to make the lung lining scar and stick to the lung. The scarring stops the buildup of fluid. This is used for symptom control and isn’t meant to be a cure.', 'Radiation therapy. This type of cancer treatment uses high-energy X-rays and other types of radiation to kill mesothelioma cells or keep them from growing. Radiation may be given externally or internally. External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. Internal radiation uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into the area near the mesothelioma. Chemotherapy. This uses drugs to stop the growth of cancerous mesothelioma cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Chemotherapy can be given by mouth, injected into a vein or muscle to enter the bloodstream and reach mesothelioma cells throughout the body, or it can be placed directly into the affected area of the body to mainly affect mesothelioma cells in that area. Sometimes, doctors use more than one chemotherapy drug. This is called combination chemotherapy.', 'Immunotherapy. This uses certain drugs to help your immune system fight cancer. The combination of nivolumab (Opdivo) and ipilimumab (Yervoy) is approved by the FDA for unresectable mesothelioma. That’s mesothelioma that has spread over a large portion of the body and can’t be treated with surgery. Tumor-treating fields (TTF). This type of treatment uses chemotherapy and electric fields with specific frequencies to slow the division of cancer cells.']"
4,What's Wrong With My Toe?,"[""Toes are small, but they have a large job. They help you walk and run and keep your balance, too. So if your toe hurts, it can be a big deal. There are a lot of reasons you may have an aching toe. There's always the chance you stubbed it, of course, or banged it up while playing sports. But there are also problems like hammertoe or arthritis that could be to blame. Watch out for some telltale symptoms and check with your doctor to figure out the cause."", ""Hammertoe, Mallet Toe, and Claw Toe If one or more of your toes are crooked or curled under, you may have hammer, mallet, or claw toe. Your foot has a strange shape because the muscles, tendons, or ligaments that surround your toe aren't balanced. This causes the toes to bend in an odd position. Your toe may hurt. It's also common to develop a corn or callus because the joint rubs the inside of your shoe. Each condition has its own distinctive look:"", ""Hammertoe. The middle joint of your toe bends downwards. This causes your toe to rise up instead of lying flat. It usually occurs in your second, third, and fourth toes. Mallet toe. Your toe bends down at the joint closest to the nail. Like hammertoe, it often happens in your second, third, and fourth toes. Claw toe. Like the name suggests, your toes make a claw shape. The joint at the base of the toe bends up, while the two other joints bend down. This causes your toe to curl and dig into the soles of your shoes. Causes. A main cause is wearing high heels or shoes that don't fit properly. Too-tight shoes can crowd your toes, forcing them into a bent position. After a while, the muscles tighten and shorten. Pretty soon you can't straighten your toe. You may be more likely to get these problems because of your genes. For instance, your risk goes up if you have a certain foot shape, such as a long second toe. Some diseases, such as arthritis and diabetes , can also lead to trouble."", 'Treatments. If you can still flex your toe, your doctor may suggest exercises to stretch and strengthen the muscles. They include scrunching a towel and picking things up off the floor with your toes. Wearing roomy shoes can also help. They should be at least a half-inch longer than the big toe. Your doctor may recommend wearing shoe inserts or pads to relieve some of the pressure. Over time, the bend in your toe may become permanent and rigid. These cases are more serious. You may need surgery.', ""Turf Toe and Stiff Big Toe (Hallux Rigidus) Does only your big toe ache? You could have a condition called turf toe or the aptly named stiff big toe (hallux rigidus). Turf toe. It's a sprain to the joint at the bottom of your big toe. This injury causes pain and swelling. You may not be able to move your big toe much. Walking and other weight-bearing activities can make it ache more. Causes. You can get turf toe if you bend your big toe upward too much. Running or jumping can also jam the big toe. Over time these movements can lead to a sprain. You often get it when you dance or play sports like soccer or football."", ""Treatments. Your doctor may suggest a home remedy called RICE: rest, ice, compression, and elevation. You'll need to stay off the foot, ice the toe for 20 minutes every 4 hours, wrap it with a medical bandage, and prop up your foot to ease swelling. You may also have to wear a walking boot or stiff-soled shoe to keep from moving the toe. Stiff big toe. It's a type of arthritis that leads to pain and stiffness in the joint at the base of your big toe. You're more likely to get it if you're between 30 and 60. Causes. Athletes or workers who are on their feet a lot may overuse the big toe. That puts stress on the joint. An injury or disease, such as osteoarthritis , can also lead to the condition. Your genes may also be partly to blame. Treatments. In the early stages, you can treat stiff big toe with anti-inflammatory medicine and hot or cold packs to relieve the pain. Steroid shots also ease the swelling. Your doctor may suggest you wear wide shoes with thick, curved soles. If the pain doesn't go away, you may need surgery."", ""Morton's Neuroma Do you have a tingling pain in your toes or the ball of your foot? Nerve damage like Morton's neuroma could be the cause. Besides tingling or numbness in your toes, you may also get a feeling like you're standing on a pebble or have a burning pain in the ball of your foot. It's most common between the third and fourth toes. Causes. It's not entirely certain what causes Morton's Neuroma, but one of the nerves that leads to your toes becomes irritated, likely involving collapse of the transverse arch that places traction and increased pressure on the interdigital nerve. That's usually caused by pressure that's due to a foot problem like bunions , hammertoes, or too-tight shoes. You can also get it if you play sports where your feet pound the ground, such as running. Females are approximately five times more likely than males to develop Morton neuroma. Wearing high-heels has also been linked to Morton's neuroma. You can get relief from symptoms if you switch to shoes with lower heels and more room for your toes. Treatments. Arch supports that you put in your shoe can bring relief. You can buy them over-the-counter, or your doctor may prescribe one that's custom-made. If the pain keeps up, you may need steroid shots or surgery."", ""Broken Toe or Bone Bruise Swollen, painful toes could mean you have a bone injury like a broken toe or a bone bruise. Broken toe. Your toe may be broken if it swells, throbs, and looks bruised. Also called a fracture, this injury hurts. The pain may get worse when you stand or walk. Causes. There's often no mystery about why it happens. It could be that you stubbed your toe or dropped something heavy on it. Sometimes, though, you can get tiny breaks in the bone from the regular impact of activities such as running and basketball. This is called a stress fracture. Treatments. Most of the time, you won't need surgery. To help your bone heal, the ends will have to be set in place.

5,Dental Health With Crooked Teeth and Misaligned Bites,"[""There are several reasons why some people's teeth grow in crooked, overlapping, or twisted. Some people's mouths are too small for their teeth , which crowds the teeth and causes them to shift. In other cases, a person's upper and lower jaws aren't the same size or are malformed, resulting in either an overbite , when there is excessive protrusion of the upper jaw, or an under bite, when the lower jaw protrudes forward causing the lower jaw and teeth to extend out beyond the upper teeth.\xa0Learn more about what causes an overbite , as well as how to tell the difference between an underbite vs overbite . Most often crooked teeth , overbites, and underbites are inherited traits just as the color of your eyes or size of your hands. Other causes of misaligned bites are early loss of baby or adult teeth; improper fit of dental restorations (for example, fillings or crowns); gingivitis ( gum disease ); undue pressure on the teeth and gums; misalignment of the jaw after an injury; tumors of the mouth or jaw; or common oral health problems in children such as thumb sucking, tongue thrusting, pacifier use beyond the age of three, or prolonged use of a bottle."", 'What Problems Come With Crooked Teeth and Misaligned Bites? Crooked teeth and misaligned bites can: Interfere with proper chewing. Make keeping teeth clean more of a challenge, increasing the risk of tooth decay, cavities , and gingivitis . Strain the teeth, jaws, and muscles, increasing the risk of breaking a tooth. Make people feel self-conscious about their appearance and affect their self-esteem.', 'How Do I Know if My Teeth Are Crooked or My Bite Is Misaligned? While you can see for yourself if teeth are crooked, your dentist can determine if the problem warrants treatment. Your dentist will look for the following signs: Abnormal alignment of teeth Abnormal appearance of the face Difficulty or discomfort when chewing or biting Speech difficulties, including a lisp Your dentist will usually refer you to an orthodontist -- a dentist who specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of crooked teeth and misaligned jaws.', 'What Tests Can I Expect at the Orthodontist? The orthodontist will likely take X-rays , photographs of your face, and teeth impressions to determine if and what type of treatment is needed. X-rays provide information on the position of your teeth and roots and if any teeth have yet to come through the gums. Special cephalometrics or panoramic X-rays show the relationship of the teeth to the jaws and the jaws to the head. Your orthodontist may also want to take regular photographs of your face to further examine the relationship between the teeth, jaws, and head. Finally, impressions may be made of your teeth. This is done by having you bite down on a soft material that is later used to create an exact copy of your teeth.', ""How Are Crooked Teeth and Misaligned Bites Treated? Once a diagnosis is made, your orthodontist can decide the best treatment for your teeth or misaligned bite. For some people, a removable retainer (to stabilize the new position of teeth) will be all that's needed to correct the problem. In very rare cases, removal of one or more teeth may be required if overcrowding is the main problem. For most people, braces are necessary to correct the problem. In rare and extreme cases, such as an extreme overbite or underbite, an operation may be necessary. Learn more about correcting an overbite without braces.""]"
6,Signs of Child Abuse,"['What Are the Signs of Child Abuse? When you think of child abuse, your first thought may be of a child with bruises or other marks that raise red flags. But the signs aren’t always so clear. Abuse can be physical, sexual, or emotional. Or a child may be neglected, meaning their caregivers don’t provide for basic needs, like food or safety. What makes abuse even harder to stop is that most of the time, the abuser is someone the child knows. They may be reluctant to say something because they may want to protect that person or they are afraid of what the abuser will do if they speak up. It’s important to know how to recognize different types of abuse, and what you can do if you suspect it.', 'Types of Child Abuse Child abuse happens when someone harms a child’s body or emotional health, development, and well-being. There are 4 main types. Physical abuse means that someone hurts a child’s body or puts them in physical danger. It doesn’t matter if the child gets seriously hurt or if it leaves a mark. Any harm is abuse. It includes when someone: Burns a child Hits, kicks, or bites Holds the child under water Shakes or throws the child Throws objects at the child Ties up the child', 'Sexual abuse is any kind of sexual activity with a child, not just physical contact. It includes when someone: Forces a child to take part in pornographic pictures or videos Has any sexual contact with the child, from kissing in a sexual way to having sex Makes phone calls or sends emails, texts, or other messages that are sexual in any way Shows the child someone else’s genitals, as with “flashing” Shows pornography Tells “dirty” jokes or stories Emotional abuse is a pattern of behaviors that harm a child’s emotional well-being and development. This can mean when someone: Abuses others when the child is around, such as a parent, brother, sister, or pet Fails to show love and affection Ignores the child and doesn’t give emotional support and guidance Shames, belittles, criticizes, or embarrasses Teases, threatens, bullies, or yells', 'Neglect is when a caregiver doesn’t give the child basic care and protection, such as: Clothing Food Heat in cold weather Housing with clean living conditions Medical care', ""Neglect is also when someone leaves the child alone for long stretches of time or under dangerous conditions. Other types of child abuse include: Parental substance abuse. This happens when adults neglect or harm children through the use of drugs or alcohol . It includes situations like: A parent not able to care for a child because they're high on drugs or alcohol Giving illegal drugs or alcohol to a child Making methamphetamine (meth) while a child is around A pregnant woman's abuse of drugs or alcohol, which exposes her baby to these substances Medical neglect or abuse. A child is medically neglected when their caregivers don't provide them with needed medical or mental health treatment. Medical abuse is a rare situation in which a caregiver lies about a child's symptoms or harms them to try to get unnecessary medical attention. It's also called Munchausen syndrome by proxy . Abandonment. Many states consider this a form of child neglect. It happens when a parent leaves a child with no support or concern for their well-being, or when the parent's location is unknown. Human trafficking. This is basically a type of slavery. Children are trafficked when they're used for prostitution or pornography, or to beg, sell drugs, or work long hours for little pay."", 'Signs of Child Abuse Abuse can be hard to recognize. Kids can get cuts and bruises or show signs of stress for lots of reasons that are a normal part of childhood. So it helps to know specific signs to look for, and trust your gut as you look at the whole picture of the child’s physical and emotional health. Signs of physical abuse may include: Bruises, welts, or other injuries that can’t be explained or don’t match with the child’s story Burns , especially from cigarettes, that can’t be explained Injury marks that have a pattern, like from a hand, belt, or other objects Injuries that are at different stages of healing Medical or dental issues that go untreated', 'Kids who’ve been physically abused may also: Avoid any kind of touch or physical contact Be afraid to go home Seem to always be on high alert Wear clothing that doesn’t match the weather -- such as long sleeves on hot days -- to cover up bruises Withdraw from friends and activities', 'Signs of sexual abuse may include: Avoiding a certain person for no clear reason Bloody, torn, or stained underwear Bruising or bleeding around the genitals Pain or itching around the genitals that might cause problems walking or sitting Pregnancy or STDs , especially for children under 14 years old Refusing to change clothes in front of others Running away from home Sexual activity or knowledge that people usually have only when they’re older Signs of emotional abuse may include: Constant worry about doing something wrong Speech problems or delays in learning and emotional development Depression and low self-esteem Doing poorly in school Extreme behavior, such as being way too obedient or way too demanding Headaches and stomachaches with no clear cause The child doesn’t seem close to a parent or caregiver Showing little interest in friends and activities Signs of neglect may include: Always looking dirty Being left alone or in the care of other young children Eating more than usual at a meal or saving food for later Missing a lot of school Poor weight gain and growth Doesn’t get medical, dental, or mental health care (medical neglect)', 'You may see the same signs of neglect in children whose parents or caregivers abuse alcohol or other drugs. Signs of child trafficking could include: Missing school often Running away from home Sudden changes in style of dress or relationships Has an older ""boyfriend"" or ""girlfriend"" They talk about needing to pay off a debt They often care for children who aren\'t members of their family Their responses to questions seem rehearsed', 'What to Do if You Suspect Abuse If you suspect child abuse, it’s important to report it. It isn’t a private matter or a family problem. A child’s physical and emotional well-being, and maybe even their life, could be at stake.', 'You don’t need proof to report abuse. If you suspect it, call your local child protective services, police, a hospital, or a hotline, such as the Childhelp National Child Abuse Hotline at 800-422-4453. You don’t have to give your name.', ""If you suspect child trafficking, call the National Human Trafficking Hotline at 888-373-7888. Depending on the situation, there are many ways you can help the child: If they need medical care right away, call 911. Take the child to the hospital -- it’s a haven for abused children. Doctors can check for signs of abuse and give medical care. Help the child stay safe. If you think someone like a babysitter or day-care worker has abused your child, keep the child away from them and contact police. If you suspect a parent or caregiver, supervise the child while they're around that person. If the abuse happened at school, tell the principal about it. But report it to your local or state child protection agency, too. Help the child get therapy to start healing the emotional damage of the abuse. Encourage the child to talk to you about what happened. But don't make it an interrogation. Focus on listening. Make sure they feel supported and know this is not their fault. It’s best to not confront the abuser yourself. Instead, contact police or a child protection agency and let them handle it.""]"
7,Paget's Disease of the Breast,"[""What Is Paget's Disease of the Breast? Paget's disease of the breast is a rare type of cancer that forms in or around your nipple. It’s involved in 1% to 4% of all breast cancers. It may be linked with an underlying breast cancer , either ductal carcinoma in situ or invasive breast cancer . You might also hear it called Paget’s disease of the nipple or mammary Paget disease."", 'Who Gets Paget’s Disease of the Breast? Things that can make you more likely to get Paget’s disease of the breast include: Age. Your chances go up as you get older. The average age at diagnosis is 57. Sex. Paget’s can affect men and women, but women are more likely to get it. Race. White women are more likely to get breast cancer than black or Hispanic women, but black women are most likely to die from it. Alcohol . Drinking heavily makes it more likely. Dense breasts . This will show up on a scan called a mammogram. Extra weight . This is especially true after menopause or if you gained weight as an adult. Family history . Your chances go up if your parents or siblings had breast cancer . Gene changes. You might hear them called mutations. BRCA1 and BRCA2 make you more likely to get breast and ovarian cancers, but they lead to fewer than 1 out of 10 breast cancers. History of breast cancer. If you’ve had it in either breast, your chances are higher. History of unusual things in your breast (abnormalities). Having lobular carcinoma in situ or atypical hyperplasia raises your odds. Hormone replacement . Taking estrogen after menopause makes cancer more likely. Radiation . If you got radiation to your chest as a child or young adult, you’re more likely to get breast cancer.', ""Paget's Disease of the Breast Symptoms Early symptoms include redness, light scaling, and flaking of the skin on your nipple. You might have only mild irritation, not enough to send you to the doctor. Your skin could get better on its own. This doesn’t mean the disease has gone away."", 'Further symptoms can be a sign of serious damage to your skin. You might notice: Tingling Itching More sensitivity Burning Pain Bloody or yellowish discharge from your nipple Oozing or bleeding areas A nipple that looks flattened against your breast Thickened skin in the nipple area A lump or mass in your breast In most cases, the disease starts in the nipple and then spreads to the areola (the circular area of darker skin that surrounds it) or other areas of your breast. Sometimes, it affects only the areola, where it can look like eczema , an itchy red rash . Rarely, this condition can affect both breasts.', 'Paget’s Disease of the Breast Causes Doctors aren’t sure what causes it. Paget’s is rare, but most people who get it have tumors in the same breast. One theory is that cancer cells from the tumor travel through milk ducts and into your nipple and areola.', ""Paget's Disease of the Breast Diagnosis Your doctor will do a test called a biopsy . They’ll take a small sample of tissue from your nipple and send it to a lab, where a technician will check for Paget's cells. Your doctor will take the sample in one of a few ways: Surface biopsy. They’ll gently scrape cells from the surface of your skin. Shave biopsy. They’ll use a very sharp tool to take off the top layer of skin. Punch biopsy. A special circular tool called a punch takes a small, round piece of tissue. Wedge biopsy. Your doctor uses a scalpel to take a small chunk of tissue. In some cases, the doctor removes the entire nipple. Because most people with this condition also have underlying breast cancer, your diagnosis will probably include: A physical exam Imaging tests such as: A mammogram (an X-ray of the breast) Breast MRI (a scan that makes a detailed picture of the inside of your breast) Breast ultrasound (uses sound waves to make a picture of your breast)"", ""Paget's Disease of the Breast Treatment The treatment depends on the underlying breast cancer. You might have one or more these: Mastectomy . Your surgeon removes your entire breast. Lumpectomy . If the disease affects only your nipple and the area around it, your doctor could suggest this treatment to save your breast. They might call it breast-conserving surgery. The surgeon will remove your nipple, your areola, and the part of the breast where they think the cancer is. Radiation. High-energy radiation can kill cancer cells. It might come from a machine outside your body (external) or from a small implant in your breast (internal). Chemotherapy. Certain drugs also kill cancer cells. You can get them in a pill that you swallow or in a liquid that goes into your vein (intravenous). Hormonal therapy. These drugs keep estrogen from reaching cancer cells so cancer doesn’t grow or come back. They work on cancers that are positive on a hormone receptor (HR) test. You could get a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) or an aromatase inhibitor (AI). They come in pills."", 'Paget’s Disease of the Breast Complications Cancer treatment can have side effects that last a long time or that start weeks, months, or years after you finish treatment. These include: Pain and numbness (peripheral neuropathy) Swelling in your arms or legs (lymphedema) Bone loss (osteoporosis) Infertility Heart problems Blood clots New cancer', 'Paget’s Disease of the Breast Prevention There’s no definite way to prevent cancer, but some lifestyle changes can help make it less likely. Keep a healthy weight. Get regular exercise. Moderate to high-intensity activity is best. Limit how much alcohol you drink. Experts recommend no more than one drink a day for women and two for men. Breastfeeding may also lower your risk of breast cancer. If you have one or more breast cancer risk factors, talk to your doctor about further steps, including: Testing to look for changes in your genes More frequent checkups or screening tests Medicines to block estrogen such as raloxifene and tamoxifen Breast removal surgery (prophylactic mastectomy)', ""Paget's Disease of the Breast Outlook The outlook depends on: If you have a tumor in the affected breast If the tumor is ductal carcinoma in situ or invasive breast cancer The stage of invasive breast cancer in that breast If you have invasive cancer in the affected breast and it’s spread to nearby lymph nodes About 83% of women in the U.S. diagnosed with this condition from 1988 to 2001 lived at least 5 more years. By comparison, about 87% of women diagnosed with any kind of breast cancer in that period lived at least 5 more years. For women with both Paget's disease of the breast and invasive cancer in the same breast, the 5-year relative survival rate went down with each stage of the cancer: Stage I: 95.8% Stage II: 77.7% Stage III: 46.3% Stage IV: 14.3%""]"
8,Tips to Manage Your Migraine Headaches,"['Migraine headaches can interrupt your life, but there are a number of things you can do to manage them so that they interfere less. A trip to the doctor can help you work out the right plan for a specific attack with medication and rest. But there are things you can do on a daily basis to help make your headaches happen less often and lessen their force.', 'Listen to Your Doctor Once your doctor takes a full medical history and comes up with a treatment plan for your migraine attacks, it’s important to follow the plan as closely as you can. In general, your doctor -- often a special headache doctor called a neurologist -- will suggest you try to treat an attack at the earliest sign of symptoms. This often gives the best chance of success. In many cases, the medication and the dosage are carefully chosen to prevent the need for further doses, which for some medications can cause a “rebound” or “overuse” effect over the long term.', 'Sleep, Diet, and Exercise These are three important parts of managing migraine headaches . A regular schedule that allows you to get the sleep you need to function properly (about 8 hours) is essential to lessen the number of migraine attacks you get and ease their symptoms. Nurture a routine that agrees with your natural rhythms. Try to keep a regular, soothing bedtime routine, avoid screen time before bed, and, perhaps most importantly, wake up at the same time every day. The effect of diet differs from person to person. Look for foods that may “trigger” a migraine attack. A migraine diary might help with this, and your doctor can help narrow down the probable culprits. A diary can also help you work out other things in your life that might trigger a migraine, so you can manage them. These also differ from person to person, but might include: Emotional stress Physical stress Lack of sleep or a change in sleep patterns Smoking Too much alcohol or caffeine Caffeine withdrawal', 'In addition, a healthy, balanced diet and regular mealtimes can help keep migraines at bay. Some people find that smaller, more frequent meals can be even better at managing symptoms. Regular exercise , especially if it’s outside, can regulate your sleep and eating rhythms, and it seems to be another key part of managing migraine headaches. Shoot for 30 minutes on most days of the week. It’s a good idea to try to maintain a healthy body weight , because obesity raises your risk for chronic daily headaches. A healthy diet, exercise , and sleep routine will help get you on the right track.', 'Relaxation Techniques Meditation , along with relaxation and breathing techniques, and even mental health therapies seem to help people with migraines. Some common approaches include: Meditation: There are lots of approaches to meditation. All make you stop and observe. That means you stop the flow of thoughts in your mind and concentrate on a single thing, typically your breathing. Done on a regular basis, meditation, or “mindfulness practice” as some call it, can help your response to pain , including migraine.', 'Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT): This is a psychotherapy approach that helps you change thought patterns and behaviors that can make you more tense and raise your risk for a migraine attack. Ask your doctor or mental health specialist about a professional who can help you with this approach. Biofeedback : This technique uses electronic devices to measure breathing rate, heart rate , skin temperature, skin perspiration, muscle tension, and other physical responses. It then “feeds back” this information in the form of graphs or sounds from a computer that suggest you are getting more tense or less tense. Over time, you try to learn to control your body’s response so that you’re less tense. Some research suggests this could help with migraine. Yoga : This ancient Hindu practice mixes careful breathing and calming meditation with body poses that stretch and strengthen your muscles and tendons.', 'Find Your Community You can also reach out to organizations and support groups that may be able to help.', 'The National Headache Foundation works to improve headache treatment and serves as a resource for people who get headaches, doctors, other health professionals, and the public. Check the foundation’s website for information, email it directly at [email\xa0protected] , or call 888-643-5552 for nonemergency guidance about migraine care. Move Against Migraine is an online community run by the American Migraine Foundation for those with migraine headaches. Miles for Migraine offers expert-led community groups to discuss migraine pain and treatment several times a week.']"

But with long-term medication and therapy, it can be managed well.', ""Bipolar Disorder Causes Bipolar disorder is a complex condition. Experts haven't found an exact cause for it, but several things likely play a role, including: Your genes. Studies show that bipolar disorder can run in families. It's not because of a single gene that you inherit from your parents, but likely several. And genes aren't the only factor. Childhood trauma . Some experts think there could be a link between childhood trauma (like emotional, physical, or sexual abuse) and bipolar disorder. But more research needs to be done. Stress. Either one very stressful event, like the loss of a loved one, or ongoing daily stress, like worries about money, may help trigger bipolar disorder symptoms. How your brain works. If you have bipolar disorder, your brain may work differently than someone who doesn't have this condition. For instance, the brain chemicals that control how your brain functions could be out of balance."", ""Bipolar Disorder Risk Factors The following may raise your risk of bipolar disorder: A family history. For instance, if a direct relative (like a parent or sibling) has it, you're more likely to be diagnosed too. A traumatic event or time of intense stress. Drug or alcohol use.

Cyclothymic disorder You have this type of bipolar disorder if: You\'ve had hypomanic and depressive episodes for 2 years or longer (for adults) or 1 year for children and teens. Your symptoms are less intense or don\'t last long enough for you to be diagnosed with bipolar I or bipolar II.

They may suggest that you keep track of your moods for a while to see if any patterns emerge. Or they may ask to talk with some of your family members so they can get more insight into your moods. Your doctor will take into account how severe your symptoms are, \xa0how long they last, and how often they happen. To be diagnosed with bipolar disorder, your symptoms must match the ones listed in the DSM-5, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, published by the American Psychiatric Association."", 'Bipolar Disorder Treatment Based on your symptoms, your doctor could suggest: Medication for bipolar disorder', ""Many prescription medications can help lessen your symptoms. For instance: Mood stabilizers like lithium can help lessen or prevent mood episodes. They're often prescribed as a long-term treatment. Antidepressants can help boost your depressed mood. They must be taken with a mood stabilizer so they don't trigger a depressive episode. Anticonvulsants are another type of drug that can help keep your mood steady. Your doctor might prescribe this type if lithium doesn't work for you. Antipsychotics are often given during a manic or hypomanic episode, especially if you're experiencing a break from reality. Your doctor may also give you a medicine to help relieve other issues you're having, like anxiety or trouble sleeping. Talk therapy Talking to a mental health expert can help you better understand and manage bipolar disorder. Your doctor could suggest that you try: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT): You'll get a better idea of how your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors impact each other. Interpersonal and social rhythm therapy: You'll focus on improving your relationships with others while building a daily routine for sleep, waking up, and exercise. Studies show that both of these can help stabilize your moods. Psychoeducation: Either by yourself or with a group of others, you'll learn what may trigger your mood episodes and ways you can manage them.

Regular exercise, whether high-impact kinds like running or swimming or gentle types like yoga, can help lessen symptoms of anxiety and depression. Keep a routine. Try to go to bed, wake up, eat meals, and exercise at the same time every day. Avoid drugs and alcohol. They can make your symptoms worse. Find a support system. Being open with friends and family can help them understand what you're going through and know how to help you. You could also join a support group with others living with bipolar disorder. Stick with treatment, even when you feel good. Managing symptoms of bipolar can be a challenge. Don't stop or change any of your medications without talking to your doctor."", ""Bipolar Disorder Stigma Unfortunately, it's common for people living with bipolar disorder to face a lack of understanding, negative beliefs, and discrimination. That can start to affect your quality of life and how you interact with other people at work, school, and in your personal life. You may even face stigma within your own family. As public awareness about bipolar disorder grows, \xa0the stigma around it will hopefully lessen over time. Until then, talk to your doctor and therapist about steps you can take to feel more comfortable with your diagnosis and treatment."", ""Takeaways Bipolar disorder is a mental health condition that causes extreme shifts in your mood. While there's no cure, it's treatable with medication and therapy. Finding a doctor and therapist you trust and building a strong support system will help you stick to your treatment plan and manage your symptoms throughout your life.""]"
10,What's the Treatment for Croup?,"['Croup can be uncomfortable and unsettling for your little one. The cough and other symptoms can range from mild to severe. Most mild cases of this condition can actually be treated at home.\xa0Here are four ways to make your baby more comfortable if they have croup. Keep them calm . Croup causes your little one’s airways to get inflamed and narrow. This can make it hard for them to breathe . But the more they cry and the more worked-up they get, the worse their symptoms will become. Try to keep your baby as calm as possible. Sing to them, cuddle with them, and read them stories. Moisten the air. Use a cool-mist humidifier to moisten dry air. If you don’t have a humidifier, run a hot shower in your bathroom. Once the air is nice and steamy, sit in the bathroom with your baby for 10 minutes. It may help quell their cough . If it’s cool outside, open a door or window for a few minutes. Fresh, cool air may calm their symptoms, too. You might even take your baby for a car ride with the windows rolled down.', 'Give them fluids . It’s important to keep your baby hydrated if they have croup. Warm, clear fluids can help loosen mucus and take pressure off their vocal cords. If they’re very young or really cranky, give them small amounts of fluid using a spoon or medicine dropper. Keep their head elevated . Prop up your little one’s head with an extra pillow when they turn in at night. But don’t use pillows with babies under 12 months of age. You might also consider sleeping in the same room with your child so you can know right away if they start having breathing problems . If you take your child to the doctor or emergency department, they may be given mist treatment and a single dose of a glucocorticoid medication such as dexamethasone or prednisolone, which are usually given as an oral syrup. The medication reduces inflammation.', 'When to Call the Doctor If your child’s symptoms last more than 3 to 5 days or get worse, don’t try to treat them at home. Get medical help right away if your child: Makes a noisy, high-pitched sound when they breathe in (doctors call this “stridor”) Starts drooling or has trouble swallowing Is constantly cranky, irritable, or uncomfortable Has very hard, labored breathing Has neck or chest muscles that “pull in” when they breathe Is very tired , sleepy, or hard to awaken Turns bluish or dark around their lips, under their nose, mouth , or around their fingernails Is dehydrated with few wet diapers']"
11,Food and Appetite Problems After a Stroke,"['If you’re recovering from a stroke , it’s important to eat well to nourish your body. It gives you the energy you need to stay active, do rehabilitative therapy , and get back to your daily activities. It also can make it less likely that you will have another stroke . But eating may not be as simple as it was before your stroke . Brain damage can make it harder to move your muscles, make you more sensitive to pain , and affect your appetite and moods . Here are some ways a stroke can affect normal eating, and what you can do: Trouble swallowing. You may choke, cough , or gag while you eat. Or find that liquid comes out of your nose when you try to swallow. It usually gets better over time, but a few tips can help: Stick to soft foods. Items like cooked cereal , mashed potatoes, soup , cottage cheese , and applesauce are all easier to eat. If you want to try tougher foods, cut them into small pieces or chop them in a blender to make them easier to chew. Thicken your liquids. It’s important to drink enough fluid to avoid dehydration . But water and other thin liquids can go down the wrong pipe. Ask your doctor if you should thicken drinks with tapioca, matzo meal, cornstarch, or banana or potato flakes. See a speech therapist. They can guide you through exercises to strengthen your tongue , lips, throat, and mouth muscles, which will help you swallow. If that doesn’t help, your therapist may suggest neuromuscular electrical stimulation. It uses a device to send electrical impulses to nerves in the throat to strengthen the swallowing muscles. They may also recommend prescription medications like muscle relaxers, which can open your throat and make swallowing easier. Problems using utensils. A stroke can make the muscles in your arms or hands weaker, which makes it hard to use forks, knives, and spoons. Try: Flatware with larger and thicker handles that are easier to hold. You can switch to knives with curved blades that let you cut food with one hand . Plate guards. They help you scoop the food against a wall on the plate while you eat with one hand. Rubberized pads. You can put one under your plate or bowl to keep it from sliding. Adaptive kitchen equipment. You may need special tools to help you cook one-handed, such as easy-grip scissors, battery-powered peelers, and specially designed cutting boards.', 'Loss of appetite. You may not feel as hungry as you usually do. If you’re depressed, you may not feel like eating. Or the stroke could have damaged the part of your brain that controls your senses, which can affect your sense of taste or smell. To work up a stronger appetite, try to: Choose foods with strong flavors. Look for options that are low in saturated fat and salt, like citrus fruits, herbs, and spices. Opt for colorful foods like salmon, carrots, and dark green veggies that might look more appetizing. These foods also are full of heart -healthy nutrients that will lower your risk for another stroke. Eat high-calorie foods in your meal first. If you’re truly not hungry, also try a liquid supplement for added energy and nutrients. Exercise lightly, such as walking , to ramp up your appetite. Have your dentures checked. If they don’t fit well, they can hurt your mouth and make you want to eat less. See your dentist at least once a year.', 'Don’t ignore your mental health . Depression is common after a stroke. It can make you feel sad and anxious, steal your appetite, and give you trouble sleeping . Your doctor can prescribe an antidepressant , or you can see a therapist or counselor for talk therapy . No energy. You may feel too tired to get out of bed, let alone make it to the grocery store and fix a full meal. You can make healthy eating easier with a few savvy steps: Make breakfast your biggest meal. You’ll probably have the most energy to cook in the morning. Keep your last meal simple, like a sandwich or cereal. If even that’s too hard, try 6 small meals a day instead of 3 larger ones. Buy pre-cut, pre-washed fruits and veggies. It can make prepping and eating these nutritious foods a breeze. Ask friends and family members to make dishes that you can freeze and reheat on those days when you’re too pooped to cook. Check if you can sign up for a local Meals on Wheels program to get foods delivered to you for little or no money. Generally, you can take advantage of this nonprofit program if you’re 60 and older. Share meals with someone. Whether it’s having dinner with a loved one or caregiver, or stopping by your local senior center for lunch, it’s good to make meals into social events. This way, your companion can make sure you’re eating properly and give you any help you need.']"
12,What Are Hot Flashes?,"[""What Is a Hot Flash? Hot flashes are the most common symptom of perimenopause and menopause, which is the natural time when your ovaries stop releasing eggs and your period stops. Doctors\xa0refer to hot flashes as vasomotor symptoms (VMS). During a hot flash, you have a feeling of intense heat in your face, neck, and chest. You may also sweat large amounts and feel chilly afterward. Some of the most common symptoms as you approach menopause are hot flashes or night sweats. They can wake you up with soaked hair, clothes, and sheets. (Photo Credits: The Image Bank/Getty Images) More than two-thirds of people assigned female at birth (AFAB) in North America who are in perimenopause or menopause have hot flashes. They can also affect those whose ovaries don't release enough estrogen either due to chemotherapy or because their ovaries have been removed during a hysterectomy."", ""What Does a Hot Flash Feel Like? Hot flashes can be different for everyone. Some people may not have symptoms that bother them, while other people have symptoms that affect their daily lives. However, common symptoms may include: Feelings of intense, internal heat A lot of sweating (When it happens at night, it's called night sweats, and it may wake you up.) Flushing (skin becomes hot and red), especially in the face, neck, and chest Chills after the hot flash is over due to excessive loss of body heat Increased heart rate of about 7-15 beats per minute Feelings of anxiety"", 'Hot Flash Causes During a hot flash, your core body temperature and skin temperature increase, generally in your fingers, arms, chest, abdomen, back, and legs. Blood flow also increases in these areas, which can make you sweat more. In some people, metabolic rate will also increase, which may cause your heart rate to increase. Metabolic rate is the number of calories you burn as you go about your day-to-day living. Hot flashes during periods Some people get hot flashes as part of their normal premenstrual syndrome (PMS) symptoms. Changes in your hormone levels around the time of your period can change the way your body regulates your body temperature. This can lead to hot flashes or night sweats. This may start happening as you enter perimenopause, which is the time when your body goes through the changes that lead to menopause (when your period stops). Perimenopause generally lasts about 3-4 years, but it can last as long as 10 years. So, many people AFAB will start perimenopause in their 40s, or even their 30s.', ""If you've entered perimenopause, your period will also likely become irregular. Perimenopause may also cause changes in menstrual bleeding. It can result in periods that are lighter or heavier, last longer, or come closer together. You may also notice spotting between periods. Pregnancy hot flashes Having hot flashes and night sweats during pregnancy is common. In one study, about 35% of pregnant people said they had hot flashes at some point while pregnant. This is probably due to hormone changes your body goes through during pregnancy. It may be more common during your first trimester (weeks 1-14) and third trimester (weeks 27 to childbirth). Just because you have hot flashes doesn't mean you're necessarily in perimenopause or menopause. Some medical conditions and medicines may also cause hot flashes or night sweats. But, if a medical condition is causing your hot flashes, you'll usually have other symptoms, too. Medical conditions or medicines that can cause hot flashes include: Viral infections , such as the cold, flu, COVID-19, or HIV Bacterial infections , such as tuberculosis, endocarditis (inflammation of your heart), or osteomyelitis (inflammation of your bone or bone marrow) Hormonal disorders , such as an overactive thyroid, endocrine tumors, or diabetes Substance abuse of alcohol, heroin, or cocaine Neurologic disorders , such as autonomic dysreflexia, autonomic neuropathy (damage to the nerves that control your heart rate, blood pressure, respiration, digestion, and sexual arousal), syringomyelia (a cyst in your spinal cord), and stroke Mood disorders , such as panic disorder or anxiety Sleep disorders , such as obstructive sleep apnea Digestive disorders , such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) Some cancers , especially leukemia and lymphoma Cancer medicine , such as aromatase inhibitors, tamoxifen, opioids, and steroids Other medicines , such as antidepressants, diabetes medicine, steroids, acetaminophen, aspirin, and high blood pressure medicines"", 'Hot Flash Triggers Things that can trigger a hot flash include: Hot weather, heated rooms, or getting overheated by an activity Smoking Caffeine Alcohol Spicy foods Stress Tight clothes Why are hot flashes worse at night? Hot flashes at night can cause drenching sweat that soaks through your night clothes, waking you up and preventing you from getting back to sleep. This is probably why hot flashes seem worse at night. Your body temperature usually drops a bit at night so you can sleep. But, hormone changes that affect your body temperature may be more noticeable at night, especially if it wakes you up to a drenching, cold sweat.', 'How Long Do Hot Flashes Last? Hot flashes generally last 1-5 minutes, although some episodes can last an hour. In terms of duration of symptoms, most people get hot flashes for about 4 years. You may only have them for a while during perimenopause, or you may continue to have them after your period stops. A few people may have them for the rest of their lives, but they generally become less frequent or less intense as time goes on.', ""How to Stop Hot Flashes Hot flashes will usually go away eventually without any treatment. However, in the meantime, they can really disrupt your life. Small lifestyle changes may help give you relief from hot flashes. Some self-care options that can help you manage your hot flashes include: Don't smoke or use tobacco products. People who smoke or use tobacco products may have more hot flashes than people who don't. Exercise regularly. Sedentary people may have hot flashes more often than people who exercise regularly. However, do check in with yourself while you exercise, as overheating can trigger a hot flash. Exercise in a cool room if you think this may be a problem for you. Lose weight. If you're carrying extra body weight, it can make your hot flashes worse. Avoid spicy foods, caffeinated drinks, and alcohol. These can all trigger hot flashes. Keep cool. Dress in layers so you can take clothes off when you're too warm. Open windows and use a fan or stay in the air conditioning as much as possible. Sip cold drinks when you're feeling too warm."", 'Practice mind-body therapies, such as: Mindfulness meditation Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) Acupuncture Deep breathing Guided imagery Hypnosis Try some natural remedies. Nonprescription, herbal, and over-the-counter therapies may help some people manage their symptoms. Botanicals and herbs may have side effects or change how other medications work, so ask your doctor before you add any new supplements to your health care routine. Some supplements that may help with your symptoms include: Plant or soy estrogens (although it may be more helpful to add these foods to your diet than to take supplements) Black cohosh Evening primrose oil Ginseng Dong quai Wild yam Vitamin E', ""Hot Flash Treatments If lifestyle changes and natural remedies aren't easing your hot flashes, talk to your doctor about taking medicine, such as hormone replacement therapy . Doctors usually prescribe estrogen to treat hot flashes. It may also help other menopause symptoms, such as vaginal dryness or mood disorders. But this may not be a good option for you if you are at risk of breast or endometrial cancer, heart disease, stroke, or blood clots."", 'If you\'ve had a hysterectomy, you may be able to take estrogen alone, but if you have a uterus, you will likely need to take progesterone and estrogen to avoid increasing your risk of cancer in the lining of your uterus (endometrial cancer). Your doctor will adjust your dose to the minimum amount required to ease your symptoms. They will also recommend hormone replacement only as long as it is helping your symptoms and not increasing your risk of heart disease, stroke, or blood clots. If you can\'t take oral progesterone because the side effects are uncomfortable, you can try a combination drug containing bazedoxifene plus conjugated estrogens called Duavee. Other nonhormone treatments that may help you manage hot flashes include: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants, such as: Citalopram (Celexa) Desvenlafaxine (Pristiq) Escitalopram (Lexapro) Fluoxetine (Prozac) Paroxetine (Paxil, Pexeva), including a low-dose form (Brisdelle) that is FDA-approved to treat hot flashes Venlafaxine (Effexor) Other prescription medicines that are used ""off-label"" (which means that they aren\'t FDA-approved for hot flashes but are used because they\'re effective) include: Clonidine (Catapres, Kapvay), a high-blood pressure medicine Fezolinetant (Veozah), a medicine that acts on brain chemicals that help you regulate your body temperature Gabapentin (Neurontin, Gralise), an anti-seizure medicine Oxybutynin (Ditropan XL, Oxytrol), an overactive bladder medicine Pregabalin (Lyrica), another anti-seizure medicine', 'Hot Flash Prevention There’s nothing you can do to completely prevent hot flashes around menopause. But you can stay away from triggers that may make them more frequent or more severe. Common ones include: Stress Caffeine Alcohol Spicy foods Tight clothing Heat Cigarette smoke', ""Hot Flash FAQs At what age do hot flashes start? Everyone is different, so it's hard to give a precise age for any person. Most people AFAB will start perimenopause in their late 40s to early 50s. So, this is generally when hot flashes start for most people. Are there foods that can help with my hot flashes? Plant estrogens may have weak estrogen-like effects on your body, which can help with your symptoms. This may be why people AFAB who grew up in cultures where vegetarian diets are common say they get fewer hot flashes. Some foods that have plant estrogens include: Soybeans, tempeh, and tofu Chickpeas Lentils Ground flaxseeds Whole grains Vegetables Fruits Red clover How many hot flashes a day is normal? Everyone's body is different, but according to research, most people say they have about four to five per day.""]"
13,Causes of Stress,"[""The kids won't stop screaming, your boss has been hounding you because you turned a report in late, and you owe the IRS thousands of dollars you don't have. You're seriously stressed out. Stress is actually a normal part of life. At times, it serves a useful purpose. Stress can motivate you to get that promotion at work, or run the last mile of a marathon. But if you don't get a handle on your stress and it becomes long-term, it can seriously interfere with your job, family life, and health. More than half of Americans say they fight with friends and loved ones because of stress, and more than 70% say they experience real physical and emotional symptoms from it. Read on to learn why you get stressed out, and how that stress might be affecting your health."", 'Causes of Stress Everyone has different stress triggers. Work stress tops the list, according to surveys. Forty percent of U.S. workers admit to experiencing office stress, and one-quarter say work is the biggest source of stress in their lives.', 'Causes of work stress include: Being unhappy in your job Having a heavy workload or too much responsibility Working long hours Having poor management, unclear expectations of your work, or no say in the decision-making process Working under dangerous conditions Being insecure about your chance for advancement or risk of termination Having to give speeches in front of colleagues Facing discrimination or harassment at work, especially if your company isn\'t supportive Life stresses can also have a big impact. Examples of life stresses are: The death of a loved one Divorce Loss of a job Increase in financial obligations Getting married Moving to a new home Chronic illness or injury Emotional problems (depression, anxiety, anger, grief , guilt, low self-esteem) Taking care of an elderly or sick family member Traumatic event, such as a natural disaster, theft, rape, or violence against you or a loved one Sometimes the stress comes from inside, rather than outside. You can stress yourself out just by worrying about things. All of these factors can lead to stress: Fear and uncertainty. When you regularly hear about the threat of terrorist attacks, global warming, and toxic chemicals on the news, it can cause you to feel stressed, especially because you feel like you have no control over those events. And even though disasters are typically very rare events, their vivid coverage in the media may make them seem as if they are more likely to occur than they really are. Fears can also hit closer to home, such as being worried that you won\'t finish a project at work or won\'t have enough money to pay your bills this month. Attitudes and perceptions. How you view the world or a particular situation can determine whether it causes stress. For example, if your television set is stolen and you take the attitude, ""It\'s OK, my insurance company will pay for a new one,"" you\'ll be far less stressed than if you think, ""My TV is gone and I\'ll never get it back! What if the thieves come back to my house to steal again?"" Similarly, people who feel like they\'re doing a good job at work will be less stressed out by a big upcoming project than those who worry that they are incompetent. Unrealistic expectations. No one is perfect. If you expect to do everything right all the time, you\'re destined to feel stressed when things don\'t go as expected. Change. Any major life change can be stressful -- even a happy event like a wedding or a job promotion. More unpleasant events, such as a divorce, major financial setback, or death in the family can be significant sources of stress. Your stress level will differ based on your personality and how you respond to situations. Some people let everything roll off their back. To them, work stresses and life stresses are just minor bumps in the road. Others literally worry themselves sick.', 'Effects of Stress on Your Health When you are in a stressful situation, your body launches a physical response. Your nervous system springs into action, releasing hormones that prepare you to either fight or take off. It\'s called the ""fight or flight"" response, and it\'s why, when you\'re in a stressful situation, you may notice that your heartbeat speeds up, your breathing gets faster, your muscles tense, and you start to sweat. This kind of stress is short-term and temporary (acute stress), and your body usually recovers quickly from it. But if your stress system stays activated over a long period of time (chronic stress), it can lead to or aggravate more serious health problems. The constant rush of stress hormones can put a lot of wear and tear on your body, causing it to age more quickly and making it more prone to illness. If you\'ve been stressed out for a short period of time, you may start to notice some of these physical signs: Headache Fatigue Difficulty sleeping Difficulty concentrating Upset stomach Irritability', 'When stress becomes long-term and is not properly addressed, it can lead to a number of more serious health conditions, including: Depression High blood pressure Abnormal heartbeat ( arrhythmia ) Hardening of the arteries ( atherosclerosis ) Heart disease Heart attack Heartburn, ulcers, irritable bowel syndrome Upset stomach -- cramps , constipation , and diarrhea Weight gain or loss Changes in sex drive Fertility problems Flare-ups of asthma or arthritis Skin problems such as acne, eczema, and psoriasis Managing your stress can make a real difference to your health. One study showed that women with heart disease lived longer if they underwent a stress management program.']"
14,Morning Sickness,"[""What Is Morning Sickness? Morning sickness is nausea and vomiting that happens during pregnancy . More than half of pregnant women have nausea and vomiting , especially during the first trimester. Despite its name, you can have morning sickness at any time of day. It doesn't mean your baby is sick, and it doesn't hurt the baby. Pregnancy nausea is probably caused by the sudden increase of hormones in your body. It's usually mild and goes away about midway through your pregnancy. Some women never feel nauseated during their pregnancy. Some women get a severe form of morning sickness called hyperemesis gravidarum . This happens when severe nausea and vomiting leads to dehydration or causes the woman to lose more than 5% of her pregnancy body weight . Sometimes, she may not get enough nutrients, leading to malnourishment. The woman may have to stay in the hospital to get fluids, medication , and rarely, a feeding tube ."", 'Morning Sickness Symptoms General symptoms of morning sickness include: Nausea with or without vomiting during the first trimester that feels like motion sickness Nausea that comes on in the morning but can resurface at any time or go on all day Feeling sick from smelling certain foods and other odors Nausea after eating, especially spicy foods Nausea or vomiting brought on by heat and severe salivation', ""Call your doctor if you: Have flu -like symptoms, which may be a sign of illness Feel dizzy or lethargic Have severe vomiting constantly or several times a day Can't keep down any fluids or foods and are losing weight Think your nausea may be caused by iron in your prenatal vitamin Want to take anti-nausea medication or try a treatment like acupuncture"", ""Morning Sickness Causes and Risk Factors Experts aren’t sure, but pregnancy hormones may cause nausea. In the case of severe nausea and vomiting, there could be another medical condition that isn’t related to pregnancy. Things that may make you more likely to have morning sickness include: Morning sickness during a previous pregnancy A sensitive stomach before pregnancy. This includes motion sickness, migraines , sensitivity to certain smells or tastes, or taking birth control pills . You're pregnant with twins or other multiples. You’ll have higher levels of the pregnancy hormone hCG than a woman carrying one baby . You’re at higher risk of hyperemesis gravidarum if: You're expecting a girl.

If your doctor suspects you have hyperemesis gravidarum, they may also order urine or blood tests.', ""Morning Sickness Treatment and Home Remedies For moderate to severe morning sickness, your doctor may recommend: Vitamin B6 supplements (pyridoxine) Natural remedies like ginger Over-the-counter drugs like doxylamine ( Unisom ) Prescription anti-nausea medications for persistent symptoms Extra fluids if the symptoms are severe enough to cause dehydration To treat hyperemesis gravidarum, you may need to stay in the hospital and get: Fluids through a vein (intravenous, or IV) Anti-nausea medications (antiemetics) Corticosteroid medications You can also try some of these home remedies: Eat five or six small meals instead of three big ones. Take a multivitamin regularly. Don't take it on an empty stomach . Avoid smells that upset your stomach. Eat saltine crackers, dry toast, or dry cereal before you get out of bed to calm your stomach. Avoid spicy and fatty foods. When you feel nauseated, eat bland foods that are easy to digest, like rice, bananas, chicken broth, gelatin, or ice pops. Take in plenty of fluids. Suck on ice or sip water , weak tea , or clear sodas like ginger ale when you feel nauseated. Aim for six to eight cups of non-caffeinated fluids per day. Get fresh air. Go outdoors and take a walk, or just open a window. Rinse your mouth after vomiting. This will keep the acid in your stomach from damaging your teeth . You can also add baking soda to a cup of water before rinsing for more protection. Some women find that acupressure wristbands ease nausea. Acupuncture , in which hair-thin needles are put into your skin at specific points, might also relieve symptoms. Herbal ginger supplements can relieve nausea. Most studies show ginger to be safe, but talk to your doctor before taking any supplement. Some women find relief with essential oils in calming scents like lavender. Hypnosis might also relieve nausea.""]"
15,Can Diabetes Affect Your Eyes?,"['Yes. You should plan to make regular eye doctor visits when you have diabetes .

In fact, diabetes is the primary cause of blindness in adults ages 20 to 74.', ""Blurry Vision Don't buy new glasses as soon as you notice that things look blurry. It could just be a small problem caused by high blood sugar . Your lens could swell, which changes your ability to see. To correct it, you need to get your blood sugar back into the target range (70-130 milligrams per deciliter, or mg/dL, before meals, and less than 180 mg/dL 1 to 2 hours after a meal). It may take as long as 3 months for your vision to fully get back to normal. Do tell your eye doctor. They\xa0can let you know if this is a symptom of a more serious problem."", 'Cataracts The natural internal lens of your eye allows your eye to see and focus on an image, just like a camera. When that lens gets cloudy, like a dirty or smudged window, that means a c ataract has formed. Anyone can get them , but people with diabetes tend to get them earlier, and they get worse faster.', ""When part of your lens is cloudy, your eye can’t focus like it should. You won't see as well. Symptoms include blurred vision and glare. You’ll need surgery to remove a cataract. The doctor replaces the cloudy lens with an artificial one."", 'Glaucoma People with diabetes are more likely to have glaucoma, which can come in several forms or types. Pressure builds up inside your eye when fluid can’t drain like it should. This can damage nerves and blood vessels, and cause changes in vision. Medications can treat open-angle glaucoma , the most common form. They lower eye pressure, speed up drainage, and reduce the amount of liquid your eye makes. (Your doctor will call this aqueous humor.) This type of glaucoma may not cause any symptoms until it’s further along and you have major vision loss . Your doctor can catch it earlier, during an annual exam.', 'With less common forms of the disease, you might notice: Headaches Eye aches or pain Blurred vision Watery eyes Halos around lights Vision loss', 'Treatment can include medicine and special eye drops. Surgery and laser treatments can help lower eye pressure. If you have diabetes, you’re also more likely to get a rare condition called neovascular glaucoma. This makes new blood vessels grow on the iris, the colored part of your eye. They block the normal flow of fluid and raise eye pressure. The primary treatment of neovascular glaucoma is to reverse the formation of new blood vessels. For this, your doctor may use a laser to reduce the number of blood vessels in the back of the eye, or they\xa0may use an anti-VEGF injection, while using other measures to quickly lower the eye pressure.', ""Diabetic Retinopathy The retina is a group of cells on the back of your eye that take in light. They turn it into images that the optic nerve sends to your brain . Damage to small blood vessels in your retina causes diabetic retinopathy . It's related to high blood sugar levels . If you don’t find and treat it early, you could go blind. The longer you have diabetes, the more likely you are to get it. If you keep your blood sugar under control, you lower your chances."", ""People with type 1 diabetes rarely develop the condition before puberty . In adults, it's rare to see unless you've had type 1 diabetes for at least 5 years. If you keep tight control of your blood sugar with either an insulin pump or multiple daily insulin injections, you’re far less likely to get this condition. If you have type 2 diabetes, you may have signs of eye problems when you’re diagnosed. Control your blood sugar, blood pressure , and cholesterol to slow or prevent the disease. If you smoke, try to quit. It’ll improve your eyes and your overall health. There are other types of this condition: Background retinopathy. Your blood vessels are damaged, but you can still see OK. It can get worse if you don't manage your diabetes well."", ""Maculopathy. This occurs when diabetes affects the macula. The macula is the area of your retina that provides the best vision necessary for reading, driving, and other similar activities. The swelling that occurs may be easily reversible, or more serious and difficult to treat. Proliferative retinopathy. It happens when cells at the back of your eye don’t get enough oxygen and new blood vessels start to grow. They’re fragile, so they can bleed and lead to a clot. This can cause scars and pull your retina away from the back of your eye. If it gets detached, you could have vision loss that can't be fixed. Sometimes this condition can be treated. Surgery is an option, so is a laser procedure that burns away the blood vessels. It can prevent blindness in up to half the people with early retinopathy."", ""The Need for Eye Exams A full yearly checkup can help find problems early, when they're easier to treat.

But when grief takes over your life and you begin to feel hopeless, helpless, and worthless, then it's time to talk to your doctor about telling the difference between normal grief and depression."", ""What Is Grief? Grief is a natural response to death or loss. The grieving process is an opportunity to appropriately mourn a loss and then heal. The process is helped when you acknowledge grief, find support, and allow time for grief to work. Each year, between 5% and 9% of the population loses a close family member. But that's not the only kind of loss that can cause grief. People can feel loss when: They become separated from a loved one They lose a job, position, or income A pet dies or runs away Kids leave home They have a major change in life such as getting a divorce , moving, or retiring"", ""While we all feel grief and loss, and each of us is unique in the ways we cope with our feelings. Some people have healthy coping skills. They're able to feel grief without losing sight of their daily responsibilities. Other people don't have the coping skills or support they need. That hinders the grieving process."", 'How Do We React to Grief and Loss? There are specific stages of grief. They reflect common reactions people have as they try to make sense of a loss. An important part of the healing process is feeling and accepting the emotions that come as a result of the loss. People go through common stages of grief: Denial, numbness, and shock: Numbness is a normal reaction to a death or loss and should never be confused with ""not caring."" This stage of grief helps protect us from experiencing the intensity of the loss. It can be useful when we have to take some action, such as planning a funeral, notifying relatives, or reviewing important papers. As we move through the experience and slowly acknowledge\xa0its impact, the initial denial and disbelief fades.', 'Bargaining: This stage of grief may be marked by persistent thoughts about what ""could have been done"" to prevent the death or loss. Some people become obsessed with thinking about specific ways things could have been done differently to save the person\'s life or prevent the loss. If this stage of grief isn\'t dealt with and resolved, the person may live with intense feelings of guilt or anger that can interfere with the healing process. Depression : In this stage, we begin to realize and feel the true extent of the death or loss. Common signs of depression in this stage include trouble sleeping, poor appetite, fatigue , lack of energy, and crying spells. We may also have self-pity and feel lonely, isolated, empty, lost, and anxious. Anger: This stage is common. It usually happens when we feel helpless and powerless. Anger can stem from a feeling of abandonment because of a death or loss. Sometimes we\'re angry at a higher power, at the doctors who cared for a lost loved one, or toward life in general.', ""Acceptance: In time, we can come to terms with all the emotions and feelings we experienced when the death or loss happened. Healing can begin once the loss becomes integrated into our set of life experiences. Throughout our lives, we may return to some of the earlier stages of grief, such as depression or anger. Because there are no rules or time limit to the grieving process, everyone's healing process will be different."", 'What Can Get in the Way of the Healing Process? Some things can impede or slow down the healing process following a death or loss. They include: Avoiding emotions Compulsive behaviors Minimizing feelings Overworking on the job Misusing drugs , alcohol, or other substances as a way to deal with emotional discomfort', ""What Things Might Help Resolve Grief? Acknowledge and accept both positive and negative feelings. Allow plenty of time to experience thoughts and feelings. Confide in a trusted person about the loss. Express feelings openly or write journal entries about them. Find bereavement groups in which there are other people who've had similar losses. Remember that crying can provide a release. Seek professional help if feelings are overwhelming."", ""What Can I Do if My Grief Won't Go Away? If grief continues and causes a prolonged and deep depression with physical symptoms such as poor sleep , loss of appetite, weight loss , and even thoughts of suicide , you may have a condition known as complicated bereavement. Talk with your doctor as soon as possible. Sometimes, a major depression can develop along with the normal feelings of loss or sadness linked with grief. Whereas normal sadness as part of a grief reaction may subside after several months, major depression is a medical disorder that is different from normal grief, can occur at any time (even in the immediate aftermath of a death of loss), and requires treatment to be resolved.""]"
17,What Is Ameloblastoma?,"[""Ameloblastoma is a rare kind of tumor that starts in your jaw, often near your wisdom teeth or molars. It's made from cells that form the enamel that protects your teeth . The tumor can cause pain or swelling and can change the look of your face. If it goes untreated for a long time, it may become cancerous and spread to your lymph nodes or lungs . Anyone can get one of these growths, but they're most often seen in adults ages 30 to 60. In the United States, between 300 and 600 cases are diagnosed every year."", ""Symptoms The tumors usually grow slowly over many months or even years. For a while, the only symptom may be swelling in the back of your jaw. You also might have tooth or jaw pain. Some people don't have any symptoms. It's found when they have an imaging scan done for some other reason. Occasionally, ameloblastomas grow quickly and painfully. This can uproot and move your teeth. They also can spread to your nose, eye socket, or skull. In rare cases, they can grow so large that they block your airway, make it difficult to open and close your mouth, or affect how your body takes in nutrients from food."", ""Cause Doctors aren't sure what causes ameloblastomas or why certain people get them. They do know they're more common in men than in women, and certain genes seem to play a role. An injury to your jaw or an infection in your mouth also might raise your risk. And scientists think some viruses or a lack of protein or minerals in your diet may be linked to them as well."", ""Diagnosis Dentists often spot these tumors on X-rays -- they can look like soap bubbles on film. They also can be diagnosed with the following: MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): Powerful magnets and radio waves are used to make images of your mouth. CT (computerized tomography) scan: Several X-rays are taken from different angles and put together to show more detailed information. Your doctor may want to take a small sample of tissue to look at under a microscope. To take the sample, they'll use a needle or make a small cut. This is called a biopsy , and it can confirm it's an ameloblastoma and help determine how fast it's growing."", ""Treatment Drugs and radiation don't seem to have much effect on most non-cancerous ameloblastomas, so they're usually treated with surgery. To make sure the tumor cells don't grow back, your doctor will take out the tumor and some of the healthy tissue around it. Part of your jaw may need to be removed, as well as some of the arteries and nerves that affect your face. Your doctor will recommend surgery to re-create your jaw using bone from somewhere else in your body or artificial bone. You also may need rehabilitation to learn how to smile and chew again. After surgery, you'll have a CT scan to make sure the tumor is gone. You should have follow-up scans for the next 5 years or so to make sure it's not growing back. If a tumor does come back, it's more likely to become cancer . If it spreads to other parts of your body, radiation is usually recommended to slow or stop its growth. Scientists hope to find new treatments that can shrink these tumors without surgery. They're testing drugs that fight cancers linked to similar problem genes to see if they have the same effects on ameloblastomas.""]"
18,Children and Teens With Bipolar Disorder,"[""Although bipolar disorder more commonly develops in older teenagers and young adults, it can appear in children as young as 6. In recent years, it's become a controversial diagnosis. Some experts believe it is rare and being overdiagnosed; others think the opposite. At this point, it's hard to be sure just how common it is. Another diagnosis, called Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD) also has been established to describe children ages 6-18 who have severe and persistent irritability and temper outbursts that don't meet conventional definitions of bipolar disorder . So it's important not to jump to conclusions. If your child is diagnosed with bipolar disorder , you might want to get a second opinion before embarking on a treatment plan. Make sure you're comfortable with your child's health care provider."", 'Bipolar Disorder in Young Children Diagnosing bipolar disorder in young children is difficult, because many of the symptoms are similar to those of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) or conduct disorders -- or even just normal, childhood behavior. One problem is that medications used for ADHD are often stimulants, which can potentially trigger mania in children with bipolar disorder .', ""Young children in a manic phase might be more irritable than adults; they may be more likely to have psychotic symptoms, hearing and seeing things that aren't real. During a depressive episode, they might be more likely to complain of physical symptoms, like aches and pains. One of the most notable differences is that bipolar disorder in children cycles much more quickly. While manic and depressive periods may be separated by weeks, months, or years in adults, they can happen within a single day in children."", ""How Can I Help my Bipolar Child? As the parent of a child with bipolar disorder, there's a lot you can do to keep your child well. Here are some suggestions. Follow the medication schedule. You absolutely must make sure that your child gets the medication they need\xa0for bipolar disorder. Use timers, pillboxes, notes, or whatever it takes for you to remember. If your child needs medication at school, talk to their teacher or school nurse -- schools may not allow students to take medication on their own. Monitor side effects. Most drugs used for bipolar disorder (including mood-stabilizers, antipsychotic medications, and even antidepressants) were originally tested in adults, and only a few have been well-studied in children and adolescents. Some children are more prone to side effects from some of these drugs, such as weight gain and changes in blood sugar and cholesterol caused by some atypical antipsychotics. Ask your child's health care provider what symptoms to watch for and you may need to routinely monitor bloodwork. The FDA has issued a warning that using some types of antidepressants or other medicines used to treat depression may increase the risk of suicide in children, adolescents and young adults up to 24 years old. Talk to your child's teachers. In some cases, a child with bipolar disorder may need special allowances at school. They\xa0may need extra breaks or less homework during difficult times. So work out an agreement with your child's teachers or the school principal. In some cases, you may need to take your child out of school for a while, at least until their bipolar symptoms stabilize. Keep a routine. Children with bipolar disorder can really benefit from a daily schedule. Help them get up, eat meals, exercise, and go to bed at roughly the same times each day. Do what you can to reduce stress in the household. Consider family therapy. Having a child with bipolar disorder can be disruptive to the whole family. It can put extra stress on your marriage. Your other children may not understand what's wrong with their sibling, or they may be resentful of all the attention they are getting. Going to family therapy can help you all recognize and deal with these issues. Take suicidal threats seriously. No parent wants to think about their children hurting themselves. But unfortunately, it can happen, even with young children. So if your child begins to express a desire to die, or engages in life-threatening behavior, don't ignore it. Remove any weapons or dangerous drugs from the house. And get help right away."", 'Teenagers With Bipolar Disorder In older teenagers, the symptoms and treatment of bipolar disorder are much more similar to those seen in adults. But having a teenager with this condition presents a lot of distinct problems.', ""As they get older, teenagers might be resentful if they feel that you're imposing treatment on them. So let them into the conversation. Talk frankly -- along with your child's doctor or therapist -- about treatment options. Try not to develop an adversarial relationship with your child over their\xa0treatment or medication. As with adults, it's key that teenagers with bipolar disorder avoid alcohol and drugs, which can interact with medications or bring on or worsen mood episodes. The risks of developing a substance abuse problem are much higher in teens with bipolar disorder than in their peers. It's also important to maintain regular routines around sleep and wake times, and to develop effective coping strategies for managing stress and distress.""]"
19,Bipolar Disorder,"['What Is Bipolar Disorder? Bipolar disorder , also known as manic depression , is a mental illness that brings severe high and low moods and changes in sleep , energy, thinking, and behavior. People who have bipolar disorder can have periods in which they feel overly happy and energized and other periods of feeling very sad, hopeless, and sluggish. In between those periods, they usually feel normal. You can think of the highs and the lows as two ""poles"" of mood, which is why it\'s called ""bipolar"" disorder. The word ""manic"" describes the times when someone with bipolar disorder feels overly excited and confident. These feelings can also involve irritability and impulsive or reckless decision-making. About half of people during mania can also have delusions (believing things that aren\'t true and that they can\'t be talked out of) or hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that aren\'t there). "" Hypomania "" describes milder symptoms of mania, in which someone does not have delusions or hallucinations, and their high symptoms do not interfere with their everyday life.', 'The word ""depressive"" describes the times when the person feels very sad or depressed. Those symptoms are the same as those described in major depressive disorder or ""clinical depression ,"" a condition in which someone never has manic or hypomanic episodes. Most people with bipolar disorder spend more time with depressive symptoms than manic or hypomanic symptoms.', 'Are There Different Types of Bipolar Disorder? There are a few types of bipolar disorder, including: Bipolar I disorder: With this type, you have extreme erratic behavior, with manic “up” periods that last at least a week or are so severe that you need medical care. There are also usually extreme “down” periods that last at least 2 weeks. Bipolar II disorder: With this type, you also have erratic highs and lows, but it isn’t as extreme as bipolar I. Cyclothymic disorder: This type involves periods of manic and depressive behavior that last at least 2 years in adults or 1 year in children and teens. The symptoms aren’t as intense as bipolar disorder I or bipolar disorder II. ""Unspecified"" or ""other specified"" bipolar disorder (formerly called ""bipolar disorder not otherwise specified"") is now used to describe conditions in which a person has only a few of the mood and energy symptoms that define a manic or hypomanic episode, or the symptoms may not last long enough to be considered as clear-cut ""episodes.""', 'Rapid cycling is not a type of bipolar disorder, but a term used to describe the course of illness in people with bipolar I or II disorder. It applies when mood episodes occur four or more times over a 1-year period. Women are more likely to have this type of illness course than men, and it can come and go at any time in the course of bipolar disorder. Rapid cycling is driven largely by depression and carries an increased risk for suicidal thoughts or behaviors. With any type of bipolar disorder, misuse of drugs and alcohol use can lead to more episodes. Having bipolar disorder and alcohol use disorder, known as “dual diagnosis,” requires help from a specialist who can address both issues.', 'What Are the Symptoms of Bipolar Disorder? In bipolar disorder, the dramatic episodes of high and low moods do not follow a set pattern. Someone may feel the same mood state (depressed or manic) several times before switching to the opposite mood. These episodes can happen over a period of weeks, months, and sometimes even years.', 'How severe it gets differs from person to person and can also change over time, becoming more or less severe. Symptoms of mania (""the highs""): Excessive happiness, hopefulness, and excitement Sudden changes from being joyful to being irritable, angry, and hostile Restlessness Rapid speech and poor concentration Increased energy and less need for sleep Unusually high sex drive Making grand and unrealistic plans Showing poor judgment Drug and alcohol abuse Becoming more impulsive Less need for sleep Less of an appetite Larger sense of self-confidence and well-being Being easily distracted During depressive periods (""the lows""), a person with bipolar disorder may have: Sadness Loss of energy Feelings of hopelessness or worthlessness Not enjoying things they once liked Trouble concentrating Forgetfulness Talking slowly Less of a sex drive Inability to feel pleasure Uncontrollable crying Trouble making decisions Irritability Needing more sleep Insomnia Appetite changes that make you lose or gain weight Thoughts of death or suicide Attempting suicide', 'What Are the Causes of Bipolar Disorder? There is no single cause of bipolar disorder. Researchers are studying how a few factors may lead to it in some people. For example, sometimes it can simply be a matter of genetics, meaning you have it because it runs in your family. The way your brain develops may also play a role, but scientists aren’t exactly sure how or why.', 'What Are Bipolar Disorder Risk Factors? When someone develops bipolar disorder, it usually starts when they\'re in late adolescence or young adulthood. Rarely, it can happen earlier in childhood. Bipolar disorder can run in families. Men and women are equally likely to get it. Women are somewhat more likely than men to go through ""rapid cycling,"" which is having four or more distinct mood episodes within a year. Women also tend to spend more time depressed than men with bipolar disorder. Bipolar disorder usually develops later in life for women, and they’re more likely to have bipolar disorder II and be affected by seasonal mood changes.', 'A combination of medical and mental issues is also more common in women. Those medical issues can include thyroid disease, migraine, and anxiety disorders. Some things that make you more likely to have bipolar disorder include: Having a family member with bipolar disorder Going through a time of high stress or trauma Drug or alcohol abuse Certain health conditions Many people with the condition abuse alcohol or other drugs when manic or depressed. People with bipolar disorder are more likely to have seasonal depression, co-existing anxiety disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder.', ""How Is Bipolar Disorder Diagnosed? If you or someone you know has symptoms of bipolar disorder , talk to your family doctor or a psychiatrist . They will ask questions about mental illnesses that you, or the person you're concerned about, have had, and any mental illnesses that run in the family. The person will also get a complete psychiatric evaluation to tell if they have likely bipolar disorder or another mental health condition. Diagnosing bipolar disorder is all about the person's symptoms and determining whether they may be the result of another cause (such as low thyroid or mood symptoms caused by drug or alcohol abuse). How severe are they? How long have they lasted? How often do they happen?"", 'The most telling symptoms are those that involve highs or lows in mood, along with changes in sleep, energy, thinking, and behavior. Talking to close friends and family of the person can often help the doctor distinguish bipolar disorder from major depressive disorder or other psychiatric disorders that can involve changes in mood, thinking, and behavior. If you have just been diagnosed with bipolar disorder , you might feel frightened. The future may seem terribly uncertain. What will this mean for your life, your family, and your job? But getting an accurate diagnosis is actually good news. It means you can finally get the treatment you need. People with bipolar disorder usually go about 10 years before being accurately diagnosed. Diagnosing bipolar disorder can be trickier for children and teenagers. Their symptoms may be the same as adults but might be confused for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or even just bad behavior. If you think your child might have bipolar disorder, ask your doctor for a referral to a child psychologist who’s familiar with bipolar disorder.', ""What Are the Treatments for Bipolar Disorder? Bipolar disorder can be treated. It's a long-term condition that needs ongoing care. People who have four or more mood episodes in a year, or who also have drug or alcohol problems, can have forms of the illness that are much harder to treat. Treatment can make a huge difference. With a combination of things -- good medical care, medication , talk therapy, lifestyle changes, and the support of friends and family -- you can feel better. Bipolar disorder -- or manic depression , as it is also still sometimes called -- has no known\xa0 cure. It is a chronic health condition that requires lifetime management.\xa0 Plenty of people with this condition do well; they have families and jobs and live normal lives. Medication Medication is the main treatment, usually involving the following: Mood stabilizers, such as carbamazepine ( Tegretol ), lamotrigine ( Lamictal ), lithium , or valproate ( Depakote ) Antipsychotic drugs, such as cariprazine ( Vraylar ), lumateperone ( Caplyta ), lurasidone ( Latuda ), olanzapine ( Zyprexa ), and quetiapine ( Seroquel ) Antidepressants Antidepressant-antipsychotic drugs, a combination of an antidepressant and a mood stabilizer Anti-anxiety medications or sleep medicines, such as sedatives like benzodiazepines"", 'It can take a while to find the right combination for you. You may need to try a few things before you and your doctor figure out what works best. Once you do, it’s important to stay on your medication and talk with your doctor before stopping or changing anything. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should talk with their doctors about medications that are safe to take. Psychotherapy , or ""talk therapy,"" is often recommended, too. There are several different types. Options can include: I nterpersonal and social rhythm therapy (IPSRT). This is based on the idea that having a daily routine for everything, from sleeping to eating, can help keep your mood stable. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). This helps you replace bad habits and actions with more positive alternatives. It also can help you learn to manage stress and other negative triggers. Psychoeducation. Learning more and teaching family members about bipolar disorder can help give you support when episodes happen. Family-focused therapy. This sets up a support system to help with treatment and helps your loved ones recognize the beginning of an episode.', 'Other treatment options for bipolar disorder can include: Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Small doses of electricity shock the brain and set off a small seizure to kind of reboot it and change the balance of certain chemicals. While it’s still a last-resort treatment when medications and therapy haven’t worked, it is much better controlled and safer, with fewer risks and side effects, than in the early days of this procedure. Acupuncture. There’s some evidence that\xa0 this complementary therapy may help with the depression caused by bipolar disorder. Supplements. While some people take certain vitamin supplements to help with the symptoms of bipolar disorder, there are many possible issues with using them. For example,\xa0 their ingredients aren’t regulated, they can have side effects, and some can affect how prescribed medications work. Be sure to tell your doctor about any supplements you take. Lifestyle changes may also help: Get regular exercise. Stay on a schedule for eating and sleeping. Learn to recognize your mood swings. Get support from friends or groups. Keep a symptom journal or chart. Learn to manage stress. Find healthy hobbies or sports. Don’t drink alcohol or use recreational drugs.', ""Bipolar Disorder Outlook Bipolar disorder can make you feel utterly alone. But that really isn't the case. More than 2 million adults in the U.S. are coping with bipolar disorder right now. It's important not to blame yourself for your condition. Bipolar disorder is a physical illness, not a sign of personal weakness . It's like diabetes , heart disease , or any other health condition. Nobody knows what causes bipolar disorder, but for many people, it is a very manageable condition. The important thing is to focus on the future. Living with bipolar disorder can be tough. But don't let it hijack your life. Instead, take action and regain control of your health. With dedication and the help of your health care providers, you can feel better again. For most people, a good treatment program can stabilize their moods and help ease symptoms. Those who also have a substance abuse problem may need more specialized treatment. Ongoing treatment is more effective than dealing with problems as they come up. The more you know about your condition, the better you can manage your episodes.

20,Pain Management: Treatment Overview,"['What Are the Treatments for Chronic Pain? The treatments for chronic pain are as diverse as the causes. From over-the-counter and prescription drugs to mind/body techniques to acupuncture, there are a lot of approaches. But when it comes to treating chronic pain, no single technique is guaranteed to produce complete pain relief. Relief may be found by using a combination of treatment options.', 'Drug Therapy: Nonprescription and Prescription Milder forms of pain may be relieved by over-the-counter medications such as Tylenol (acetaminophen) or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen. Both acetaminophen and NSAIDs relieve pain caused by muscle aches and stiffness, and additionally NSAIDs reduce inflammation (swelling and irritation). Topical pain relievers are also available, such as creams, lotions, or sprays that are applied to the skin in order to relieve pain and inflammation from sore muscles and arthritis. If over-the-counter drugs do not provide relief, your doctor may prescribe stronger medications, such as muscle relaxants, anti-anxiety drugs (such as diazepam [Valium]), antidepressants (like duloxetine [Cymbalta] for musculoskeletal pain), prescription NSAIDs such as celecoxib (Celebrex), or a short course of stronger painkillers (such as codeine, fentanyl [Duragesic, Actiq], oxycodone and acetaminophen (Percocet, Roxicet, Tylox) or hydrocodone and acetaminophen (Lorcet, Lortab, and Vicodin). A limited number of steroid injections at the site of a joint problem can reduce swelling and inflammation. An epidural might be given for spinal stenosis or lower back pain.', 'In July 2015, the FDA asked that both prescription and over-the-counter NSAIDs strengthen their warning labels to indicate the potential risk of heart attacks and strokes. The risk increases with higher doses of the drugs. In addition, there is also the possibility of developing bleeding stomach ulcers. Sometimes, a group of nerves that causes pain to a specific organ or body region can be blocked with local medication. The injection of this nerve-numbing substance is called a nerve block. Although many kinds of nerve blocks exist, this treatment cannot always be used. Often blocks are not possible, are too dangerous, or are not the best treatment for the problem. You doctor can advise you as to whether this treatment is appropriate for you. Patient-controlled analgesia ( PCA ) is another method of pain control. By pushing a button on a computerized pump, the patient is able to self-administer a premeasured dose of pain medicine infused with opioids. The pump is connected to a small tube that allows medicine to be injected intravenously (into a vein), subcutaneously (just under the skin), or into the spinal area. This is often used in the hospital to treat pain in\xa0post-traumatic or post-surgical pain as well as terminal cancer pain..', 'Trigger Point Injections Trigger point injection is a procedure used to treat painful areas of muscle that contain trigger points, or knots of muscle that form when muscles do not relax. During this procedure, a healthcare professional, using a small needle, injects a local anesthetic that sometimes includes a steroid into a trigger point (sterile salt water is sometimes injected). With the injection, the trigger point is made inactive and the pain is alleviated. Usually, a brief course of treatment will result in sustained relief. Trigger point injection is used to treat muscle pain in the arms, legs, lower back, and neck. In addition, this approach has been used to treat fibromyalgia, tension headaches, and myofascial pain syndrome (chronic pain involving tissue that surrounds muscle) that does not respond to other treatment. Onabotulinumtoxina\xa0(Botox) is a toxin that blocks signals from the nerves to the muscles. It can also be injected to alleviate chronic migraine headaches . The procedure involves multiple injections around the head and neck every 12 weeks and may alleviate pain for up to three months.', ""Surgical Implants When standard medicines and physical therapy fail to offer adequate pain relief, you may be a candidate for a surgical implant to help you control pain. When they are used, which is rare,\xa0there are two main types of implants to control pain: Intrathecal Drug Delivery. Also called infusion pain pumps or spinal drug delivery systems. The surgeon makes a pocket under the skin that's large enough to hold a medicine pump. The pump is usually about one inch thick and three inches wide. The surgeon also inserts a catheter, which carries pain medicine from the pump to the intrathecal space around the spinal cord. The implants deliver medicines such as morphine or a muscle relaxant directly to the spinal cord , where pain signals travel. For this reason, intrathecal drug delivery can provide significant pain control with a fraction of the dose that would be required with pills. In addition, the system can cause fewer side effects than oral medications because less medicine is required to control pain. Spinal Cord Stimulation Implants. In spinal cord stimulation , low-level electrical signals are transmitted to the spinal cord or to specific nerves to block pain signals from reaching the brain. This method being especially used for back and limb pain. In this procedure, a device that delivers the electrical signals is surgically implanted in the body. A remote control is used by the patient to turn the current off and on or to adjust the intensity of the signals. Some devices cause what’s described as a pleasant, tingling sensation while others do not. Two kinds of spinal cord stimulation systems are available. Partial and totally implanted units. The unit that is more commonly used is fully implanted. The latter system's antenna and transmitter are carried outside the body, while the receiver is implanted inside the body"", 'TENS Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation therapy, more commonly referred to as TENS , uses electrical stimulation to diminish pain. During the procedure, low-voltage electrical current is delivered through electrodes that are placed on the skin near the source of pain. The electricity from the electrodes stimulates the nerves in an affected area and sends signals to the brain that ""scramble"" normal pain signals. TENS is not painful and may be effective therapy to mask pain such as diabetic neuropathy. However, TENS for chronic low back pain is not effective and cannot be recommended, says the American Academy of Neurology (AAN).', 'Bioelectric Therapy Bioelectric therapy relieves pain by blocking pain messages to the brain. Bioelectric therapy also prompts the body to produce chemicals called endorphins (endorphins are also\xa0released by exercise) that decrease or eliminate painful sensations by blocking the message of pain from being delivered to the brain. Bioelectric therapy can be used to treat many chronic and acute conditions causing pain, such as back pain, muscle pain, headaches and migraines, arthritis, TMJ disorder , diabetic neuropathy, and scleroderma. Bioelectric therapy is effective in providing temporary pain control, but it should be used as part of a total pain management program. When used along with conventional pain-relieving medications, bioelectric treatment may allow pain sufferers to reduce their dose of some pain relievers by up to 50%.', 'Physical Therapy Physical therapy helps to relieve pain by using special techniques that improve movement and function impaired by an injury or disability. Along with employing stretching, strengthening, and pain-relieving techniques, a physical therapist may use, among other things, TENS to aid treatment.', ""Exercise Although resting for short periods can alleviate pain, too much rest may actually increase pain and put you at greater risk of injury when you again attempt movement. Research has shown that regular exercise can diminish pain in the long term by improving muscle tone, strength, and flexibility. Exercise may also cause a release of endorphins, the body's natural painkillers. Some exercises are easier for certain chronic pain sufferers to perform than others; try swimming, biking, walking, rowing, and yoga ."", 'Psychological Treatment When you are in pain, you may have feelings of anger, sadness, hopelessness, and/or despair. Pain can alter your personality, disrupt your sleep, and interfere with your work and relationships. In turn, depression and anxiety, lack of sleep, and feelings of stress can all make pain worse. Psychological treatment provides safe, nondrug methods that can treat your pain directly by reducing high levels of physiological stress that often aggravate pain. Psychological treatment also helps improve the indirect consequences of pain by helping you learn how to cope with the many problems associated with pain. A large part of psychological treatment for pain is education, helping patients acquire skills to manage a very difficult problem.', 'Alternative Therapies In the past decade, many people have found relief for their pain in mind-body therapies, acupuncture, and some nutritional supplements. Others use massage , chiropractic and osteopathic (bone) manipulation therapies, therapeutic touch, certain herbal therapies, and dietary approaches to alleviate pain. However, there is little if any scientific evidence supporting these therapies for pain relief.', ""Mind-Body Therapies Mind-body therapies are treatments that are meant to help the mind's ability to affect the functions and symptoms of the body. Mind-body therapies use various approaches including relaxation techniques, meditation, guided imagery, biofeedback, and hypnosis. Relaxation techniques can help alleviate discomfort related to chronic pain . Visualization may be another worthwhile pain-controlling technique. Try the following exercise: Close your eyes and try to call up a visual image of the pain, giving it shape, color, size, motion. Now try slowly altering this image, replacing it with a more harmonious, pleasing -- and smaller -- image. Another approach is to keep a diary of your pain episodes and the causative and corrective factors surrounding them. Review your diary regularly to explore avenues of possible change. Strive to view pain as part of life, not all of it."", 'Electromyographic (EMG) biofeedback may alert you to the ways in which muscle tension is contributing to your pain and help you learn to control it. Hypnotherapy and self-hypnosis may help you block or transform pain through refocusing techniques. One self-hypnosis strategy, known as glove anesthesia, involves putting yourself in a trance, placing a hand over the painful area, imagining that the hand is relaxed, heavy, and numb, and envisioning these sensations as replacing other, painful feelings in the affected area. Relaxation techniques such as meditation or yoga have been shown to reduce stress-related pain when they are practiced regularly. The gentle stretching of yoga is particularly good for strengthening muscles without putting additional strain on the body.', 'Acupuncture Acupuncture is thought to decrease pain by increasing the release of endorphins, chemicals that block pain. Many acu-points are near nerves. When stimulated, these nerves cause a dull ache or feeling of fullness in the muscle. The stimulated muscle sends a message to the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord), causing the release of endorphins that block the message of pain from being delivered to the brain. Acupuncture may be useful as an accompanying treatment for many pain-related conditions, including headache, low back pain, menstrual cramps, carpal tunnel syndrome, tennis elbow, fibromyalgia , osteoarthritis (especially of the knee), and myofascial pain. Acupuncture also may be an acceptable alternative to or may be included as part of a comprehensive pain management program.', 'Chiropractic Treatment and Massage Chiropractic treatment is the most common nonsurgical treatment for back pain. Improvements of people undergoing chiropractic manipulations were noted in some trials. However, the treatment\'s effectiveness in treating chronic back and neck pain has not been supported by compelling evidence from the majority of clinical trials. Further studies are currently assessing the effectiveness of chiropractic care for pain management. Osteopathic doctors, those with a ""D.O."" after their names, are also trained in bone manipulation techniques similar to that of chiropractors . Massage is being increasingly used by people suffering from pain, mostly to manage chronic back and neck problems. Massage can reduce stress and relieve tension by enhancing blood flow. This treatment also can reduce the presence of substances that may generate and sustain pain. Available data suggest that massage therapy, like chiropractic manipulations, holds considerable promise for managing back pain . However, it is not possible to draw final conclusions regarding the effectiveness of massage to treat pain because of the shortcomings of available studies.', 'Therapeutic Touch and Reiki Healing Therapeutic touch and reiki healing are thought to help activate the self-healing processes of an individual and therefore reduce pain. Although these so-called ""energy-based"" techniques do not require actual physical contact, they do involve close physical proximity between practitioner and patient. In the past few years, several reviews evaluated published studies on the efficacy of these healing approaches to ease pain and anxiety and improve health. Although several studies showed beneficial effects with no significant adverse side effects, the limitations of some of these studies make it difficult to draw definitive conclusions. Further studies are needed before these approaches for pain treatment can be recommended.', 'Nutritional Supplements Dietary supplements, such as fish oils and SAMe, also show some evidence of benefit, although more research is needed.', 'Herbal Remedies It has been difficult to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of herbs, though there are a few, such as white willow bark, devil’s claw, cat’s claw, ginger , and turmeric, that have some evidence supporting their use. If you decide to use herbal preparations to better manage your pain, tell your doctor: Some herbs may interact with drugs you are receiving for pain or other conditions and may harm your health.', 'Dietary Approaches to Treating Pain Some people believe that changing dietary fat intake and/or eating plant foods that contain anti-inflammatory agents can help ease pain by limiting inflammation. A mostly raw vegetarian diet was found helpful for some people with fibromyalgia, but this study was not methodologically strong. One study of women with premenstrual symptoms suggested that a low-fat vegetarian diet was associated with decreased pain intensity and duration. Weight loss achieved by a combination of dietary changes and increased physical activity has been shown to be helpful for people suffering from osteoarthritis . Still, further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of dietary modifications as a pain treatment.', 'Things to Consider Alternative therapies are not always benign. As mentioned, some herbal therapies can interact with other medications you may be taking. Always talk to your doctor before trying an alternative approach and be sure to tell all your doctors what alternative treatments you are using.', 'Other Options: Pain Clinics Many people suffering from chronic pain are able to gain some measure of control over it by trying many of the above treatments on their own. But for some, no matter what treatment approach they try, they still suffer from debilitating pain. For them, pain clinics -- special care centers devoted exclusively to dealing with intractable pain -- may be the answer. Some pain clinics are associated with hospitals and others are private; in either case, both inpatient and outpatient treatment are usually available.', 'Pain clinics generally employ a multidisciplinary approach, involving physicians, psychologists , and physical therapists. The patient as well should take an active role in their own treatment. The aim in many cases is not only to alleviate pain but also to teach the chronic sufferer how to come to terms with pain and function in spite of it. Various studies have shown as much as 50% improvement in pain reduction for chronic pain sufferers after visiting a pain clinic, and most people learn to cope better and can resume normal activities.']"
21,Meralgia Paresthetica,"['What Is Meralgia Paresthetica? Meralgia paresthetica is a condition that causes numbness, pain , or a burning feeling in your outer thigh. You might also hear it called Bernhardt-Roth syndrome. It happens when there’s too much pressure on or damage to one of the nerves in your leg, specifically the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (LFCN). In most cases, there are simple ways to treat the condition, such as wearing looser clothing. Some people with more severe meralgia paresthetica may need medication or surgery. With the right treatment and enough time to recover, you can ease your symptoms and feel better.', 'Meralgia Paresthetica Symptoms Usually, you’ll notice the warning signs of meralgia paresthetica only on one side of your body. You might feel: Pain, tingling, numbness, or burning in the outside of your thigh Sensitivity to light touch rather than to firm pressure High sensitivity to heat Pain may be worse after you’ve been walking or standing for a time Your symptoms may be mild at first, but as the condition gets worse, you might feel sharper, shooting pain. It may go away and come back for no clear reason.', 'Meralgia Paresthetica Causes and Risk Factors Nerves travel throughout your body, carrying messages to and from your brain . A certain set of nerves, called the sensory nerves, gather and send signals to your brain about your skin , muscles, and other tissues. If you have meralgia paresthetica, a large sensory nerve in your outer thigh doesn’t have enough room to pass through your hip bone or joints. This may be due to swelling, trauma, or increased pressure in this area. A lot of things can squeeze or damage the nerve, including: Weight gain and obesity Tight clothing, including pants, stockings, a belt, or girdle Pregnancy Injury, such as trauma from a seatbelt during a car crash Something heavy worn around your waist, like a tool or gun belt A disease that can damage the nerves, like diabetes Repetitive motions that could irritate the nerve, such as certain leg movements Standing or walking for a long time Your risk of getting the condition is higher if you: Are overweight Are pregnant Have certain medical conditions, including diabetes, hypothyroidism , and alcoholism Are between ages 30 and 60 Have been exposed to lead-based paint Have legs that are different lengths', 'Meralgia Paresthetica Diagnosis Your doctor will give you a physical exam and ask about your symptoms and your medical history -- especially about any recent injuries or surgeries. The doctor will touch your leg to find the affected area. They\xa0will check for any neurological abnormalities of the lower leg. You may get certain medical tests: Imaging tests. Your doctor may order pictures of the inside of your hip and pelvic area to look for other problems that could be causing your symptoms. You may get x-rays, a CT scan , or an MRI . Electromyography . This measures the electrical activity in your muscles through a thin needle electrode. If you have meralgia paresthetica, the results will be normal. But it can reveal another cause of your pain. Nerve conduction test. Electrode patches applied to your skin put out a small electrical impulse to see how well your nerve sends messages to the muscles. Nerve blockade. Anesthesia is injected into your thigh at the point where your LFCN is likely to be compressed. If you have meralgia paresthetica, the pain will temporarily go away. Blood tests. Your doctor may check for signs of diabetes , hormone or vitamin imbalances, anemia or lead exposure. It can be hard to tell the difference between meralgia paresthetica and other back, hip, or groin conditions. Be patient as you work with your doctor to find the right diagnosis.', 'Meralgia Paresthetica Treatment The goal of treatment is to ease the pressure on your nerve. The type of therapy you get depends on the cause of your condition. Lifestyle changes and home care For mild cases, your doctor may recommend: Heat, ice, or taking over-the-counter pain relievers like aspirin, acetaminophen , naproxen, or ibuprofen for a few days Weight loss Wearing loose-fitting clothing, especially around your upper front hip Physical therapy You may work with a physical therapist on stretching and strengthening exercises for your leg muscles or abs. They may also try phonophoresis, which uses ultrasound to help your body absorb a medication through your skin, or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), which delivers electrical impulses through pads applied to your skin to block pain.', 'Medications If your condition is more severe, you may need: A corticosteroid shot to reduce swelling. Tricyclic antidepressants, which can help relieve nerve pain . Anti-seizure medications including gabapentin, phenytoin or pregabalin , which also work against nerve pain.', 'Your doctor may recommend surgery to ease pressure on the nerve if no other treatment helps. It can take some time for your pain to go away. Some people will still feel numbness even after treatment. In most cases, though, you should be able to recover within 4 to 6 weeks.']"
22,Metastatic Melanoma,"[""What Is Metastatic Melanoma? Melanoma is a type of skin cancer . When it spreads to other places in your body, it's called metastatic, or advanced. You may also hear your doctor refer to it as stage IV melanoma . Melanoma often spreads to: Tissue under the skin Lymph nodes Lungs Liver Brain Malignant melanoma is the most serious skin cancer and can spread to other places in your body and cause death. Melanomas start as changes to an existing mole. The shape becomes asymmetrical, and the color becomes uneven. It may start to grow and become hard or lumpy. They are aggressive and should be surgically removed. Melanomas occur in the cells (melanocytes) that produce the melanin which gives skin its color. The main cause of melanoma is exposure to ultraviolet radiation in sunlight. Although in many cases metastatic melanoma can’t be cured, treatments and support can help you live longer and better. Doctors have\xa0therapies that have greatly increased survival rates. And researchers are working to find new medications that can do even more. Remember: You still have control over the decisions you make about your treatment and your life. It's important to have people you can talk to about your plans, your fears, and your feelings. So find support and learn about your treatment options. That will help you make the most of your life."", 'Causes In most cases, melanoma is caused by exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun or tanning beds. It damages the DNA of your skin cells, and they start to grow out of control.', ""You can get the disease on parts of your body that don't get sunlight, though, like the palms of your hands and the retinas of your eyes . You're more likely to get melanoma if you have: Fair skin, along with lighter hair and eye color Many moles or irregular moles A family history of melanoma"", ""Symptoms If your melanoma has spread to other areas, you may have: Hardened lumps under your skin Swollen or painful lymph nodes Trouble breathing , or a cough that doesn't go away Swelling of your liver (under your lower right ribs) or loss of appetite Bone pain or, less often, broken bones Headaches, seizures , or weakness or numbness in your arms or legs Weight loss Fatigue"", 'Getting a Diagnosis Before you have any tests, your doctor will want to know: Why did you come in? What have you noticed, and when? How are you feeling? Have you been diagnosed with melanoma before? If so, how was it treated? Has anyone in your family had melanoma? Have you ever used a tanning bed? How many times have you had a sunburn ? Do you wear sunscreen ? When? And what type?', ""If you haven’t already been diagnosed with melanoma, your doctor will do a skin exam. If they think\xa0you may have skin cancer, you'll need a biopsy to find out. You usually get one of three types: Punch biopsy. This removes a round piece of skin. Excisional biopsy. Your doctor takes out the entire growth. Shave biopsy. Your doctor tries to shave off the entire growth. A doctor will look at the growth under a microscope to see how thick it is. Usually, a thicker tumor means there is a higher risk the cancer will spread. If you've been diagnosed with melanoma, you may also have a blood test and an imaging test to see if it has spread to other areas. There are different types of imaging tests: Chest X-ray. This uses radiation in low doses to make pictures of the inside of your body. CT scan (computerized tomography). It uses powerful X-rays so your doctor can get a detailed look at what's going on inside you. MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ). It uses powerful magnets and radio waves to make pictures of organs and structures inside your body. It helps show blood flow and can help locate cancer growths. PET scan . This test uses radioactive material to look for signs of cancer ."", ""The doctor will also check to see if your lymph nodes are enlarged. Lymph nodes are bean-sized glands under the skin in your neck, underarms, and groin. The doctor uses a thin needle to remove a sample of cells. This is called a fine-needle aspiration biopsy. The doctor may also do a lymph node biopsy. This removes the lymph nodes most likely to have cancer cells. In this test, the doctor injects a dye into the area where the potential cancer was. It spreads to the nearest lymph nodes, which are removed and tested. If these lymph nodes, called sentinel nodes, don't have cancer, then it's likely the cancer hasn't spread. The results of these tests help the doctor determine the stage of your cancer and how widespread it is. You and your doctor will decide on the best treatment plan once you know that information."", ""Questions for Your Doctor Should I have other tests before we decide on a treatment? What treatments do you recommend? What's involved in these treatments? How will I feel? Will treatments prolong my life? Will treatments improve the quality of my life? Will I have scars? Will I be able to work while I'm having the treatment? What happens if it doesn’t help? Can I take part in clinical trials ? Do you have experience treating metastatic melanoma ?"", ""Treatment Although metastatic melanoma is not easy to treat, you do have options. Choosing what's right for you will depend on where and how big the cancer is, what your health is like, and what your wishes are. Since most cases of metastatic melanoma can't be cured, the goals of treatment are to: Shrink or stop the growth of the disease where it has spread. Stop it from spreading to new areas. Make you more comfortable. Treatment used to be mainly radiation and chemotherapy . Now there are newer drugs available that can work better, studies show. Your treatment may include: Surgery. Your doctor may remove tumors or lymph glands. Although surgery alone probably won't cure the cancer, it can help you live longer and have fewer symptoms. Your doctor will likely also use one or more other treatments. Radiation and chemotherapy . These can help some people, depending on the size and location of the cancer. Immunotherapy. These drugs boost your immune system so it can better attack the cancer. You get immunotherapy through an IV or a shot in high doses. It can have serious side effects, but it can also shrink metastatic melanomas and help some people live longer. These drugs include: Ipilimumab ( Yervoy ): There are two uses for this drug. It can be given to individuals who have had surgery to remove melanoma in order to prevent the melanoma from coming back. It can also be used for late-stage melanoma that cannot be removed by surgery. Ipilimumab is often used in combination with a PD-1 inhibitor. Nivolumab ( Opdivo ), nivolumab- relatlimab-rmbw ( Opdualag ), and pembrolizumab ( Keytruda ) work by inhibiting the PD-1 protein on cells, which enables \xa0the body’s immune system to attack melanoma tumors. Combination therapy with ipilimumab and either nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and\xa0nivolumab-relatlimab-rmbw has been shown to increase overall survival compared to treating with ipilimumab alone. Interferon -alpha and interleukin-2: These older drugs can help some people live longer."", 'Researchers are studying many other drugs that spur the immune system to fight melanoma. Targeted therapy. This kind of treatment aims to kill cancer cells without harming healthy ones. They may work for people who have certain changes in genes. Because these treatments target the tumors, they may cause fewer side effects than chemotherapy or radiation. Some drugs attack a gene called BRAF. About half the people who have melanoma have changes in this gene, which helps cancer cells grow. If you have a tumor with BRAF, these drugs may shrink it and extend your life. They include: Dabrafenib (Tafinlar) Encorafenib (Braftovi) Vemurafenib (Zelboraf) Other drugs block an enzyme called MEK. This enzyme is often overactive in some cancers. These drugs, working in combination with a BRAF inhibitor to attack cancer cells, seem to shrink tumors for a longer period of time: Binimetinib (Mektovi) Cobimetinib ( Cotellic ) Trametinib (Mekinist)', 'Taking Care of Yourself Hearing that your cancer has spread is scary, but a lot of research is underway to find new treatments. And there are treatments available to try to stop the disease from spreading, so you can live longer.', ""It's important to have support and to talk about your fears and feelings, too. Your doctor can help you find a cancer support group. These tips may help you feel better during melanoma treatment: If you lose your appetite, eat small amounts of food every 2 to 3 hours instead of bigger meals. A dietitian can give you other tips on nutrition and eating during your cancer treatment . Ask your doctor for a referral. Exercise can help you feel better overall and fight fatigue . But listen to your body, and balance rest and activity. Get the kind of emotional support that's right for you. It could be from family, friends, your cancer support group, or a religious group."", 'What to Expect Although stage IV melanoma is hard to treat, each case is different, and some people will respond very well to treatment.

23,Understanding Myasthenia Gravis -- the Basics,"[""What Is Myasthenia Gravis? Myasthenia gravis is a chronic condition that causes muscles to tire and weaken easily. For example, if you have myasthenia gravis, you may notice that during a meal, your jaw muscles become tired and weak, interfering with your ability to chew food. After you have rested for a little while, the muscles may become strong again, allowing you to resume eating. This waxing-and-waning weakness of muscles, worsening with use and improving with rest, is a hallmark of this disease. There typically are periods when you may notice more symptoms (called an exacerbation), interspersed with periods when symptoms decrease or disappear (remission). Myasthenia gravis affecting multiple muscle groups throughout the body is called generalized myasthenia gravis. Other common muscle groups that are affected may make it difficult for you to chew, swallow, smile, shrug, lift your arm up, grip, rise to a stand, or walk up stairs. When the muscles needed for breathing are affected, a patient is said to be in myasthenic crisis. This is a life-threatening situation. Though anyone can get myasthenia gravis, those most likely to do so are women between ages 20 and 40 or men between ages 50 and 70. If a woman with myasthenia gravis gives birth, the baby may have some temporary, and potentially life-threatening, muscle weakness (neonatal myasthenia) because of antibodies that have transferred from the mother's bloodstream. Typically, during the baby's first weeks of life, the antibodies are cleared from the baby's circulation and the baby develops normal muscle tone and strength."", 'Myasthenia Gravis Symptoms The disease most commonly affects muscles that control eye and eyelid movement, so the first symptoms you notice may be eyelid drooping and/or blurred or doubled vision. The majority will go on to have weakness in other muscle groups in 1 or 2 years. General symptoms of myasthenia gravis include: Weakness in your eye muscles Drooping eyelids Double vision Blurred vision Change in your facial expression Trouble swallowing Shortness of breath Problems speaking Problems walking and lifting things Trouble holding up your head If the muscles you use to breathe get weak enough that you can’t control them, it’s called a myasthenic crisis. This is a medical emergency that may require a ventilator to help you breathe. Around 15% to 20% of people with myasthenia gravis have at least one myasthenic crisis. They can be caused by an infection, stress, surgery, or a reaction to medication.', 'Myasthenia Gravis Causes Under normal conditions, nerves direct your muscles to work by sending a message through an area called a receptor. The chemical that delivers the message is called acetylcholine. When acetylcholine binds to a nerve receptor, your muscle knows to contract. In myasthenia gravis, your body attacks its acetylcholine receptors.', ""Myasthenia gravis is considered to be an autoimmune disorder. In an autoimmune disease, some of the body's antibodies (special proteins in your body that are supposed to be programmed to fight foreign invaders such as bacteria, viruses, or fungi) mistake a part of your own body as foreign, resulting in its destruction. In the case of myasthenia gravis, antibodies block, attack or destroy the acetylcholine receptors needed for muscle contraction. No one knows exactly what causes the body to begin producing the antibodies that destroy acetylcholine receptors. In some cases, the process seems to be related to the thymus gland, which helps produce antibodies. About 15% of all myasthenia gravis patients are found to have a thymoma, a tumor of the thymus. Although most thymomas are benign (not cancerous), the thymus is usually removed (thymectomy) to prevent the potential spread of cancer. In fact, thymectomy seems to improve symptoms of myasthenia gravis in some patients, even if no tumor is present."", 'Myasthenia Gravis Diagnosis To see if you have myasthenia gravis, your doctor will start with a neurological exam. This includes a test of your: Reflexes Muscle strength Muscle tone Touch Sight Coordination Balance Fatigability (how soon your muscles weaken) Then you’ll have tests to help look more closely at symptoms of myasthenia gravis. These include: Edrophonium test. Your doctor injects you with a chemical called edrophonium chloride to see if it improves your muscle strength. If it does, that’s a sign you might have myasthenia gravis. Ice pack test. If you have a drooping eyelid, your doctor may put an ice pack on it for 2 minutes to see if the low temperature has an effect on it. Blood test. Your doctor will draw some of your blood and send it to a lab to check for certain antibodies that affect muscle nerve receptors. Repetitive nerve stimulation. This test uses electrodes on your muscles to send small electrical pulses to see if your nerves react to the signals. Single-fiber electromyography (EMG). Your doctor puts a thin wire electrode through your skin and into a muscle. It can test the electrical activity between your brain and your muscles. Imaging. Your doctor may suggest a CT scan or MRI to look more closely for a tumor on your thymus that could be causing symptoms. Pulmonary functioning tests. Your doctor tests your breathing to see if your lungs are affected by myasthenia gravis.', 'Myasthenia Gravis Treatment and Home Remedies Your treatment will depend on your age, how severe your symptoms are, and how fast the condition is progressing. You might need one or several treatments together. Your doctor may recommend a medication such as: Cholinesterase inhibitors. These medications boost the communication between your nerves and your muscles. They can help strengthen muscles. Corticosteroids. Corticosteroids such as prednisone mute your immune system and slow the release of antibodies that could be helping block your nerve receptors. Immunosuppressants. Your doctor may add immunosuppressants to your corticosteroids to help reduce your immune system response. Neonatal Fc receptor blocker. It works by blocking the\xa0autoantibodies that cause myasthenia gravis and helps ease the symptoms. If you’re dealing with a sudden worsening of symptoms or will soon have surgery or other therapies, your doctor may recommend intravenous (IV) therapy. Choices for this include: Plasmapheresis. This procedure is like dialysis, because it filters your blood. Your blood goes through a machine that removes certain antibodies. The effects are faster than other treatments but they\xa0are not long lasting (about a month). This procedure is usually used in a crisis. Intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIg ). This therapy injects new antibodies into your bloodstream. These antibodies alter your immune system response to help with symptoms. Results typically last about 3-6 weeks. Monoclonal antibodies. Your doctor will likely recommend this option only if other treatments haven’t worked. They can have serious side effects.', 'If your myasthenia gravis is due to a tumor on your thymus gland, you may need surgery to remove the whole gland (thymectomy). Even if you don’t have a tumor, taking your thymus out may help ease your symptoms. It may take years to see benefits from a thymectomy. You may need open surgery to remove your thymus . A surgeon opens your breastbone to get to your thymus and take it out. Another option that may work is minimally invasive surgery. There are two options: Video-assisted thymectomy. Surgeons make small cuts in your neck or chest and use a long, thin camera called an endoscope along with instruments to take out your thymus. Robot-assisted thymectomy. Surgeons make the same small cuts as video-assisted thymectomy and then use a robot with a camera and mechanical arms to remove your thymus.', 'In addition to medical treatments, you can make lifestyle changes to help manage your myasthenia gravis symptoms, including: Save energy when you eat. If chewing is a struggle, eat at times when you have the most strength. You might find it easier to eat several small meals a day instead of longer, larger ones less often. Stick to soft foods, and take breaks between bites. Install safety aids. Put handrails anywhere you might need a helpful handle, like next to the toilet or near tables. Remove any tripping risks such as rugs or floor clutter. Let machines do the work. Switch to an electric toothbrush and can opener, or any other device that can save you strength. Wear an eye patch. It can help with double vision. Use one when you watch TV or read, and switch eyes from time to time. Plan ahead. Be smart with your strength. Do chores or errands when you feel best during the day.']"
24,Thrombocytopenia (Low Platelet Count),"['What Is Thrombocytopenia? Thrombocytopenia is the condition when you don’t have enough platelets in your blood. Platelets are small blood cells that clot your blood after you get any cut or scrape that bleeds or a bigger injury.These cells stick together, which stops bleeding. You need platelets for your blood to clot. When your platelet counts are low, you may be at risk for bleeding.(Photo credit: Skypixel/Dreamstime) If you\'re wondering what the long name means, here\'s how it breaks down: ""Thrombocytes"" is another name for your platelets, and ""penia"" means you don\'t have enough of something. Put those terms together, and you get ""thrombocytopenia."" A healthy person usually has a platelet count of 150,000 to 450,000 in every microliter of blood. (A single drop of blood has about 35 microliters.) You have low platelets and thrombocytopenia if your lab values fall under 150,000.', ""Thrombocytopenia Symptoms Usually, you won't feel anything when you have thrombocytopenia. The condition often has no symptoms. But when you do have symptoms, they can include: Bleeding. This happens most often from your gums or nose. Thrombocytopenia also can cause heavier or longer periods or breakthrough bleeding if you have a menstrual cycle. You may also see blood in your pee or poop. Blotches and bruises . You might have large areas of bleeding under the skin that don't turn white when you press on them. You also might see what looks like the bruises you get from a bump or after being hit. They could be blue or purple and change to yellow or green over time. These are caused from the inside by the sudden leaking from tiny blood vessels. The medical name for these is purpura. Red, flat spots on your skin. You'll see these spots the size of a pinhead mostly on your legs and feet, and they may appear in clumps. Your doctor may call them petechiae. Petechiae don't turn white when you put pressure on them. Fatigue. Low platelets by itself won't make you feel run down and tired. But other conditions that cause low platelets can leave you feeling fatigued. Enlarged spleen. You'll have this if your spleen is trapping platelets, which may be one reason for your low counts."", ""Thrombocytopenia Causes Thrombocytopenia has many possible causes. Sometimes it runs in families, but it's rare. Low platelet counts are more often related to one of many medical conditions or medicines you take for another condition. If your low platelet counts are caused by another condition, treating the underlying problem may help. In general, anything that makes your body make less platelets than it needs will cause low platelet counts. You also can have low counts if your body is breaking platelets down or using them up faster than it's making new ones. Your platelet counts also can be low if your spleen or another part of your body is trapping platelets more than it should. Conditions or things that can cause your body to make too few platelets include: Leukemia or other cancer types Certain anemias (when your blood doesn't have enough red blood cells) Viral infections, including hepatitis C or HIV Certain medicines or treatments, including chemotherapy or radiation Drinking too much alcohol Toxins, including pesticides or arsenic"", ""Conditions or things that can cause your body to break platelets down too fast include: Pregnancy Autoimmune diseases, including lupus or rheumatoid arthritis Bacterial or viral infections Medicines that make your immune system destroy platelets Certain rare conditions, including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura or hemolytic uremic syndrome Conditions or things that can cause too many of your platelets to get lost or trapped include: Alcohol abuse or alcohol use disorder Bleeding or hemorrhage Pregnancy Liver disease Blood clots in your lungs (pulmonary embolism) High blood pressure in your lungs (pulmonary hypertension) What are the most common low platelet count causes? The most common reason for low platelet counts is another health condition or a medicine you're taking for another health condition. Some other risk factors for low platelets include: Family history Genetics Age"", 'Types of Thrombocytopenia You can have different types of thrombocytopenia depending on what\'s causing your low platelet counts: Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) One of the most common causes of low platelets is a condition called immune thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP). You may hear it called by its old name, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. ""Purpura"" means that your skin looks purple like it\'s bruised. Although doctors don\'t know why ITP happens, the problem is that your immune system isn\'t working right. Your antibodies, which should attack infections, destroy your platelets by mistake.', ""ITP comes in two types: acute and chronic. Acute ITP usually happens in kids after a virus like chickenpox. It comes on fast and goes away in weeks or months. You probably won't need any treatment, and it usually won't come back. Chronic ITP means you'll have it for 6 months or more. Chronic ITP is more common in adults than it is in kids. But teens also can get it. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) TTP doesn't happen a lot, but it's dangerous when it does. When you have TTP, you'll get many blood clots throughout your body. These clots can make your organs not work right or damage them. The reason you'll have low platelet counts in your blood is that they're being used up in all the clots. TTP usually lasts for days, weeks, or even months. Without treatment, it can lead to brain damage, stroke, or death. Drug-induced thrombocytopenia (DIT) Medicines can cause low platelet count. This happens a lot, but doctors don't always realize a drug is why you have low platelet counts. More than 300 drugs can cause low platelets."", ""Usually you'll have this type of thrombocytopenia 1-2 weeks after you start a new drug. But certain drugs may cause it after you take it the first time. If a drug is causing your low platelet count, it usually will go away after you stop taking it. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) This type happens when you take a drug called heparin. Doctors use heparin to protect against blood clots when you're at risk for a dangerous clot due to surgery or another condition. It can happen when the drug makes your platelets clump up instead of staying in your blood. It usually happens 2-3 days after you take heparin the first time. Sometimes your immune system also plays a role. HIT is the most common type of DIT. It happens most often when you're in the hospital. Gestational thrombocytopenia This type is the most common cause of low platelets when you're pregnant. It's not clear why pregnancy causes low platelet counts. It happens most often late in pregnancy. It usually goes away after birth. But if you've had gestational thrombocytopenia with one pregnancy, it may come back if you get pregnant again."", ""Usually this type of thrombocytopenia doesn't lead to bleeding. But your doctor may want to order tests to make sure there isn't some other reason for your low platelet counts. Dilutional thrombocytopenia You can have low platelets after a major blood transfusion to replace more than all the blood you have in 24 hours. It happens when you've lost blood and platelets and then your blood is replaced with lots of red cells. If you have this, a doctor will decide if you need more platelets to get your count back up. Distributional thrombocytopenia This is the name for low platelet counts when your platelets get trapped in your spleen. Your spleen usually will have about 30% of your platelets in it. When your spleen is bigger than it should be, it can have up to 90% of your platelets. Pseudothrombocytopenia This type isn't thrombocytopenia at all. It happens when a problem with a blood test makes it look like your platelets are low when they really aren't. It usually isn't a problem, but it could be if you get more testing or treatment you don't need."", 'Thrombocytopenia Diagnosis Thrombocytopenia is often found by chance when your doctor does a routine blood test. They might ask you questions to find out why your platelet counts are low and what type of thrombocytopenia you have. Some questions your doctor may ask include: What symptoms (including bleeding) have you noticed? When did you first see them? Does anything make them better? Or worse? What medications and supplements are you taking? Have you had any shots in the last month, a blood transfusion, or used drugs with a needle? Does anyone in your family have a problem with their immune system, bleeding, or bruising? What have you eaten recently? Some tests check for low platelet counts or other things that may lead to low platelets: Blood test. A complete blood count (CBC) looks at the amount of red and white blood cells and platelets in your blood. Blood smear . This shows how your platelets look under a microscope. Bone marrow test . Your bone marrow is where new blood cells get made. Your doctor uses a very fine needle to draw a small amount of liquid bone marrow and check it for cells that may not be working right. Or you may get a biopsy, using a different kind of needle, so your doctor can check the types and numbers of cells in the bone marrow. Blood clot test. This test measures how long it takes your blood to clot. It tells you how your platelets are working. Platelet antibody test. This test will see if antibodies in your blood are attacking your platelets. If you have platelet antibodies in your blood, it means your low platelets are caused by ITP. Your doctor may do a physical exam to check you for signs of internal bleeding and feel if your spleen seems big. They may order an abdominal ultrasound to look for changes in your liver, spleen, or lymph nodes. You may also need genetic or other tests to help your doctor figure out why your platelets are low.', ""How Serious Is Thrombocytopenia? For most people, having a low platelet count isn't a big problem. But if you have a severe form, you can bleed even when you aren't hurt in your eyes, gums, or bladder. You also could bleed too much when you’re hurt. You could bleed even with no injury at all.Trombocytopenia can be fatal, especially if you bleed a lot or bleed in your brain. Thrombocytopenia Complications Life-threatening hemorrhage or internal bleeding. You'll get this when you have a platelet lab value under 20,000. When your platelets are this low, it can cause sudden bleeds, including brain hemorrhage, even when you don't have an injury. Strokes. If your blood clots too much despite your low platelets, you may have a stroke. Heart attack. You can have a heart attack if low platelets causes less blood to flow to your heart. If you have low platelets and don't follow your doctors advice, the condition can be life-threatening."", ""Questions for Your Doctor What's causing the problem? Do I need treatment? What are my treatment options? Which do you recommend? Do these treatments have side effects? What can I do about them? How will we know if the treatment is working? When will I start to feel better?

How do I know if my platelets drop at home or I'm bleeding internally?"", ""Thrombocytopenia Treatment There are many treatment options for thrombocytopenia. If it's mild, you might not need any treatment. You'll need to work with your doctor to weigh the pros and cons of each and find a therapy that's right for you. The treatment will depend on what type of thrombocytopenia you have and what's causing it. If your thrombocytopenia is drug-induced, stopping your medicine may help. If you have ITP and the trouble is with your immune system, your treatment depends on how severe a case you have. If it's mild, you may only need to get regular checks of your platelet levels."", ""When you do need treatment, the goal is to get your platelet count up enough to prevent serious bleeding in your gut or brain. You may need a platelet transfusion if there is immediate life-threatening bleeding. You may only get treatment when you have symptoms. But it's possible your doctor could suggest treatment even when you feel fine. That's more likely if you're at high risk for bleeding or other complications. Some treatment options for low platelets include: Blood or platelet transfusions. Your doctor can give you more blood or platelets to replace those you've lost. Medicines. You may need medication for thrombocytopenia if the problem is with your immune system. Steroids or other medicines that target your immune system may help to keep your antibodies from attacking your platelets. Surgery. If other options don't work, your doctor might suggest surgery to take out your spleen (splenectomy). Plasma exchange. If your low platelet counts are from TTP, plasma exchange can filter out the abnormal parts of your blood to help keep you from getting clots."", ""Taking Care of Yourself You can still do most things, but you may need to make some changes to your lifestyle to avoid getting hurt or cut. These include: Avoid activities that make injury likely. Ask your doctor about steps you should take. For instance, it may be best for you to avoid contact sports such as boxing, martial arts, or football. Be thoughtful about which medicines you take. You probably shouldn't take medicines that make bleeding easier, such as aspirin and ibuprofen , or other NSAIDS like naproxen or Aleve . Don't drink too much alcohol. Check with your doctor to see how much it's OK to drink. It's always better to drink in moderation. Alcohol can make your body produce platelets more slowly."", ""What to Expect Your case may be different from someone else's. Your doctor will watch you to see how you're doing.

25,Muscular Dystrophy,"['What Is Muscular Dystrophy? Muscular dystrophy (MD) is a group of inherited diseases in which the muscles that control movement (called voluntary muscles) progressively weaken. In some forms of this disease, the heart and other organs are also affected. There are nine major forms of muscular dystrophy: Myotonic Duchenne Becker Limb-girdle Facioscapulohumeral Congenital Oculopharyngeal Distal Emery-Dreifuss Muscular dystrophy can appear in infancy up to middle age or later, and its form and severity are determined in part by the age at which it occurs. Some types of muscular dystrophy typicallyaffect only males; some people with MD enjoy a normal life span with mild symptoms that progress very slowly; others experience swift and severe muscle weakness and wasting, dying in their late teens to early 20s. The various types of MD affect more than 50,000 Americans. Through advances in medical care, children with muscular dystrophy are living longer than ever before.', ""Muscular Dystrophy Symptoms by Type Myotonic (also called MMD or Steinert's disease). The most common form of muscular dystrophy in adults, myotonic muscular dystrophy affects both men and women, and it usually appears any time from early childhood to adulthood. In rare cases, it appears in newborns (congenital MMD). The name refers to a symptom, myotonia -- prolonged spasm or stiffening of muscles after use. This symptom is usually worse in cold temperatures. The disease causes muscle weakness and also affects the central nervous system , heart , gastrointestinal tract, eyes , and hormone-producing glands. In most cases, daily living isn't restricted for many years. Those with myotonic MD have a decreased life expectancy. Duchenne. The most common form of muscular dystrophy in children, Duchenne muscular dystrophy typically affects only males. It appears between the ages of 2 and 6. The muscles decrease in size and grow weaker over time yet may appear larger. Disease progression varies, but many people with Duchenne (1 in 3,500 boys) need a wheelchair by the age of 12. In most cases, the arms, legs, and spine become progressively deformed, and there may be some cognitive impairment. Severe breathing and heart problems mark the later stages of the disease. Those with Duchenne MD usually die in their late teens or early 20s. Becker. This form is similar to Duchenne muscular dystrophy, but the disease is much milder: symptoms appear later and progress more slowly. It usually appears between the ages of 2 and 16 but can appear as late as age 25. Like Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Becker muscular dystrophy typically affects only males (1 in 30,000) and causes heart problems. Disease severity varies. Those with Becker can usually walk into their 30s and live further into adulthood. Limb-girdle. This appears in the teens to early adulthood and affects males and females. In its most common form, Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy causes progressive weakness that begins in the hips and moves to the shoulders, arms, and legs and the heart may be affected. Within 20 years, walking becomes difficult or impossible. Sufferers typically live to middle age to late adulthood. Facioscapulohumeral. Facioscapulohumeral refers to the muscles that move the face, shoulder blade, and upper arm bone . This form of muscular dystrophy appears in the teens to early adulthood and affects males and females. It progresses slowly, with short periods of rapid muscle deterioration and weakness. Severity ranges from very mild to completely disabling. Walking, chewing, swallowing, and speaking problems can occur. About 50% of those with facioscapulohumeral MD can walk throughout their lives, and most live a normal life span. It may also bee associated with seizures, mental health problems, and can involve the heart Congenital. Congenital means present at birth. Congenital muscular dystrophies progress slowly and affect males and females. The two forms that have been identified -- Fukuyama and congenital muscular dystrophy with myosin deficiency -- cause muscle weakness at birth or in the first few months of life, along with severe and early contractures (shortening or shrinking of muscles that causes joint problems). Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy causes abnormalities in the brain and often seizures . Oculopharyngeal. Oculopharyngeal means eye and throat. This form of muscular dystrophy appears in men and women in their 40s, 50s, and 60s. It progresses slowly, causing weakness in the eye and face muscles, which may lead to difficulty swallowing. Weakness in pelvic and shoulder muscles may occur later. Choking and recurrent pneumonia may occur. Distal. This group of rare diseases affects adult men and women. It causes weakness and wasting of the distal muscles (those farthest from the center) of the forearms, hands, lower legs, and feet . It is generally less severe, progresses more slowly, and affects fewer muscles than other forms of muscular dystrophy. Emery-Dreifuss. This rare form of muscular dystrophy appears from childhood to the early teens and affects mainly males. In very rare cases, females can be affected. For that to happen, both of a girls X chromosomes (the one they get from their mother and the one from their father) would have to have the defective gene. It causes muscle weakness and wasting in the shoulders, upper arms, and lower legs. Life-threatening heart problems are common and can also affect carriers -- those who have the genetic information for the disease but do not develop the full-blown version (including mothers and sisters of those with Emery-Dreifuss MD). Muscle shortening (contractures) occurs early in the disease. Weakness can spread to chest and pelvic muscles. The disease progresses slowly and causes less severe muscle weakness than some other forms of muscular dystrophy."", ""Muscular Dystrophy Causes and Risk Factors Muscular dystrophy is caused by defects in certain genes, with type determined by the abnormal gene. In 1986, researchers discovered the gene that, when defective or flawed, causes Duchenne muscular dystrophy. In 1987, the muscle protein associated with this gene was named dystrophin. Duchenne muscular dystrophy occurs when that gene fails to make dystrophin. Becker muscular dystrophy occurs when a different mutation in the same gene results in some dystrophin, but it's either not enough or it's poor in quality. Scientists have discovered and continue to search for the genetic defects that cause other forms of muscular dystrophy."", ""Most of the muscular dystrophies are a form of inherited disease called X-linked disorders or genetic diseases that mothers can transmit to their sons even though the mothers themselves are unaffected by the disease. Men carry one X chromosome and one Y chromosome. Females carry two X chromosomes. Thus, in order for a girl to become affected by muscular dystrophy, both their X chromosomes would have to carry the defective gene -- an extremely rare occurrence, since their mother would have to be a carrier (one defective X chromosome) and their father would have to have muscular dystrophy (since men carry just one X chromosome, the other is a Y chromosome). A female who carries the defective X chromosome can pass the disease to their son (whose other chromosome is a Y, from the father). A few muscular dystrophies aren't inherited at all and occur because of a new gene abnormality or mutation."", 'Muscular Dystrophy Diagnosis To start, your doctor will examine your child and ask questions about medical and family health history. Muscular dystrophy is diagnosed using several different tests. These may include:', 'Muscle biopsy . A small piece of muscle tissue is removed and examined to confirm the diagnosis or rule out another muscle disease. Genetic ( DNA ) testing. Genes passed down through families can cause some forms of muscular dystrophy. A blood test can determine if you or your child has the gene. Neurological tests. Various tests are done to check nervous system function, reflexes, and coordination. One example is a nerve conduction study, also called a nerve function test, or electromyography (EMG).', 'Enzyme tests. These are blood tests that check for proteins, or enzymes, linked to muscle weakness. People with muscular dystrophy have high levels of the enzyme creatine kinase. It’s made when muscles are damaged. They also have higher levels of serum aldolase, which is made when your body breaks down sugar into energy. Heart monitoring. An electrocardiogram may be done to check for an abnormal heartbeat . Some types of muscular dystrophy cause irregular heartbeats. MRI or ultrasound . These imaging tests give the doctor a look at muscle quality and can reveal if fat is replacing muscle tissue.', 'Muscular Dystrophy Treatment There is no cure for muscular dystrophy, but treatments can help manage symptoms and improve quality of life. Medications Prescription drugs are available to control muscular dystrophy symptoms or slow their progression. Medications for muscular dystrophy include: Steroids . Corticosteroids, such as prednisone and deflazacort (Emflaza), are the standard of care for muscular dystrophy. They help improve muscle strength and breathing and decrease weakness. Side effects include high blood pressure and weight gain . People who use steroids for a long time are at risk for brittle bones. Medicines targeting gene mutations. Eteplirsen (Exondys 51) and golodirsen (Vyondys 53) increase the level of the gene dystrophin. They’re approved to specifically treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Anticonvulsants. Often used to treat epilepsy , these antiseizure drugs may also help reduce muscle spasms . Immunosuppressants. These powerful medicines are often used to treat lupus and other autoimmune diseases . When given to people with muscular dystrophy, they may help prevent some muscle cell damage. Antibiotics. The doctor may prescribe an antibiotic to treat a lung infection, which is common in people with muscular dystrophy.', 'Physical therapy Physical therapy helps keep joints and muscles flexible. It’s an important part of a muscular dystrophy treatment plan. The goal of physical therapy is to improve strength in the large muscle groups and prevent scoliosis and contractures. Physical therapy for muscular dystrophy may involve: Range of motion exercises Stretching Low-impact workouts, such as swimming or water exercise (aquatic therapy)', 'Respiratory care Muscle weakness can affect the lungs, making breathing difficult. A respiratory therapist can teach you and your child how to properly use a mask, nose device, or mouthpiece. Mobility and positioning aids Braces, walkers, or wheelchairs help provide mobility and independence to people with muscular dystrophy. Standing with a walker, even for just a little bit each day, boosts blood flow and helps build better bones. Speech therapy Muscle weakness in the face and throat can make speaking difficult. Learning how to properly pace breathing and talking can be helpful. A speech therapist can also show you how to use speech communication devices.', 'Surgery Surgery may be recommended to manage or correct complications of muscular dystrophy. For example, cataract surgery may be done to replace a cloudy eye lens. Or a person with muscular dystrophy may need spinal fusion surgery to treat scoliosis, or heart surgery to implant a pacemaker .', 'Muscular Dystrophy Complications The complications of muscular dystrophy depend on the type. Some types are mild, while others are serious and get worse very fast. Worsening muscle weakness can affect the ability to walk, breathe, swallow, and speak. Complications of muscular dystrophy can include: Breathing problems . Progressive weakness in the breathing muscles (diaphragm) makes it hard to take a breath. That raises the risk for lung infections such as pneumonia. Curving of the spine (scoliosis). Weakness in the muscles supporting the backbone causes the spine to become curved. Most people with Duchenne muscular dystrophy need scoliosis surgery. Heart problems. Some types of muscular dystrophy cause abnormal and dangerous changes in the heartbeat. You need a pacemaker to regulate it. Muscular dystrophy can also cause the heart muscle to become weak ( cardiomyopathy ). That leads to heart failure .', 'Swallowing difficulty. Weakness affects the muscles in the esophagus , and causes problems with chewing and swallowing. This can lead to choking. Some people with muscular dystrophy will need a feeding tube . Shortening of the tendons or muscles around the joints (contractures). Bracing and tendon release surgery can help prevent some contractures. Vision problems. Some types of muscular dystrophy cause clouding of the eye lens ( cataracts ). Need for a wheelchair. Weakness in the large muscles of the legs makes it difficult to walk, stand, kneel, or climb. Some people with muscular dystrophy eventually need to use a wheelchair.']"
26,Understanding Ear Infections – the Basics,"[""About half of kids get at least one ear infection, also known as acute otitis media , before their second birthday. Here's why this condition is so common, and what you can do to help keep your child healthy."", ""What Causes an Ear Infection? The middle ear is a small space behind your eardrum. It contains tiny bones that vibrate and help you hear. This part of your ear is supposed to be vented by air that passes into your nose and throat and through a passage called the eustachian tube. If anything blocks air from getting through, the middle ear can become damp and warm – a perfect breeding ground for germs. In babies and kids, the eustachian tube is often very soft and has a hard time staying open. Allergies, post-nasal drainage, sinus infections, common cold viruses, and problems with the tonsils can all prevent enough air from passing into the middle ear. If a doctor looks at your child's eardrum and sees that it's red and bulging, they'll diagnose them with an ear infection. Image credit: WebMD"", ""Symptoms of an ear infection Your child may have: Fever Pain in the ear (babies will rub or pull on their ears) Vomiting and diarrhea (in babies only) Trouble hearing Crying or pain when sucking Loss of sleep or appetite The most common trigger of an ear infection in kids is an upper respiratory infection , like a cold or the flu . These viruses can swell the eustachian tube so that air can't flow into the middle ear. Allergies to pollen , dust, animal dander, or food can have the same effect. So can smoke, fumes, and other environmental toxins. Bacteria can cause an ear infection, but usually these germs come after a virus or an allergic reaction . Bacteria can infect an already inflamed ear and cause other symptoms, like a fever . A shot called the conjugate pneumococcal vaccine can help protect your child against some of the most common bacteria that cause ear infections. It's routinely given to babies and toddlers to prevent serious illnesses like meningitis , pneumonia, and blood infections. Keeping your child up to date on this vaccine may help prevent at least some ear infections."", ""Some kids only get an ear infection once, or once in awhile. If so, it's called acute ear infection (or acute otitis media) . If the infection clears up but comes back as many as three times in a 6-month period (or four times in a year), your child may be diagnosed with recurrent acute otitis media . That's often a sign that your child's eustachian tube isn't working well. A t times, fluid can also build up in your child's middle ear without signs of infection. If so, it's called otitis media with effusion . The following can put your child at risk for repeat middle ear infections. Male gender, or being assigned male at birth A family history of ear infections Being bottle-fed formula (Babies who are fed breast milk have fewer ear infections.) Going to a day care center Living in a home with tobacco smokers An issue with their palate, like a cleft palate A weakened immune system or chronic respiratory disease, such as cystic fibrosis and asthma"", ""Treatments and Complications About half the time, an ear infection goes away on its own. No medication is needed . But many kids will need an antibiotic, usually amoxicillin , for 10 days. The drug starts to work within a day or so. Sometimes the fluid in the middle ear doesn't drain, blocking the eardrum and causing temporary hearing loss. This is common. In many cases, another round of amoxicillin or another type of antibiotic will clear it up. Repeat ear infections can be a concern since they're linked to short-term hearing loss . In early childhood, hearing is key to speech development. If your child has severe hearing loss for a long time, learning to speak and understand language may be harder."", 'To Tube or Not to Tube For many years, kids who had repeat ear infections and hearing loss were given ""ear tubes."" During a short surgery called a myringotomy, tiny tubes are put into the ear to keep the middle ear vented. Now, many doctors opt to skip this surgery. Studies show that ear tubes aren\'t always needed. Putting off surgery for up to 9 months likely won\'t hurt your child\'s language skills. If your doctor suggests ear tubes for your child, you might want a second opinion.', 'Danger of Misusing Antibiotics Long before ear tubes are discussed, many doctors prescribe antibiotics . This type of drug can reduce the number of infections your child gets. But they also promote the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (""super"" germs that antibiotics can\'t kill). If your child has fluid in their ear but no sign of infection or fever, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) actually advises against antibiotics. Because of that, your pediatrician may hold off on giving your child antibiotics when they have an ear infection. If they do prescribe this type of medication, make sure that your child finishes all of it. If not, the germs that made them sick may come back.', ""How Can I Prevent an Ear Infection? For starters, remove as many pollutants from your home as you can, including: Dust Cleaning supplies and household products that contain harsh chemicals Tobacco smoke If your child has allergies, ask their doctor for tips to control them. Taking steps to prevent colds , the flu , and other illnesses can prevent some ear infections. To do that: Be sure everyone in your home, including your child, stays up to date on the shots your doctor suggests. That includes flu and pneumococcal vaccines . Make hand-washing a habit that becomes part of your family's routine. If your child goes to day care, look for a center that monitors kids for illness and requests that sick kids stay home, especially during cold and flu season. Breast feed your baby for at least 6 months, if you can. Babies who are formula-fed have a 70% greater risk of ear infections. If you run into issues, talk to your doctor or a lactation consultant (a provider specially trained to help with breastfeeding). If you bottle-feed, hold your baby's head higher than their stomach. This will help keep their eustachian tubes from getting blocked. Avoid group day care during your child's first year, if that's an option. Caring for them in a home setting could cut back on the number of germs they're exposed to. Avoid tobacco smoke. Babies and kids who are around secondhand smoke are at a higher risk for ear infections."", ""What to Do if Your Child Does Get an Ear Infection No matter how hard you try to protect your child, they'll come across germs at some point. To help them through this rough patch: Don't feed your baby while they're lying down. This makes ear pressure and pain worse. Give your child over-the-counter acetaminophen (not aspirin ) to help make them more comfortable. Read the label carefully and follow the dosage advice. Try placing several warm (not hot!) drops of mullein or garlic oil in your child's ear. Both are natural antibiotics. (But check with your pediatrician before placing anything in your child's ear.)""]"

Don't get lactose intolerance confused with a milk allergy . They're not the same thing. Lactose intolerance is when you can't digest lactose, the sugar found in dairy products. You'll often get symptoms like stomach pain , gas, and diarrhea . With a milk allergy , the symptoms affect more than just your digestive tract.

Dairy products are an important source of calcium , protein, and vitamins D and B12. If you or your child has a milk allergy, foods such as broccoli, spinach, and soy products can help fill the void. A registered dietitian can help you develop a well-balanced eating plan. Try dairy substitutes. Drink soy, rice, oat, \xa0and almond milks that are fortified with calcium and vitamin D . Look for non-dairy ice cream, chocolate , cheese, and yogurt. Use margarines made with vegetable oil instead of butter. A tablespoon of vinegar in a cup of rice milk or soy milk works as a buttermilk substitute. Be careful with kosher products. Some may contain milk protein, even those labeled ""pareve,"" which are considered milk-free under kosher guidelines. Stay away from foods without labels, like from salad bars, deli counters, and bakeries. They\'re more likely to accidentally have your allergy triggers in them. Always read labels, even on things that you buy every week. Food companies change ingredients all the time. Just because something has been safe for you in the past doesn\'t mean it always will be. Ask your pediatrician about safe formula. If you have a baby with a milk allergy , the doctor may suggest an extensively hydrolyzed, casein-based formula. Avoid milk outside the kitchen. Check labels on cosmetics , creams, and ointments to see if they contain cow’s milk in any form. Some medicines also contain whey, which is made from milk.']"
28,What Is Lactose Intolerance?,"['Millions of Americans can’t digest a certain sugar in milk and milk products called lactose. If you’re one of them, you have lactose intolerance . The condition isn’t harmful, but it can be uncomfortable and may be embarrassing. There’s no cure, but you can manage it by watching how much milk or milk products you drink or eat. Being lactose intolerant is not the same as being allergic to milk. A food allergy is an immune system response.', 'What Is Lactose? Lactose is the sugar that’s in milk. Our bodies use an enzyme called lactase to break down that sugar so we can absorb it into our bodies. But people with lactose intolerance don’t have enough lactase. It’s produced in the small intestine. Even with low levels of lactase, some people can digest milk products just fine. For people who are lactose intolerant, their low lactase levels give them symptoms after they eat dairy. What is lactose malabsorption?', ""When you have lactose malabsorption, your small intestine can't absorb the lactose you've taken in. It passes through your digestive system unabsorbed. When it gets to your large intestine, it may cause symptoms – that's intolerance. If you have lactose intolerance, then by definition, you're not absorbing lactose and have symptoms. But you can have lactose malabsorption without lactose intolerance. What percentage of people are lactose intolerant? Lactose intolerance is common. The risk of it is linked to your ethnicity. Lactose intolerance affects about 85% of Black adults in the U.S. and about 15% of White adults. It's also more likely to affect you if you have Hispanic, Asian, Native American, or Jewish ancestry."", 'What Happens in My Body if I’m Lactose Intolerant? When we drink milk or have a milk-based product, lactase in our small intestine breaks down the milk sugar. It then gets absorbed into the body through the small intestine . But people who are lactose intolerant don’t have it so easy. In them, the lactose doesn’t get broken down. Instead, it goes on to the colon , where it mixes with normal bacteria and ferments. It can cause things like gas, bloating , and diarrhea . The symptoms are no fun, but they’re not dangerous. Most people can manage their symptoms by changing their diet and limiting the amount of lactose they consume. Some people do better by cutting lactose out of their diet altogether.', 'Lactose Intolerance Causes The main cause of lactose intolerance is that you produce too little lactase, the enzyme in your small intestine that breaks down lactose. Your level of gut sensitivity also plays a role. It\'s not unusual to eat things your body can\'t fully digest. They pass through the small intestine into the colon, where they feed the bacteria living there. Those bacteria are different for each person. This is called your ""gut biome."" Every person\'s gut tolerance is different, because no two gut biomes are the same. That\'s why the level and the symptoms of lactose intolerance vary from person to person. Can you develop lactose intolerance? Most people become less tolerant of lactose as they get older, because our bodies produce less lactase as we age. Your gut biome changes, too. One study found that lactose malabsorption – which plays a key role in lactose intolerance – increases in people older than 65.', 'Lactose Intolerance Types Lactose intolerance breaks down into four types.', ""Primary lactose intolerance This is the most common type. It happens because your body gradually stops producing enough lactase for you to process dairy products. Secondary lactose intolerance This happens when an illness or injury causes your body to slow or stop making lactase. It could happen because of a condition like Crohn's disease, a bacterial infection of your intestines, or celiac disease. It might also start because you injured your small intestine or had surgery on it. Your lactose intolerance might improve – although slowly – once the other problem is dealt with. Congenital lactose intolerance It's rare, but you might be born not being able to produce enough lactase. This is caused by a gene you inherit from both parents. Developmental lactose intolerance Premature babies sometimes have lactose intolerance because their small intestines weren't fully developed at birth."", ""Lactose Intolerance Risk Factors Most adults around the world can’t digest milk – 40% of humans stop producing enough lactase to digest milk between the ages of 2 and 5. Risk factors for developing lactose intolerance include: Age. You produce less lactase as you grow older. Ethnicity. If your heritage is African, Asian, Hispanic, or Native American, your risk is higher. Premature birth. Babies born early can have digestive systems that aren't fully developed. Conditions that affect your small intestine. This includes things like Crohn's disease, celiac, and bacterial overgrowth. Cancer treatment. Radiation and chemotherapy can affect your gut."", 'Lactose Intolerance Symptoms Your symptoms might take hours to show up after you eat dairy products, because it takes time for the undigested lactose to move into your large intestine. They can include: Bloating Gas Nausea and vomiting Stomach cramps and pain Diarrhea Stomach noise – gurgling and rumbling', 'Lactose Intolerance Tests Your body may be able to handle some lactose without symptoms. Experiment to find out the types and amounts of products with lactose you can eat and drink. There are some steps you can take to test yourself: Go without milk or milk products for a couple of weeks. If your symptoms disappear, bring dairy products back into your diet a little at a time to take note of how you react. If your symptoms continue after cutting out the dairy – or if they return – see your doctor to find out what’s going on.', ""Your doctor can test for lactose intolerance: Breath test. This will show if you have high levels of hydrogen when you exhale. If you do, you might be lactose intolerant. That’s because hydrogen is given off when lactose is broken down in the colon. The hydrogen gets taken by the blood up to your lungs , and then you exhale it. Blood test. This can show how your body reacts after you drink something with a lot of lactose. Your doctor might do this test if the results of the breath test aren't clear. Stool acidity test. This is the test used for children and infants.

If your blood flow gets blocked anywhere, one of the many issues that can happen is a TIA. When you have a TIA, the flow of blood to part of your brain gets cut off for a short time. It\'s also called a ministroke, but don\'t let the ""mini"" part fool you. A TIA can be a sign that a full-blown stroke is on the way. About 1 in 3 people who have a TIA go on to have a stroke , often within a year.', ""TIA Symptoms The symptoms of a TIA can happen suddenly. They're similar to early stroke symptoms. They include: Droopy face. Your eyes or mouth may droop on one side. You may also have trouble smiling. Speaking problems. Your speech may be slurred, garbled, or hard to understand. It might be difficult to find the right words."", ""Weak or numb arms. You may have trouble lifting and holding up both arms. Those are the clearest red flags, but you may also notice: Balance and coordination problems Blindness or blurred vision in one or both eyes Not being able to move one side of your body Confusion and a hard time understanding others Dizziness A sudden, severe headache Trouble swallowing You can have more than one TIA. Each TIA can have different symptoms, based on which part of your brain is affected. Post-TIA symptoms After a TIA, you might notice some long-term effects. Since these could affect your work or other daily activities, you may want to tell your employer and loved ones about it. TIA lasting affects can include: Fatigue. You can get very tired after a TIA. Fatigue is when your sleepiness is extreme but doesn't get better with rest. Emotional shifts. After you have a TIA, you might feel shocked or anxious about your well-being. It's important to talk to your friends and family about your anxiety, to help your overall mood. Sharing your feelings can help others better understand what you're going through. Regular exercise can also help get rid of some tension and boost your energy."", ""A need to focus more on your health. It's important to follow treatment advice from your doctor. You can choose healthy lifestyle habits. Eat healthy meals, quit smoking, and be more active. All of these things can help lower your risk of a stroke. If you continue to have physical, memory, or thinking troubles after a TIA, talk to your doctor."", 'TIA Causes A TIA can happen when a blood clot gets lodged in an artery that supplies blood to your brain . Without regular blood flow, your brain is starved for oxygen and can\'t work the way it normally does. That\'s why you get symptoms like muscle weakness or slurred speech with a TIA. It\'s like having a clogged fuel line in your car. Your engine can\'t run if it\'s not getting gas. Clots form when you have a buildup of a fatty, waxy substance called plaque in your arteries. They can take shape anywhere in your body, and float along until they get stuck somewhere. If that ""somewhere"" happens to be an artery that goes to your brain , you can have a TIA. You can also get a TIA if there\'s so much plaque in an artery that it severely limits blood flow to your brain, just like a clot.', ""TIA Diagnosis If you have symptoms of a TIA, it's important to see your doctor right away. A quick diagnosis is important, as it helps figure out what caused your TIA. It also allows your doctor to treat it properly. Your doctor might use: Physical and neurological exams. They'll test your vision, eye movement, speech, language, reflexes, strength, and sensory system. They might also listen to your carotid artery system through a stethoscope. They might look for other stroke risk factors like high cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes, or high homocysteine. Computerized tomography (CT) or computerized tomography angiography (CTA) scans. These help your doctor look at your brain, and at the arteries in your neck and brain. Carotid ultrasonography. If your doctor thinks your carotid artery caused your TIA, they'll use this tool to look closely at any narrowing or clotting in your neck. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). These help your doctor check your brain, arteries, and neck. Echocardiography. This tool allows your doctor to look clearly at possible causes, like blood clots, through an ultrasound image. Arteriography. This helps your doctor look at arteries in your brain that usually aren't seen on an X-ray."", ""TIA Treatment There are many ways to lower your risk of a stroke after a TIA. Your doctor will decide which is a best for you, based on your TIA type, cause, location, how serious it was, and findings on an MRI or CT scan. Immediate treatments include: Anti-platelet drugs, like acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) or clopidogrel (Plavix) Anticoagulant drugs, like warfarin (Jantoven) Surgery is another treatment for a TIA. If one of the carotid arteries in your neck is narrowed or blocked, you may need surgery to help clear it out and restore normal blood flow. One option is an operation called a carotid endarterectomy, where your doctor opens up your carotid artery , scrapes out the plaque, and closes it back up. Another choice is a procedure called carotid angioplasty and stenting. Your doctor makes a small opening in your groin. They'll use a balloon-like device to widen your carotid artery , then put in a small wire tube, called a stent , to keep it open. They then remove the balloon."", ""TIA Prevention To prevent a TIA, make these healthy lifestyle choices: Eat food that's good for you. Choose whole foods , meaning those that are as natural and unprocessed as possible. Also eat a low- fat , low-salt, high-fiber diet with plenty of fruits and veggies. Limit saturated fats and sugar , and avoid trans fats . Get a good night's sleep . Regular shut-eye can lower your risk of a stroke. Create a routine to relax at night and get to bed at a reasonable time. Limit alcohol . If you drink, keep it to one drink a day if you're female, or two if you're male. Manage your other health conditions. The more you control issues like high blood pressure , diabetes , and atrial fibrillation , the better. Stick to an exercise routine. Typically, you need at least 150 minutes of medium-level cardio , like brisk walking , each week. Check with your doctor to see what's safe for you. Stay at a healthy weight . This will help your blood pressure and cholesterol , too. Stop smoking . Tobacco harms your health in many ways, including raising your stroke risk."", ""Avoid illegal drugs . Drugs like amphetamines , cocaine , and heroin can raise your chances of a TIA or stroke. Along with other lifestyle changes, if you're a biological woman, you should take a few more steps to avoid a TIA or stroke. For instance, if you're over age 75, ask your doctor to check you for atrial fibrillation. If you're pregnant , have your blood pressure checked regularly during and after pregnancy. If you think you might start birth control pills , get checked for high blood pressure first. If you get migraines with auras, it's even more important that you stop smoking right away."", ""TIA vs. Stroke TIAs are similar to ischemic strokes, which are also caused by blood clots . The main difference is that a TIA only lasts a few minutes. The clot then gets pushed along, like a temporary clog in a pipe, or chemicals in your body quickly break it down. Normal blood flow returns to your brain before lasting problems set in. Symptoms can last for up to 24 hours, but they're usually gone in an hour. Strokes, on the other hand, don't go away so quickly. That means some part of your brain goes without oxygen, and the longer that lasts, the more damage happens. While a TIA comes on, goes away, and leaves no symptoms, a stroke can have long-lasting effects and can be life-threatening."", ""TIA Risk Factors A TIA can affect anyone. The same things that raise your odds of a stroke also affect your risk of a TIA, and there are a lot of issues in play. Risks you can't control. Some things you can't change, but it's helpful to be aware of them: Age . The odds of a TIA or stroke get much higher when you're over 55. After age 55, your risk for having a stroke doubles every 10 years. Family history . If one of your grandparents, parents, or a brother or sister had a stroke, you have a greater chance of getting a TIA. Previous TIA. Once you've had one, you're much more likely to get another. Race . African American people, as well as people who belong to South Asian and Caribbean ethnic groups, have a higher chance of a TIA than others. Gender. Women have a greater risk of strokes and TIAs than men."", 'Health conditions. Other medical problems you have can also increase the odds of a TIA, including: Being overweight Carotid artery disease , where the main arteries from your heart to your brain are narrowed or clogged Diabetes Heart disease , including heart defects and rhythm problems like atrial fibrillation ( AFib ) High blood pressure High cholesterol Peripheral artery disease (PAD), where arteries in your arms or legs get blocked Sickle cell disease , a genetic condition where misshaped blood cells can get wedged in arteries more easily COVID-19', ""Lifestyle. Some of the choices you make every day may affect your chances of having a TIA. You may have a higher risk if you: Drink a lot of alcohol Don't get enough exercise Eat too many foods high in cholesterol , saturated fats , and trans fats , and not enough fruits, veggies, and fiber Smoke Use drugs such as amphetamines , cocaine , and heroin Risks for women.

31,Miscarriage,"[""What Is a Miscarriage? A miscarriage is the loss of a pregnancy before the 20th week. Miscarriages are common. But it's hard to know exactly how often they happen because many times it's before you've even missed a period or know you're pregnant. About 10%-20% of recognized pregnancies will end in a miscarriage. But researchers estimate the overall rate is closer to 40%. Miscarriage rates by week More than 80% of miscarriages happen within the first 3 months of pregnancy . One study found that after week 5, your overall chances of miscarriage are about 1 in 5. From weeks 8 to 13, the rate of miscarriage drops to 2%-4%. Beyond week 14, your risk is 1% or less. The loss of a pregnancy after week 20 is called a stillbirth."", 'Miscarriage Symptoms Sometimes a miscarriage causes no symptoms. However, you may have: Bleeding that goes from light to heavy Severe cramps Belly pain Weakness Worsening or severe back pain Fever with any of these symptoms Weight loss White-pink mucus Contractions Tissue that looks like blood clots passing from your vagina Fewer signs of pregnancy If you have these symptoms, contact your doctor right away. They’ll tell you whether to come to the office or go to the emergency room.', ""Miscarriage Causes Most miscarriages happen when the embryo or fetus has fatal genetic problems. Usually, these problems are not related to the mother. Sometimes, a fertilized egg gets implanted in your uterus but stops developing. That's called an anembryonic pregnancy, or a blighted ovum. It also results in a miscarriage. Other problems that can increase the risk include: Infection Medical conditions in the mother, such as diabetes or thyroid disease Hormone problems Immune system responses Uterine abnormalities Smoking Drinking alcohol Using street drugs Exposure to radiation or toxic substances You have a higher risk of miscarriage if you: Are over age 35 Have certain diseases, such as diabetes or thyroid problems Have had two or more miscarriages Cervical insufficiency A miscarriage sometimes happens when you have a weakness in your cervix . Doctors call this cervical insufficiency. It means the cervix can’t hold the pregnancy. This type of miscarriage usually happens in the second trimester . There are usually few symptoms before a miscarriage caused by cervical insufficiency. You may feel sudden pressure, your water might break, and tissue from the baby and placenta could leave your body without much pain. Doctors usually treat an insufficient cervix with a “circling” stitch in the next pregnancy, usually around 12 weeks. The stitch holds your cervix closed until the doctor removes it around the time of delivery. If you never had a miscarriage but your doctor finds that you have cervical insufficiency, they might add the stitch to prevent a miscarriage."", ""Miscarriage Types There are different kinds of miscarriages, including: Chemical pregnancy. Also called a biochemical pregnancy, this type of miscarriage happens before 6 weeks. You've had a positive urine or blood test, but it's too early to have seen the pregnancy on an ultrasound. Threatened miscarriage. You’re bleeding and there’s the threat of a miscarriage, but your cervix hasn’t dilated. Your pregnancy will likely continue without any problems. Inevitable miscarriage. If you’re bleeding and cramping, and your cervix is dilated, a miscarriage is likely. Incomplete miscarriage. Some tissue from the baby or the placenta leaves your body, but some stays in your uterus. Complete miscarriage. All the pregnancy tissues leave your body. This type of miscarriage usually happens before the 12th week of pregnancy. Missed miscarriage. This is also called an asymptomatic or silent miscarriage. The embryo dies or was never formed, but the tissues stay in your uterus. Recurrent miscarriage. You lose two or more pregnancies in a row. This type of miscarriage only affects about 1% of couples trying to have a baby. Septic miscarriage. In this situation, the pregnancy loss is accompanied by an infection in your uterus. It's rare but can be life-threatening."", 'What’s the difference between a miscarriage and stillbirth? Both are pregnancy losses, but the difference is in the timing. Doctors in the U.S. consider it a miscarriage if it happens in the first 20 weeks, and a stillbirth beyond 20 weeks. In the U.K., the dividing line is at 24 weeks, while the World Health Organization considers it to be 22 weeks. What’s the difference between a miscarriage and an abortion? In scientific terms, any pregnancy that ends before a baby is able to survive on its own is an abortion. A spontaneous abortion is more commonly called a miscarriage. An induced abortion is what most people think of when they hear the word -- the intentional termination of a pregnancy by either a medical procedure or medication. Many doctors simply use the term pregnancy loss to refer to a miscarriage.', ""Miscarriage Diagnosis To check whether you've had a miscarriage, your doctor will do: A pelvic exam . They’ll check to see if your cervix has started to dilate. An ultrasound test. This test uses sound waves to check for a fetal heartbeat. If the results aren’t clear, you may go back for another test in a week. Blood tests. The doctor uses them to look for pregnancy hormones in your blood and compare it to past levels. They may also test you for anemia if you’ve been bleeding a lot. Tissue tests . If tissue leaves your body, the doctor may send it to a lab to confirm that you had a miscarriage. It can also help make sure there wasn’t another cause for your symptoms. Chromosome tests. If you’ve had two or more miscarriages, the doctor might do these tests to see if you or your partner’s genes are the cause."", ""How to confirm a miscarriage at home If you're having miscarriage symptoms such as bleeding and cramping, or you've stopped feeling pregnancy symptoms such as morning sickness or sore breasts, you can try taking a home pregnancy test. If it's negative, that's a good indication you've lost the pregnancy. But pregnancy hormones don't leave your body immediately, so a positive test doesn't necessarily mean everything's OK. You should see your doctor to confirm what's happening with your pregnancy."", 'Miscarriage Treatments If the miscarriage is complete and your uterus is empty, you probably won’t need further treatment. Sometimes, all the tissue doesn’t come out. If that happens, your doctor might recommend waiting a week or two for it to pass naturally. Or they may do a dilation and curettage (D&C) procedure. They’ll dilate your cervix and gently remove any remaining tissue. There are also medications you can take that cause any tissue left in your uterus to leave your body.', 'If it’s later in the pregnancy and the fetus has died in the uterus, the doctor will induce labor and delivery . When the bleeding stops, you should be able to go back to your normal activities. If your cervix dilated on its own but you’re still pregnant, you could have a condition known as incompetent cervix. Your doctor might do a procedure called cerclage to close it.', 'If your blood type is Rh negative, the doctor may give you a blood product called Rh immune globulin (RhoGAM). This prevents you from developing antibodies that could harm your baby or any future pregnancies. You may get blood tests, genetic tests, or medication if you’ve had two or more miscarriages in a row (recurrent miscarriage). To diagnose this condition, your doctor might use tests such as: Pelvic ultrasound Hysterosalpingogram, an x-ray of the uterus and fallopian tubes Hysteroscopy. The doctor uses a thin, telescope-like device inserted through your vagina and cervix to look inside your uterus.', ""If you've had two miscarriages in a row, use a form of birth control and talk to your doctor about tests to find the cause. Treatments for ‘recurrent miscarriage’ There are several ways doctors can help you have a successful pregnancy when you've experienced recurrent miscarriage, depending on what's causing it. They include: In vitro fertilization after testing for genetic problems with the embryo, or using donor sperm or eggs Surgery to correct problems in your uterus Medical treatment for infection or other health problems Hormone therapy Immune therapy About half of the time, doctors can't find a cause. In that case, they may suggest boosting your overall health and practicing self-care, such as reducing stress and getting psychological support or therapy.

32,What Is Misophonia?,"['Do certain daily sounds trigger an over-the-top emotional reaction, but yet don’t seem to bother anyone else? This is the case with misophonia -- a strong dislike or hatred of specific sounds.', 'What Happens? Misophonia is a disorder in which certain sounds trigger emotional or physiological responses that some might perceive as unreasonable given the circumstance. Those who have misophonia might describe it as when a sound\xa0“drives you crazy.” Their reactions can range from anger and annoyance to panic and the need to flee. The disorder is sometimes called selective sound sensitivity syndrome. Individuals with misophonia often report they are triggered by oral sounds \xa0-- the noise someone makes when they eat, breathe, or even chew. Other adverse sounds include keyboard or finger tapping or the sound of windshield wipers. Sometimes a small repetitive motion is the cause -- someone fidgets, jostles you, or wiggles their foot. Similarly, people with misophonia also say they often react to the visual stimuli that accompanies sounds, and may also respond intensely to repetitive motions.\xa0Researchers believe that those with misophonia may already have issues with how their brains filter sounds and that one of the features of “misophonic sounds” may be their repetitive noise. That repetition then exacerbates the other auditory processing problems.', 'The disorder appears to range from mild to severe. Individuals report a range of physiologic and emotional responses, with accompanying cognitions. If you have a mild reaction, you might feel: Anxious Uncomfortable The urge to flee Disgust If your response is more severe, the sound in question might cause: Rage Anger Hatred Panic Fear Emotional distress The disorder can put a cramp in your social life. Those with misophonia have been known to develop anticipatory anxiety when going into situations where trigger sounds may be present. You might avoid restaurants or eat separately from your spouse, family, or roommates. Over time, you may also respond to visual triggers, too. Seeing something that you know may create the offending sound may elicit\xa0a response.', 'How Do You Get It? The\xa0age of the onset of this lifelong condition is not known but some people report symptoms between the ages of 9 and 13. Misophonia is more common with girls and comes on quickly, although it doesn’t appear to be related to any one event.', 'Doctors aren’t sure what causes misophonia, but it’s not a problem with your ears. They think it’s part mental, part physical. It could be related to how sound affects your brain and triggers automatic responses in your body. Because your ears are normal and your hearing is OK, the doctor may have trouble with a diagnosis. Misophonia is sometimes mistaken for anxiety or bipolar or obsessive-compulsive disorder. Some doctors think it should be classified as a new disorder. Often doctors are unaware of the condition, and there is no consensus in regard to classification. Misophonia appears to occur on its own and also along with other health, developmental and psychiatric problems. A breakthrough study recently found that misophonia is a brain-based disorder. Researchers point to a disruption in the connectivity in parts of the brain that process both sound stimulation and the fight/flight response. It also involves parts of the brain that code the importance of sounds.', 'How Do You Treat It? The condition does affect daily life, but you can learn to manage it. Treatment often involves a multidisciplinary approach combining sound therapy by audiologists and supportive counseling in which coping strategies are emphasized. You might try a device like a hearing aid that creates a sound in your ear similar to a waterfall. The noise distracts you from triggers and reduces reactions. Other treatments include talk therapy. Your lifestyle also plays a role. Get regular exercise, plenty of sleep, and manage your stress. You can also wear ear plugs and headsets to tune out sounds. Set up quiet areas or safe spots in your home where no one will make the noises that bother you. And find support. The Misophonia Association is based in Oregon and California, and holds a yearly convention for suffers. The International Misophonia Research Network Misophonia-Research.com is a resource for doctors and researchers interested in learning more about misophonia.

Polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ) and hypothyroidism are two common causes of irregular periods in women. In general, the goal of treatment is to restore the balance of hormones in the body. If you have PCOS, your doctor may recommend birth control pills or other hormones to trigger a period. If you have hypothyroidism ( underactive thyroid ), you may need to take thyroid hormones. Other things that may help include: Changing birth control . If you have irregular periods after 3 months of hormonal birth control , your doctor may recommend another type of birth control . Some women develop irregular periods when using Nexplanon , Depo- Provera , or an IUD. Lifestyle changes. Some women have changes in their period because they exercise too much. You may need to make your workouts less intense or exercise less often. If stress is the problem, learning how to manage your stress -- and possibly also talking with a counselor -- may be helpful.', 'Extreme changes in your weight can affect your periods. Weight gain can make it harder for your body to ovulate, so weight loss could help with that. But extreme, sudden weight loss can also lead to infrequent or irregular periods. Hormone therapy (HT). An irregular menstrual cycle is often due to a lack of or imbalance in certain hormones in the body. Doctors often prescribe birth control pills (oral contraceptives ) containing the hormones estrogen and progesterone to help control irregular periods. A hormone medication called progestin can also help trigger periods in women who don’t get them. If you have irregular periods and are trying to get pregnant , your doctor may prescribe other hormone treatments. Surgery. Sometimes, scarring or structural problems in the uterus (womb) or fallopian tubes may lead to irregular periods. Your doctor may recommend surgery to correct any structural problems or birth defects , particularly if you know you want to have children. It may also be done to remove severe scar tissue in the reproductive tract.', 'When to Call a Doctor Call your doctor if you have had regular, monthly periods and the pattern changes. Your doctor may give you a physical exam and other tests to rule out pregnancy or a health problem. Call your doctor if you have any of the following symptoms: You miss three or more periods a year. You get your period more often than every 21 days. You get your period less often than every 35 days. You are bleeding more heavily than usual during your period. You bleed for more than 7 days. You have more pain than usual during a period.']"
34,Burning Feet,"['A burning sensation in your feet may be caused by nerve damage in the legs, also called neuropathy. Although many medical conditions can cause burning feet , diabetes is the most common. Most burning feet treatments focus on preventing further nerve damage and reducing pain. See More: What Your Feet Say About Your Health', 'Causes of Burning Feet Most often, neuropathy is the cause of burning feet. Damaged nerve fibers are more likely to become overactive and misfire. The damaged nerves send pain signals to the brain even though there is no wound. In most people with neuropathy, the leg nerves become damaged first. These people often have tingling and numbness in the feet as well. Many people complain that their feet are overly sensitive to touch (hyperesthesia) and can have varying degrees of burning pain. It can range from mild to disabling. Diabetes and alcohol abuse are by far the most common causes of neuropathy in the legs. Many other conditions can cause neuropathy or a burning sensation in the feet: Chronic kidney disease (uremia) Small fiber neuropathy Vitamin deficiency ( vitamin B12 , folate, and occasionally vitamin B6 ) Alcohol abuse Low thyroid hormone levels ( hypothyroidism ) Lyme disease HIV /AIDS Amyloid polyneuropathy Drug side effects, including chemotherapy drugs, vitamin B6 overdose, HIV medicines, amiodarone , isoniazid , metformin , and others Erythromelalgia Heavy metal poisoning (lead, mercury, arsenic) Vasculitis ( inflammation of blood vessels) Sarcoidosis Guillain -Barre syndrome (GBS) Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP)', ""Besides neuropathy, infections and inflammation of the feet can also cause a burning sensation. The most common of these is athlete's foot , an infection of the skin caused by fungus. Peripheral artery disease (PAD) also commonly causes burning feet. The poor circulation of blood to the feet may frequently cause pain , tingling, and burning feet, especially while walking. Weeks or months after gastric bypass surgery , some people experience a burning feet sensation. Poor absorption of B vitamins after gastric bypass can cause neuropathy in the legs and a sensation of burning feet."", 'Diagnosing Burning Feet Most people who have burning feet have a likely cause (such as diabetes ) that can be identified. For these people, the diagnosis of burning feet due to neuropathy is straightforward, and additional testing is not needed. In a few people whose burning sensation is sudden, rapidly worsening, or has no explainable cause, further testing may be needed to make a correct diagnosis. These tests may include: Electromyography (EMG). A test of muscle function using recordings of electrical activity inside the muscles. A probe may be placed on the skin, or a needle may be inserted into the muscle, for an EMG test. Nerve conduction study. A nerve conduction study tests the ability of nerves to transmit impulses. A nerve is stimulated, and the response in the muscle controlled by that nerve is measured. Laboratory tests. Sometimes, tests of blood, urine, or spinal fluid may be suggested to help diagnose the cause of burning feet. Vitamin levels can be checked with a simple blood test. Nerve biopsy . Very rarely, a doctor may suggest cutting out a piece of nerve tissue and examining it under a microscope.', 'Treatments for Burning Feet The most important treatment for burning feet due to neuropathy is to stop any ongoing nerve damage . In some cases treatment of the underlying disease will improve the neuropathy and symptoms. In other situations, like a small fiber neuropathy, where no cause can be identified, the physician will focus on treating the person’s symptoms. For people with diabetic neuropathy , treatment means keeping blood sugar levels in the normal range. This usually requires dietary changes, oral medications , and often insulin injections. For people with other forms of neuropathy that cause burning feet, preventing further nerve damage is equally important. Specific conditions and their treatments include: Vitamin deficiency. Taking additional vitamin B12 orally or by injection can replace low levels of this nutrient. Alcoholism . Stopping excessive drinking prevents ongoing nerve damage and allows nerves to heal. Chronic kidney disease. Dialysis may be necessary to eliminate toxins causing neuropathy and burning feet symptoms. Hypothyroidism . Taking oral thyroid hormone raises low thyroid levels, often reversing neuropathy as well as burning feet symptoms. GBS and CIDP. Treatments are very specialized and include plasma exchange ( plasmapheresis ) or immune globulin therapy (IVIG).', ""Burning feet treatments include treating the pain and abnormal sensations created by neuropathy. Some commonly prescribed medications for burning feet include: amitriptyline carbamazepine ( Tegretol ) desipramine ( Norpramin ) duloxetine ( Cymbalta ) gabapentin ( Neurontin ) pregabalin ( Lyrica ) topiramate (Topamax) venlafaxine ( Effexor XR ) Other pain medications may be necessary to reduce the severe discomfort some people experience from burning feet. Over-the-counter medicines like Advil , Aleve , Motrin IB, and Tylenol control pain in many people with burning feet. Prescription pain relievers like tramadol ( Ultram ) or low-dose opiates (narcotics) may be necessary for severe pain. For burning feet caused by athlete's foot, antifungal drugs can cure the fungal infection and relieve burning feet symptoms. Over-the-counter medicines like miconazole ( Micatin ) or terbinafine ( Lamisil AT) should be used first. Prescription antifungals like fluconazole ( Diflucan ), itraconazole (Sporanox), and naftifine ( Naftin ) are also available.""]"
35,What Is Mitral Valve Regurgitation?,"['What Is Mitral Valve Regurgitation? When your heart pumps blood , it’s supposed to follow a specific path in one direction. But sometimes, it goes the wrong way. Mitral valve regurgitation is when your blood isn’t going where it should. With this condition, some of it leaks backward instead of flowing out to the rest of your body. You may feel tired and out of breath if you have it. You may also have higher blood pressure and a buildup of fluid in your lungs . Your doctor may refer to it by one of its other names, which include: Mitral valve insufficiency or mitral insufficiency Mitral regurgitation Mitral valve incompetence or mitral incompetence Leaky heart valve They can confirm whether you have a mild case and might not even need treatment, or a more serious situation that will need medication or surgery. There are two types of mitral valve regurgitation, depending on the cause, including: Primary or degenerative mitral valve regurgitation. In this type, something has damaged the valve so that it can’t close properly. For example, infections and inflammation can damage your mitral valve. Secondary or functional mitral valve regurgitation. In this type, there’s nothing wrong with your mitral valve, but a problem elsewhere in your heart prevents it from functioning properly. Heart failure and arrhythmias, for example, can cause secondary mitral valve regurgitation. Both types of mitral valve regurgitation can be either acute (developing suddenly) or chronic (developing gradually over time). Mitral valve regurgitation is when your blood isn’t going where it should. With this condition, some of it leaks backward instead of flowing out to the rest of your body.  You may feel tired and out of breath if you have it. You may also have higher blood pressure and a buildup of fluid in your lungs. (Photo credit: BSIP/Jacopin/Medical Images)', 'Heart Basics Before you understand the details of how blood can flow the wrong way in one part of your heart , you need to know how things should work. The heart has four chambers: the left and right atrium on top and, below them, the left and right ventricles. As your heart beats, it draws blood from the body into the right atrium. This chamber sends it down to the right ventricle. From there, your blood is pumped to the lungs to pick up oxygen. When that oxygen-rich blood goes back to the heart, the left atrium takes it in and passes it down to the left ventricle. That chamber contracts, or squeezes, to send it to your body. You have a passageway between the left atrium and the left ventricle. That is the mitral valve.', ""Mitral Valve Insufficiency The mitral valve is supposed to be a one-way passage between your heart's left atrium and left ventricle. It has two flaps, called leaflets. With each contraction of your heart, these leaflets open to allow blood to flow through, and then they close tightly. Along with the other three valves in your heart, the opening and closing of your mitral valve helps keep your blood flowing properly."", 'But sometimes, the mitral valve doesn’t seal properly when it closes. This creates a leak that allows blood to flow backward through it, returning to the left atrium. When this happens, you have mitral valve regurgitation. A small leak may not cause noticeable problems, but larger leaks force your heart to work harder to pump the right amount of blood. Over time, this can lead to serious complications, including heart failure and abnormal heart rhythms, also called arrhythmias. Mitral valve regurgitation can also be fatal.', 'Mitral Valve Regurgitation Symptoms Some people with this condition may not feel any symptoms, while others may have chest pain, shortness of breath, an irregular heartbeat, or dizziness, among other things. If you have mild regurgitation you may not notice any symptoms. But if the condition worsens, you might have: Heart palpitations , which happen when your heart skips a beat. They produce feelings in your chest that can range from fluttering to pounding and may be more likely to happen when you’re lying on your left side. Coughing Fatigue and shortness of breath. The blood coming through the left side of your heart fuels your body, bringing oxygen from your lungs to your cells. If some of that blood is flowing back into the heart instead, you might end up feeling tired or lightheaded, particularly if you’ve been active. In severe cases, you can find yourself feeling tired or short of breath even when you’re at rest. Rapid breathing Chest pain Swelling of feet and legs. This is caused by a buildup of fluid in your body, known as edema. It’s a sign that your heart may be struggling to pump enough blood to the rest of your body.', ""Some other things you or your doctor may notice: You get very tired more easily. You have a heart murmur (blood whooshing or swishing around). You have low blood pressure. You might faint. Some symptoms signal a medical emergency. Call 911 if you have any of the following symptoms, which can be a sign of acute heart failure: Tightness in your chest Feeling of suffocation Heavy breathing Breathing that's challenging when you're lying down Low blood oxygen"", 'Mitral Valve Regurgitation Causes Numerous health conditions can cause mitral valve regurgitation. They include: Mitral valve prolapse. Often harmless and requiring no treatment, this condition causes the leaflets to bulge, or prolapse, into your left atrium rather than closing properly. Rheumatic heart disease. This is caused by rheumatic fever , a condition that can develop if strep throat goes untreated. It causes inflammation that can damage your mitral valve. Heart attack. This can damage the heart muscles that control your mitral valve, leading to sudden and severe mitral valve regurgitation. Congenital heart defects. These are problems you’re born with, such as a cleft mitral valve, a rare condition in which one of your mitral valve leaflets has a split in it. Cardiomyopathy. These are diseases of the heart muscle. The most common is ischemic cardiomyopathy, in which your heart muscle gets damaged due to lack of oxygen. Others include dilated cardiomyopathy and hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. Damaged tissue cords. The tissue that holds the leaflets of your mitral valve in place can stretch and tear due to traumatic injury to your chest, as can mitral valve prolapse. Infective endocarditis. This is inflammation of the lining of your heart’s valves and chambers. It’s a type of bacterial infection that can damage your mitral valve.', 'Mitral Valve Regurgitation Risk Factors In addition to the above causes, your risk of developing mitral valve regurgitation rises if you: Are over age 65. Have a family history of heart valve disorders or early heart disease. Have lifestyle habits that can lead to other types of heart disease, such as smoking, lack of exercise, poor diet, and obesity. Use a medical device, such as an implanted cardioverter defibrillator or pacemaker, which can rub against your mitral valve and cause scarring. They also can stretch your mitral valve. Have other conditions that affect your heart, including high blood pressure, diabetes, and autoimmune diseases such as lupus, and heart conditions. Have undergone radiation therapy for cancer.', 'Mitral Valve Regurgitation Complications Mitral valve regurgitation can lead to very serious and even life-threatening conditions. These include: Heart failure. Severe mitral valve regurgitation reduces the amount of blood flowing out of your heart to the rest of your body. To make up for this, your heart has to work harder to pump enough blood. Over time, this causes your heart’s main pumping chamber, your left ventricle, to become larger and weaker. This results in heart failure , in which your heart can’t do its job adequately. Atrial fibrillation. This is an arrhythmia that causes an erratic, often rapid heartbeat. This makes it harder for your heart to pump blood efficiently. Instead, blood backs up and pools in your left atrium, where it thickens. This allows clots to form. If one of those clots gets into your bloodstream and travels to your brain, it can cause a stroke. Pulmonary hypertension. This means high blood pressure in the lungs. It narrows the arteries in your lungs, which makes it harder for your heart to pump blood from your heart to your lungs. This can lead to heart failure, blood clots in your lungs, abnormal heart rhythms, and other serious complications. It also can lead to an irregular or uneven heartbeat or a stroke .', 'Mitral Valve Regurgitation Diagnosis Doctors usually find a problem with your heart valve by listening to your heart and lungs with a stethoscope. If blood is leaking back into your left atrium, it will produce a murmur or a whooshing sound. That will lead to several tests to determine whether you have mitral valve regurgitation or another condition that could be causing the murmur. These tests include: Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). This noninvasive and painless test uses sound waves to create detailed pictures of your mitral valve as well as images of blood flow through your heart. This will help your doctor diagnose mitral valve regurgitation as well as how severe it is. It also can be used to determine the cause, such as a birth defect, rheumatic heart disease, or any other condition affecting your mitral valve. Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE). This test, which also uses sound waves to image your heart, may be necessary if your doctor needs more detailed pictures of what’s happening in your heart. During the test, your doctor will guide a long, thin tube down your throat to your chest. A device called a transducer, attached to the tube, bounces sound waves off your heart to create echoes, which a computer then converts to highly detailed pictures. Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG). During this painless, noninvasive test, sensors are attached to your chest, and sometimes to your arms and legs. These sensors transmit signals that show how your heart beats. This test can identify arrhythmias related to mitral valve regurgitation. Chest X-ray. This provides pictures that can identify whether you have an enlarged heart or fluid in your lungs. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This test creates images of your heart using magnetic fields and radio waves. It helps your doctor determine the severity of your mitral valve regurgitation. It also can provide valuable information about your left ventricle, your heart’s lower left chamber. Exercise and stress tests. This tests how your heart responds to exercise and whether your mitral valve regurgitation symptoms occur during physical activity. The test will be conducted on a treadmill or stationary bike. If you can’t exercise, you will be given a medication that affects the heart the same way that exercise does. Cardiac catheterization. Though not frequently used to diagnose mitral valve regurgitation, your doctor may recommend this test if other tests have not had clear results. This test involves inserting a thin and flexible tube called a catheter into a blood vessel in your arm and groin. Your doctor guides it to your heart. Once there, a special dye flows through the tube into your heart. This dye enables your doctor to create clearer X-ray pictures of your heart’s chambers. You may get follow-up tests from time to time, depending on your case.', 'Mitral Valve Regurgitation Stages When you’re diagnosed, your doctor will determine the current stage of your mitral valve regurgitation. The stage depends on a few different factors: The severity of the disease Your symptoms The structure of your mitral valve How blood flows through your heart and lungs. The four stages are: Stage A: At risk. You have no symptoms and only minor signs of valve problems, such as mild mitral valve prolapse or mild thickening of your mitral valve. Stage B: Progressive. You don’t have any symptoms yet, but problems have begun to get more serious, such as moderate to severe mitral valve prolapse. Stage C: Asymptomatic severe. You still have no symptoms, but your mitral valve prolapse has become severe and your mitral valve can no longer close fully. Stage D: Symptomatic severe. It is similar to stage C, but now you\xa0have symptoms during physical activity, such as shortness of breath', 'How Fast Does Mitral Regurgitation Progress? The answer is different for different people. It can be a slow-moving disease, or it can get worse more quickly. Doctors can tell how far your disease has progressed by measuring how much blood leaks through your mitral valve. How well you will do depends on a few different factors, including: The cause of your mitral valve regurgitation The stage of your disease The severity of your disease How long you have had mitral valve regurgitation', 'Mitral Valve Regurgitation Treatment If you have a mild case, you might need no treatments at all. Your doctor will still want to keep a watchful eye on you with regular checkups. Here’s a likely follow-up schedule: If you have a mild case, expect to undergo an echocardiogram test every 3-5 years. If you have a moderate case, you should have an echo every year or two. If you have a severe case, you should see your doctor at least every 6-12 months. Medications Medications can’t actually fix a valve problem, but they can target other things that make regurgitation worse or conditions that arise as complications of your mitral valve regurgitation. These include: Diuretics (or “water pills”) increase the amount that you pee. This helps relieve fluid buildup that can develop in your lungs. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors relax your arteries and veins, lowering your blood pressure. They also lower the amount of blood that leaks back into your left atrium. Anticoagulants (or blood thinners ) prevent clots from forming and lower your risk of stroke if you have atrial fibrillation. In more severe cases, you might need an operation.', 'Mitral Valve Regurgitation Surgery Not everyone with mitral valve regurgitation will require surgery, but if your disease does continue to get worse over time, a procedure may become necessary. The decision about whether to fix it and what type of procedure to use depends on several things: The severity of your valve problem Your age and health Whether you need surgery for other heart conditions Surgery for\xa0mitral valve regurgitation is done to repair or replace your mitral valve. Your surgeon attempts to fix your mitral valve by: Patching holes in your valve. Reconnecting the leaflets of your valve. Removing excess valve tissue to allow your valve to close properly. Replacing the string-like chords that support your mitral valve with artificial chords. Separating the leaflets of your valve if they have become connected. Specific repair procedures include: Annuloplasty, in which your surgeon tightens or reinforces your mitral valve by permanently placing a flexible mesh, metal, or plastic ring around your valve to help it open and close properly. Valvuloplasty, which is done if your valve has a narrowed opening. Your doctor inserts a catheter into an artery and guides it to your mitral valve. Once there, a balloon is inflated, widening the opening of your valve. Mitral valve clip, also called transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER), in which a catheter is guided to your heart and used to attach a clip to your mitral valve. The clip helps your valve to close properly.', 'Mitral valve replacement If your mitral valve can’t be repaired, it will need to be replaced. Your new valve will be either: Mechanical, or made of carbon and steel, which typically lasts 20-30 years, so you may not need a second surgery. However, they increase your risk of blood clots, which require you to take blood thinners for the rest of your life. Biological, made of tissue taken from pigs, cows, or in rare cases humans. These are less durable than mechanical valves and may need replacement after 10-15 years. They don’t raise your risk of blood clots, so you won’t need to take blood thinners. Replacement surgery usually requires open heart surgery. However, you may qualify for a minimally invasive procedure called transcatheter mitral valve repair or replacement (TMVR). Ask your doctor if this is an option for you. Open-heart surgery This is the most common way to repair or replace your heart valve. You may need it even if you don’t have any symptoms. That’s because your doctor might decide this will prevent long-term heart damage.', 'Usually, doctors prefer to repair the valve instead of replacing it. It all depends on your particular case, though. If you get a replacement, the valve may be a man-made device or it could come from a pig, a cow, or someone who signed up for organ donation before they died. During open-heart surgery, you’ll be given something so you won’t be awake. You will not feel pain during the procedure. Other types of surgery Sometimes, doctors will decide someone is too sick to have open-heart surgery. They have other options. Your doctor could recommend what’s called “minimally invasive heart surgery.” Instead of opening up your chest, your doctor creates one or more small cuts and works through them. Depending on the kind of procedure, the surgeon may use a robotic arm or a long, flexible tube called a thoracoscope that holds a tiny video camera. Like open-heart surgery, you’ll be given something so you won’t be awake or feel any pain while it’s going on.', ""This is a newer field of surgery, so you want to ask your doctor about the experience level of the team and the hospital in doing this type of procedure. Catheters Your doctor may not think you’re healthy enough for surgery or that the fix can be made with a procedure that's easier on you.\xa0Some hospitals are able to use catheters to repair or replace the valve. Several types of procedures use these small, flexible tubes. Your doctor inserts the catheter into a blood vessel in your leg and guides it toward your heart. It may hold a clip at the end to repair your valve. Or it may carry a balloon that’s inflated at the right spot to make room for a replacement valve. During these procedures, you are given something to help you stay calm, but you may be awake. Before and after your hospital stay It’s a good idea to plan for your first week of meals before you go into the hospital. You can make them ahead of time and freeze them. That makes it easy for a relative or friend to warm up the food for you."", 'Arrange for someone to drive you to and from the hospital while you’re recovering. Ask someone to listen to the doctor’s instructions when you’re sent home from the hospital. You may not be thinking as clearly as normal because of the surgery. You may even want to consider home health care during the early stages of your recovery. You’ll need to remember the medication and the proper doses you need to take after surgery. Use a chart or tracker to help you keep up your schedule.', 'Living With Mitral Valve Regurgitation No matter what stage your regurgitation is at, there are things you can do at home to manage it. Your doctor may bring up many of the following: Keep your appointments. You need to make your health a top priority. That means putting visits to your doctor at the top of your to-do list. Eating well. You need to eat lots of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and proteins. You’ll need to limit salt, added sugars, saturated and trans fats, and alcohol. Your doctor may recommend what’s called the “Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension” diet, or DASH. Exercise. It plays a big role in managing many types of heart disease. You’ll need to talk to your doctor about what kinds of physical activity are safest for you. Your doctor might recommend at least 2.5 hours of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise every week and a limit on the amount of sitting you do. Stress. It’s important to learn how to cope with stress in a healthy way. Stress can trigger a heart attack or chest pain in some people. Medication (prescribed by a doctor), exercise, and relaxation therapy are a few ways to reduce tension. Smoking. It increases your risk for heart attacks and worsens regurgitation. If you are a smoker and have trouble quitting, talk to your doctor about ways you can break the habit.', 'Support groups', 'You may find you need help in learning to live with this condition. Maybe you just need someone to talk to. There are support groups that can help you handle the emotional side of a diagnosis. Family and friends are often a good place to turn to for support. You can also ask your doctor about other support options in your city. They often have people on staff who can help to get you started.']"
36,Connective Tissue Disease,"['Connective tissue disease refers to a group of disorders involving the protein-rich tissue that supports organs and other parts of the body. Examples of connective tissue are fat, bone, and cartilage. These disorders often involve the joints, muscles, and skin , but they can also involve other organs and organ systems, including the eyes , heart , lungs , kidneys , gastrointestinal tract, and blood vessels. There are more than 200 disorders that affect the connective tissue. Causes and specific symptoms vary by the different types.', 'Inherited Disorders of Connective Tissue Some connective tissue diseases -- often called heritable disorders of connective tissue (HDCTs) -- are the result of changes in certain genes. Many of these are quite rare. Following are some of the more common ones. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS). Actually a group of more than 10 disorders, EDS is characterized by over-flexible joints, stretchy skin, and abnormal growth of scar tissue. Symptoms can range from mild to disabling. Depending on the specific form of EDS, other symptoms may include: A curved spine Weak blood vessels Bleeding gums Problems with the lungs, heart valves, or digestion', 'Epidermolysis bullosa (EB). People with EB have skin that is so fragile that it tears or blisters as a result of a minor bump, stumble, or even friction from clothing. Some forms of EB may involve the digestive tract, the respiratory tract, the muscles, or the bladder . Caused by defects of several proteins in the skin, EB is usually evident at birth. Marfan syndrome . Marfan syndrome affects the bones, ligaments, eyes , heart, and blood vessels. People with Marfan syndrome tend to be tall and have extremely long bones and thin ""spider-like"" fingers and toes. Other problems may include eye problems due to abnormal placement of the eye lens and enlargement of the aorta (the largest artery in the body), which can lead to a fatal rupture. Marfan syndrome is caused by mutations in the gene that regulates the structure of a protein called fibrillin-1. Osteogenesis imperfecta . Osteogenesis imperfecta is a condition of brittle bones, low muscle mass, and lax joints and ligaments. There are several types of this condition. Specific symptoms depend on the specific type and may include: Blue or gray tint to the whites of the eyes Thin skin Curved spine Breathing problems Hearing loss Teeth that break easily The disease occurs when a mutation in two genes responsible for type 1 collagen reduces the amount or quality of the protein. Type 1 collagen is important to the structure of bone and skin.', ""Autoimmune Diseases For other forms of connective tissue disease, the cause is not known. In some cases, researchers believe the disorder may be triggered by something in the environment of people who may be genetically susceptible. In these diseases, the body's normally protective immune system produces antibodies that target the body's own tissues for attack. These diseases include the following . Polymyositis and dermatomyositis . These are two related diseases in which there is inflammation of the muscles (polymyositis) and skin (dermatomyositis). Symptoms of both diseases can include: Muscle weakness Fatigue Difficulty swallowing Shortness of breath Fever Weight loss People with dermatomyositis may also have a skin involvement around the eyes and the hands. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Rheumatoid arthritis is a disease in which the immune system attacks the thin membrane (called the synovium) lining the joints, causing pain, stiffness, warmth and swelling of the joints, and inflammation throughout the body. Other symptoms may include: Fatigue Anemia Fever Loss of appetite RA can lead to permanent joint damage and deformity."", ""Scleroderma. Scleroderma is a term for a group of disorders that causes thick, tight skin, buildup of scar tissue, and organ damage. These disorders fall into two general categories: localized scleroderma and systemic sclerosis . Localized scleroderma is confined to the skin and, sometimes, the muscle beneath it. Systemic sclerosis also involves the blood vessels and major organs. Sjögren's syndrome . Sjögren's syndrome is a chronic disease in which the immune system attacks the moisture-producing glands, such as those of the eyes and mouth. The effects can range from mildly uncomfortable to debilitating. Although dry eyes and mouth are the main symptoms of Sjögren's, many people also experience extreme fatigue and joint pain . The condition also increases the risk of lymphoma and may cause problems with the kidneys , lungs, blood vessels, and digestive system as well as nerve problems. Systemic lupus erythematosus. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE or simply lupus) is a disease characterized by inflammation of the joints, skin, and internal organs. Symptoms may include: A butterfly-shaped rash on the cheeks and bridge of the nose Sensitivity to sunlight Mouth ulcers Hair loss Fluid around the heart and/or lungs Kidney problems Anemia or other blood cell problems Problems with memory and concentration or other nervous system disorders"", 'Vasculitis . Vasculitis is a general term for more than 20 different conditions characterized by inflammation of the blood vessels. These can affect blood flow to the organs and other body tissues. Vasculitis can involve any of the blood vessels. Mixed connective tissue disease. People with MCTD have some features characteristic of several diseases, including lupus, scleroderma, polymyositis or dermatomyositis, and rheumatoid arthritis. When this occurs, doctors often make the diagnosis of mixed connective tissue disease. While many people with mixed connective tissue disease have mild symptoms, others may experience life-threatening complications.']"
37,Porphyria,"['What Is Porphyria? Porphyria is a group of disorders that can cause nerve or skin problems . There\'s no cure, but you can get treatments that will help you manage your symptoms. If you have porphyria that affects your skin , you\'ll hear your doctor call it a ""cutaneous porphyria."" When the condition causes a problem with your nervous system , it\'s called ""acute porphyria.""', 'Porphyria Causes No matter what kind of porphyria you have, it has the same root cause: a problem with how your body makes a substance called heme. Heme is part of the ""hemoglobin"" in your blood -- proteins that carry oxygen from the lungs to the rest of your body. Heme has iron and gives blood its red color. It\'s made in your liver and bone marrow -- the spongy center of your bones. A variety of enzymes play a role in the process. If you have porphyria, your body doesn\'t have enough of some of these enzymes. This shortage leads to a buildup of certain chemicals, called porphyrins, that help make heme.', 'The type of porphyria you have is linked to the specific enzyme that your body lacks. Most types of porphyria are inherited. That means one or both of your parents passes a mutated gene to you that leads to the disease. One common type of cutaneous porphyria, known as porphyria cutanea tarda, is sometimes passed through genes but can also be what doctors call an ""acquired disease."" In that case, certain conditions or actions can trigger symptoms of porphyria.

You may also need to get a type of sugar called glucose, which you might take by mouth or get put into your veins through an IV. Your doctor may also give you a shot of hemin ( Panhematin )."", 'If you have cutaneous porphyria, your treatment will depend on the specific type of the disease you have and how severe your symptoms are. If you have porphyria cutanea tarda, your treatment might include: Regular removal of your blood to lower the amount of iron in your liver. This is called phlebotomy . Low doses of the antimalarial drug chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine Your doctor may suggest that you avoid anything that triggers an outbreak. They will also treat conditions you have that bring on porphyria, like HIV or hepatitis C. Doctors for porphyria There are many things you can do to prevent outbreaks and manage your symptoms. You will likely need care from a team of health care professionals.

38,What to Know About Molar Pregnancy,"[""What Is Molar Pregnancy? A molar pregnancy is a complication in which an abnormal mass or tumor forms inside your uterus, instead of a placenta. In a healthy pregnancy, the placenta is an organ that grows in the uterus and nourishes a developing baby through the umbilical cord. With a molar pregnancy, the embryo can't develop. This results in the loss of the pregnancy, usually through a miscarriage. Molar pregnancy is a type of gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD). These are rare conditions in which tumors grow in your uterus during early pregnancy. They stem from abnormal changes in the trophoblast, a layer of cells that surrounds an embryo shortly after conception. Your doctor might call a molar pregnancy a hydatidiform mole (HM)."", ""Types of Molar Pregnancy There are two types of molar pregnancy, partial and complete. Partial molar pregnancy In a partial molar pregnancy, both the placenta and embryo (fertilized egg) are abnormal. It usually happens after an egg is fertilized by two sperm. A fetus may develop, but it can't survive. This type is sometimes called an incomplete molar pregnancy. Complete molar pregnancy In a complete molar pregnancy, there’s an abnormal placenta, but no embryo. This happens after a sperm fertilizes an egg that doesn't contain any genetic material. This type is more common than the partial type."", ""Molar Pregnancy Causes Molar pregnancies are caused by genetic problems that happen during conception. Scientists don't know exactly what causes them. Normal human cells contain 23 pairs of chromosomes, one set from each parent. These structures carry information that tells the body’s cells what to do. In a complete molar pregnancy, the egg doesn't contain any chromosomes, which results in the absence of half of the genetic material. In a partial molar pregnancy, there’s an extra set of chromosomes that comes from the father. When this happens, the fertilized egg can’t survive. It usually dies a few weeks into the pregnancy."", 'Molar Pregnancy Risk Factors In the U.S., 1 out of every 1,000 pregnancies are molar pregnancies. Things that may increase your chances include: Being younger than 20 or older than 40 Having experienced a molar pregnancy in the past Having a history of pregnancy loss Difficulty conceiving or infertility problems Being of Asian descent', ""Molar Pregnancy Symptoms Sometimes, molar pregnancy doesn't cause any symptoms. But they can include: Bleeding from your vagina in the first 3 months of pregnancy Watery brown discharge Sacs (they look like clusters of grapes) that pass out of your vagina Nausea and vomiting that happen more often or are worse than what’s normal during pregnancy Lots of pressure or pain in your pelvis More swelling in the belly area than expected for your stage of pregnancy Preeclampsia (high blood pressure) Anemia, in which your body has too few red blood cells Very high levels of the pregnancy hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) Cysts on your ovaries An overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism) Call your doctor if you notice any unusual symptoms during pregnancy."", ""Molar Pregnancy Diagnosis You might find out you have a molar pregnancy during a routine ultrasound test. Your doctor could detect a problem through a blood test that shows your hCG levels are much higher than they should be. Or you might not know until you have a miscarriage. Molar pregnancy ultrasound An ultrasound is a device that uses sound waves to look inside your uterus. You might have a transvaginal ultrasound, in which your doctor places a wandlike device in your vagina to create the image. If you have a partial molar pregnancy, the ultrasound might show: Little amniotic fluid A fetus that's smaller than it should be A placenta that looks unusual With a complete molar pregnancy, your doctor might see No amniotic fluid No embryo A placenta that's very large and thick Cysts on your ovaries If your doctor finds you have a molar pregnancy, they may do further imaging tests, such as a CT scan or MRI, to see if the tumor has spread to other parts of your body."", 'Molar Pregnancy Treatment Molar pregnancy treatments involve removing the placental tissue to prevent complications. Your doctor may use a procedure called dilation and curettage (D&C). This is often the treatment for pregnancy loss due to any reason. During this procedure, your doctor opens your cervix with special tools and removes the tissue from your uterus.', ""Sometimes, doctors use medication for this purpose. It causes the uterus to contract and expel its contents. If you don’t want to get pregnant again, you may consider a total hysterectomy . That’s surgery to remove your uterus. If your blood type is Rh-negative, you'll get a shot of the drug Rh immunoglobulin as part of your treatment for molar pregnancy. This helps prevent complications. After the molar tissue is removed, your doctor may do blood tests several times over the next few months to see whether your hCG levels are getting back to normal."", ""Molar Pregnancy Complications Persistent gestational trophoblastic neoplasia In rare cases, tissue remains after a molar pregnancy is removed or miscarried. The abnormal tissue may grow outside your uterus and into the layer of muscle below it. This condition is called persistent gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) . It's more likely with complete molar pregnancies."", ""To treat persistent GTN, you may need to receive chemotherapy (“ chemo ”) or have a hysterectomy. Choriocarcinoma A molar pregnancy can also lead to a type of cancer called choriocarcinoma, which can spread to other areas of your body. This is rare but more likely to happen with a complete molar pregnancy than a partial one. Your doctor can treat choriocarcinoma with chemo or radiation. Other complications Some other complications are possible, including: Preeclampsia (high blood pressure) Shock (low blood pressure) Infection in your uterus Blood infection (sepsis) Does a molar pregnancy cause infertility? Molar pregnancy doesn't affect your fertility. But after a molar pregnancy, your doctor might recommend that you don’t conceive for up to a year. Pregnancy increases hCG levels, so it would be hard for them to know whether the rise in hormones is due to that, abnormal tissue that’s still in your body, or choriocarcinoma."", 'Molar Pregnancy Prevention The only way to be certain you won’t have a molar pregnancy is not to get pregnant . If you’ve had a molar pregnancy in the past, talk to your doctor. Ask them about the chances of it happening again. And find out how you’ll be monitored if you do get pregnant .', ""Takeaways Molar pregnancy is when an abnormal clump of cells develops in your uterus, rather than a placenta. This means the embryo can't develop. Molar pregnancy often ends in miscarriage. But if that doesn't happen, it requires treatment to avoid complications."", ""Molar Pregnancy FAQs How serious is a molar pregnancy? If you miscarry a molar pregnancy or have been successfully treated for one, you're not likely to have serious issues. Rarely, you could develop serious complications, including a type of cancer called choriocarcinoma. But the complications can often be successfully treated. Can you still have a baby with a molar pregnancy? A molar pregnancy cannot develop into a baby. But having a molar pregnancy doesn't prevent you from conceiving and having a healthy pregnancy in the future. How long can you carry a molar pregnancy? If you have a partial molar pregnancy, the embryo can generally survive no longer than 3 months. If you don't have a miscarriage, your doctor will need to do a procedure or give you medication to remove it from your body. Prompt treatment is important to avoid complications.""]"

Use the fabric fastener to make the cuff snug but not too tight.', 'Place the stethoscope in your ears if you are using a manual monitor . Tilt the ear pieces slightly forward to get the best sound. 3. Inflate and deflate the cuff. If you are using a manual monitor: Hold the pressure gauge in your left hand and the bulb in your right. Close the airflow valve on the bulb by turning the screw clockwise. Inflate the cuff by squeezing the bulb with your right hand. You may hear your pulse in the stethoscope. Watch the gauge. Keep inflating the cuff until the gauge reads about 30 points above your expected systolic pressure. At this point, you should not hear your pulse in the stethoscope. Keeping your eyes on the gauge, slowly release the pressure in the cuff by opening the airflow valve counterclockwise. The gauge should fall only 2 to 3 points with each heartbeat. (You may need to practice turning the valve slowly.) Listen carefully for the first pulse beat. As soon as you hear it, note the reading on the gauge. This reading is your systolic pressure (the force of the blood against the artery walls as your heart beats). Continue to slowly deflate the cuff. Listen carefully until the sound disappears. As soon as you can no longer hear your pulse, note the reading on the gauge. This reading is your diastolic pressure (the blood pressure between heartbeats). Allow the cuff to completely deflate.', ""You'll get the most accurate reading if your arm is held straight.

EBV spreads through bodily fluids, usually saliva , which is why you can get it through kissing . You can also get it if you share food, drinks, or silverware with a person who has it or, rarely, if an infected person coughs or sneezes near you. If someone who has mono uses an object like a fork or spoon, the virus is probably still contagious as long as the object is still moist. EBV can be spread through blood and semen . It’s unusual, but you can get mono from medical procedures such as blood transfusions and organ transplants , or through sexual contact.', 'Mononucleosis Symptoms Mono can cause different symptoms in different people. If you get EBV, you may start to have symptoms of mono within about 4 to 7 weeks. Common symptoms include: Fever Fatigue Sore throat Swollen lymph nodes Sore muscles Loss of appetite Some people have no symptoms or ones that are so mild, they don’t notice them. Most people who get mono feel better in about 2 to 4 weeks. Sometimes, fatigue can last several weeks after that. In some cases, it can take 6 months or longer for the symptoms to go away.', 'Mononucleosis Diagnosis Your doctor can usually diagnose mono based on your symptoms. They might also check for swelling in your tonsils , lymph nodes , and liver or spleen . They can confirm a mono diagnosis with blood tests including: Complete blood count ( CBC ). Your doctor will look at your white blood cells, including whether any of them are unusual or whether you have more than usual. Antibody tests . Your doctor will look for proteins that your immune system creates in response to EBV.', 'Mononucleosis Complications Complications from mono can be serious. They might include: Swollen tonsils. They might narrow your airway, making it harder to swallow or breathe through your mouth . Enlarged spleen . If it becomes severe, your spleen can burst.

You might have hepatitis or jaundice . Blood problems. Your body might destroy too many of your red blood cells ( hemolytic anemia ). Or your blood might not have enough platelets ( thrombocytopenia ). Heart problems. Your heart muscle might become inflamed ( myocarditis ), or you might have an uneven heartbeat. Nervous system problems. This can include seizures , brain inflammation ( encephalitis ), or inflammation of the tissues covering your brain ( meningitis ). You’re more likely to have serious complications from mono if your immune system is weakened because of an illness like HIV or AIDS , or because you take certain medications .', 'Mononucleosis Treatment No medications treat mono. Antibiotics and antivirals don’t work on EBV. Things that may help you feel better include: Lots of rest Lots of fluids Over-the-counter pain relievers, like acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, for fever and pain Corticosteroid medication for swelling in your throat', 'Mononucleosis Prevention There’s no vaccine to prevent mono. EBV can stay in your saliva for months after you’re infected, so even if you don’t have symptoms or feel sick, you may be able to spread it. To lower your chances of getting mono, wash your hands often and try not to share things like drinks, silverware, or toothbrushes with other people.']"

In fact, it’s quite the opposite, and it can sometimes indicate an underlying problem such as depression or anxiety. There is no one cause of a nervous breakdown. Anything that leads to excessive stress can trigger it. In general, feeling stress and being unable to cope with it may lead to feeling so overwhelmed that you can’t perform your normal daily functions. Some things that might trigger a nervous breakdown include: A sudden tragedy A major life change Constant stress at work (sometimes referred to as “burnout”) Anxiety Depression Poor sleep Abuse Financial problems', 'Experiencing some stress is a normal part of life. When the feelings become too overwhelming, they can contribute to a mental breakdown. While these breakdowns can be scary and debilitating, there are things that you can do. Recognizing the signs, taking preventative action, and getting treatment can help.', 'Signs of a Nervous Breakdown A nervous breakdown leads to the inability to function normally, at least temporarily. Several signs, however, can indicate that you, or someone you know, might be on the path toward experiencing overwhelming stress. Here are some of the signs and symptoms to watch out for: Feeling Symptoms of Anxiety or Depression Anxious or depressive feelings and actions are common responses to stress . These include: Low self-esteem Fearfulness Irritability Worrying Feeling helpless Getting angry easily Withdrawing from family and friends Losing interest in your favorite activities Difficulty breathing Uncontrollable crying Thoughts of self-harm or suicide When the stress becomes unbearable, it can lead to a nervous breakdown.', 'Trouble Concentrating Studies have shown that stress affects both your mind and your body. Long-term stress can lead to structural changes in the brain, which can affect your memory and lead to difficulty concentrating. In extreme cases, too much cortisol can even lead to memory loss. Insomnia For some people, excessive stress may cause insomnia, making it difficult to fall asleep and stay asleep. When you can’t sleep, your brain and body can’t recover from stress, which, in turn, can lead to worsening stress and anxiety. A lack of sleep can also affect your physical health as well as your mental performance . Others may respond to stress by oversleeping, which may also lead to mental and physical problems. Extreme Fatigue Too much stress may leave you feeling extreme fatigue. You may feel tired because you’re not sleeping enough, or you may even feel tired because you’re sleeping too much. Over time, chronic exhaustion along with stress can lead to a mental breakdown.', 'Changes in Appetite Stress can bring about changes in your appetite. Some people deal with stress by overeating, which can lead to unwanted weight gain. For others, stress can lead to appetite loss. Digestive Issues Stress and anxiety can lead to stomach issues like cramps, bloating, constipation, and diarrhea. If you have irritable bowel syndrome , stress may trigger flare-ups, which can cause digestive discomfort. If you’re stressed and starting to notice any of these symptoms, it could be a sign that you’re on your way to a nervous breakdown. Hallucinations In some instances, extreme stress can even cause hallucinations. You might hear or see things that aren’t really there.', 'Treating a Nervous Breakdown It’s not uncommon to feel overwhelmed by life’s demands. If you’re beginning to feel as though your stress is becoming too much, talk to your doctor. They may refer you to a psychologist or psychiatrist .\xa0Your doctor may also be able to provide treatment for the physical symptoms. The right treatment for a nervous breakdown depends mainly upon its cause and the individual. Some common treatments include:', 'Lifestyle Changes Mental fatigue is a common feature of a mental breakdown. For some, getting rest and de-stressing can be an effective home remedy. Changes might include such things as: Reducing your number of daily obligations Taking a walk or adding some form of exercise to your routine Eating a healthful diet Taking a break when you need it Practicing meditation Spending time in nature Medication Your doctor may prescribe antidepressants or anti-anxiety medication to help with the symptoms of a nervous breakdown. If your stress is causing insomnia, you may be prescribed a sleep aid. Disruptions in sleep can worsen stress and anxiety, which only worsen your insomnia. Sleep aids can help to break the sleeplessness cycle and reduce your stress. Psychotherapy Also known as “talk therapy,” psychotherapy helps you to work through your nervous breakdown and reduces your risk of experiencing another one. Speaking with a professional can help you to process your thoughts and create solutions that alleviate your stress and anxiety .']"
44,Turner Syndrome,"['What Is Turner Syndrome? Turner syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that’s found only in girls. It can cause problems ranging from short height to heart defects. Sometimes, the symptoms are so mild that it doesn’t get diagnosed until a female is a teen or young adult. The condition can cause symptoms throughout your life, but treatments and continued research help people manage their condition.', 'Turner Syndrome Causes Turner syndrome happens when a female is missing certain genes that are normally on the X chromosome. (Females have two X chromosomes. Males have an X and a Y). Some girls with Turner are actually missing a whole copy of the X chromosome. For others, just part of one containing the particular set of genes is missing. The different ways genes can be affected include: Monosomy . A problem with the mom’s egg or dad’s sperm causes an absence of the X chromosome in every cell of the body. Mosaicism . When cell division during early stages of fetal development doesn’t happen correctly, some cells in the body get two complete copies of the X chromosome. Other cells have only one copy.', 'X chromosome abnormalities . Cells have one complete copy and one abnormal or missing copy of the X chromosome. Y chromosome material . In a few cases, some cells get one copy of the X chromosome and other cells get one copy of the X chromosome and some Y chromosome material. Biologically, you develop as a female. The Y chromosome material increases your risk of a type of cancer called gonadoblastoma. About 70,000 U.S. women and girls live with it. Research has found that almost 99% of babies missing the chromosome are miscarried. But about 1% of the time, these babies are born, and they have the syndrome.', 'Symptoms of Turner Syndrome Signs of Turner syndrome can start even before birth, and they give parents some idea that their baby might be born with the condition. An ultrasound of a baby with it may show heart and kidney problems or a buildup of fluid.', 'A DNA test using a blood sample from the mother can also screen for Turner syndrome before birth.', 'At birth or during infancy, girls might have a number of physical features that point to the condition. Swollen hands and feet or smaller than average height at birth are among them. Others include: A wide or weblike neck with extra folds of skin Receding or small lower jaw and a high, narrow roof of the mouth (palate) Low-set ears and a low hairline Broad chest with widely spaced nipples Arms that turn outward at the elbows Short fingers and toes and narrow fingernails and toenails Delayed growth Heart defects Down-turning eyelids Short roots of teeth Kidney abnormalities Greater than usual number of moles on the skin In older females, throughout the lifespan, symptoms can continue. They can include: No growth spurts at expected times in childhood A shorter height than might be expected based on parents’ height Learning disabilities Inability to go through puberty normally (because of ovarian failure) Loss of menstrual cycles Infertility', 'Turner Syndrome Complications Beginning at birth and continuing throughout a person’s life, Turner syndrome can be linked with other health conditions. They might include: Heart problems because of its physical structure Increased chance of diabetes and high blood pressure Hearing loss Kidney problems that can raise the chance of high blood pressure and urinary tract infections Immune disorders such as diabetes , inflammatory bowel disease , and hypothyroidism (when your thyroid gland can’t make enough hormone to keep your body running as it should) Bleeding in the digestive tract Dental and vision problems Scoliosis , which is a curving of the spine , and osteoporosis , which causes brittle bones Learning disabilities High blood pressure Mental health issues Obesity Women with Turner have trouble conceiving. If you’re able to become pregnant , high blood pressure and gestational diabetes might be issues.', 'Turner Syndrome Diagnosis If an ultrasound shows something abnormal while you’re pregnant, your doctor may want to examine your baby’s chromosomes with a karyotype. This test compares chromosomes by lining them up. To get samples from you, your doctor may recommend: Amniocentesis. This is when protective fluid that surrounds a baby is taken from your uterus. Blood sample. This can help find out whether the baby is missing all or part of an X chromosome. Chorionic villus sampling (CVS). Your doctor removes tissue samples from a portion of the placenta for testing. This test is typically done around 10-12 weeks of pregnancy. Cheek scraping or skin sample. Your doctor may be able to test you using cells scraped from the inside of your cheek (buccal smear), or a sample of skin cells. If a diagnosis isn’t made before or at birth, other lab tests that check hormones, thyroid function and blood sugar can help diagnose it. Because of the problems linked to Turner syndrome, doctors will also often suggest tests for the kidneys, heart, and hearing.', 'Turner Syndrome Treatments Medical care often calls for a team of specialists that’s built around the specific needs of each person, because the cases vary so widely. There’s no cure, but most girls will take the same main therapies during childhood and the teen years. These are: Growth hormone , given as an injection a few times a week, to increase height as much as possible. Estrogen therapy, beginning around the time of puberty until a woman reaches the average age of menopause . This hormone treatment can help a woman grow and reach adult sexual development. Almost all women with the condition need fertility treatments to become pregnant. And carrying a child can come with health risks. If you have Turner syndrome, you should discuss those issues with your doctor.']"
45,Syringomyelia,"['What Is Syringomyelia? Syringomyelia is a long-term condition that causes fluid-filled cysts , which doctors call “syrinx,” to form inside your spinal cord. You may also hear it called hydromyelia, syringohydromyelia, or Morvan disease. You may not have symptoms, or even be aware that you have it. But a severe case can cause problems that need to be treated. Syringomyelia is most common in adults ages 20 to 40, but it can happen to people of all ages. Men are more likely to get it than women.', 'Syringomyelia Symptoms Symptoms depend on the location and size of the cyst . Over time, if it grows wider and longer, it can damage the nerves in the center of your spinal cord. This can lead to chronic pain that’s hard to treat. Symptoms usually happen slowly over many years. But they can appear suddenly after an accident, like a fall. Other symptoms you may have include: Curving of the spine , called scoliosis Changes in or loss of bowel and bladder function Heavy sweating Not being able to feel hot and cold in the fingers, hands, arms, and upper chest Loss of reflexes Muscle stiffness that may make it hard to walk Muscle weakness, especially in the arms, hands, and shoulders Feeling numbness, tingling, burning, or piercing Pain in the neck, shoulders, and sometimes arms and hands Paralysis (in severe cases) Headaches Sexual problems Swings in blood pressure levels Twitches , or involuntary muscle contractions Uncoordinated movements If the cyst damages a nerve that controls the muscles in your eyes and face, you may get what doctors call Horner syndrome . It causes droopy eyelids, narrowing of the opening between the eyelids, reduced pupil size, and decreased sweating on the affected side of the face.', 'Syringomyelia Causes You get this condition when something blocks the normal flow of cerebrospinal fluid, which protects your spinal cord and brain . It enters the central canal of the spinal cord and can cause a cyst to form. With syringomyelia, there are two main reasons this fluid can get blocked or rerouted: a birth defect or trauma.', 'Congenital syringomyelia, also called communicating syringomyelia, usually happens when there’s a problem with the baby ’s brain development during pregnancy . A defect that doctors call a “Chiari I malformation” causes the lower part of the baby ’s brain to push downward into their spinal canal. This blocks the normal flow of fluid between the spine and the brain, and a cyst forms. But not everyone with a Chiari I malformation gets this disorder. Symptoms usually show up between ages 25 and 40. Acquired syringomyelia, also called primary spinal or noncommunicating syringomyelia, is when a cyst forms in a damaged part of the spinal cord. It may happen when there is: Swelling of the covering of the spinal cord Meningitis Spinal cord injury Spinal tumor Tethered spinal cord Sometimes, it happens for reasons doctors don’t understand. They call this “idiopathic syringomyelia.”', 'Syringomyelia Diagnosis Doctors use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the brain and spine to see if you have syringomyelia. The MRI can show a cyst or other condition. Sometimes, doctors discover you have this condition when doing an MRI for another health reason. You might also have a kind of X-ray procedure called a CT scan of your spine.', 'Syringomyelia Treatment What kind of treatment you get for syringomyelia depends on whether you have symptoms, and how serious they are. Monitoring : You probably won’t need treatment if you don’t have symptoms or if they’ve mild. But you should have regular checkups to watch for cyst growth and changes in signs and symptoms. The doctor may tell you to avoid activities like heavy lifting that involve straining. They might also prescribe medicine for pain or refer you to physical therapy . Surgery: If your symptoms cause problems, you may need surgery to restore the normal flow of the cerebrospinal fluid. The type of surgery you’ll have depends on what caused your syringomyelia. For example, if the problem is due to a Chiari I malformation, your doctor might do a procedure called posterior fossa decompression. They’ll remove the bone at the back of your skull and spine. It creates more space for your brainstem and cerebellum, the part of the brain that controls your movements and balance. Talk to the doctor about the risks and benefits of surgery.', 'Syringomyelia Outlook Surgery for syringomyelia doesn’t always fix the problem. Fluid can build up again. And sometimes, the damage to your nerves and spinal cord is permanent. You’ll need regular follow-ups with your doctor, including MRIs, to check whether the cyst has come back.']"
46,Why Do I Get Motion Sickness?,"['The ancient Greeks and Romans knew about motion sickness. Even NASA has made note of it. So if you have this common ailment, you’re part of a long tradition. There are ways to prevent or treat it to keep your travels or trip to the amusement park a pleasant one.', 'What Causes It? You get motion sickness when there are conflicts among your senses. Say you’re on a ride at the fair, and it’s spinning you around and upside down. Your eyes see one thing, your muscles feel another, and your inner ears sense something else. Your brain can’t take in all those mixed signals. That’s why you end up feeling dizzy and sick.', 'The Role of the Ears Your inner ears , in particular, help control your sense of balance. They are part of a network called the vestibular system. This system includes three pairs of semicircular canals and two sacs, called the saccule and the utricle. They send information about what’s going on around you to the brain . The semicircular canals hold a fluid that moves with the turns of your head. The saccule and utricle are sensitive to gravity. They tell the brain whether you’re standing up or lying down.', 'The Role of the Brain Your brain takes in all this data, and it usually comes together and makes sense. But sometimes your brain gets confusing signals. On a flying plane, for example, you feel like you’re moving, but your eyes tell your brain that you don’t appear to be going anywhere. The opposite is true as well. After a long sea voyage, you can stand still on dry land but still feel like you’re moving. The result is the same: motion sickness.', 'Who Gets It? Anybody can get motion sickness, but it’s most common in children and pregnant women. Unlike a cold , you can’t spread it to other people. It’s not contagious.', 'Symptoms Motion sickness can strike quickly and make you break out in a cold sweat and feel like you need to throw up. Other common symptoms include: Dizziness Increase in saliva production Loss of appetite Pale skin In addition, some people get headaches , feel very tired , or have shallow breathing .', 'Tips to Ease It For most people, symptoms usually don’t last long. They often go away once you get used to the situation, whether it’s the rocking of a boat or the movement of a train. But there are some simple things you can do if the motion sickness isn’t going away on its own: Relax. Find something to focus on, whether it’s taking deep breaths or counting backwards from 100. Closing your eyes can help, too. Look at a stable object. If you’re on a boat, look at the horizon. If you’re in a car, look through the windshield. Avoid alcohol . Eat lightly before travel but don’t fast. Breathe fresh air -- and don’t smoke. Avoid reading. If you can, get a seat over the wing if you’re flying, an upper-deck cabin if you’re sailing, or a front-seat spot if you’re in a car.', 'Natural Remedies Some people feel like they get relief with these:', 'Raw ginger . There’s some scientific proof that this root, long used as a folk remedy to fight nausea , is effective. But it may act as a blood thinner . Talk to your doctor first before you use it. Mint. Eating peppermint is thought to calm the body. At the very least, the aroma may soothe you. Acupuncture and acupressure . Some people say that stimulating a certain point just below the wrist helps ease their nausea .', 'Medications If you’re still bothered by motion sickness, you can talk to your doctor about these: Dimenhydrinate ( Dramamine ). This over-the-counter antihistamine , used to ease allergies , helps with motion sickness, too. The first dose should be taken about an hour before traveling. More doses are taken every 4 to 6 hours. Scopolamine ( Maldemar ). This is a prescription medication . Your wear a patch behind the ear . You apply it 4 hours before needed. A dose lasts 3 days. Other drugs include: Cyclizine ( Marezine , Marzine, Emoquil) Meclizine ( Antivert , Bonine ) Promethazine ( Phenadoz , Phenergan , Promethegan ) All have side effects, including drowsiness and dry mouth .', 'When Should I See a Doctor? Motion sickness usually goes away once the journey is over. But if you’re still dizzy, have a headache , continue to vomit, notice hearing loss or chest pain , call your doctor.']"
47,What Are Motor Neuron Diseases?,"['When you take a walk, talk to a friend, or chew a piece of food, motor neurons are behind these movements. Just like other parts of your body, they can become damaged. You may have heard of ALS, commonly known as Lou Gehrig’s disease. It’s one kind of motor neuron disease, and there are several other lesser-known types.', ""What Are Motor Neurons? They are a type of nerve cell, and their job is to send messages around your body so you can move. You have two main kinds: Upper motor neurons are in your brain. They send messages from there to your spinal cord. Lower motor neurons are in your spinal cord. They transmit the messages sent from your brain to your muscles. As nerve cells die when you have a motor neuron disease, electrical messages can't get from your brain to your muscles. Over time, your muscles waste away. You may hear a doctor or nurse call this “atrophy.” When this happens, you lose control over movements. It gets harder to walk, talk, swallow, and breathe. Each kind of motor neuron disease affects different types of nerve cells or has a different cause. ALS is the most common of these diseases in adults. Here's a look at some of the types of motor neuron diseases."", 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) ALS affects both your upper and lower motor neurons. With ALS, you gradually lose control over the muscles that help you walk, talk, chew, swallow, and breathe. Over time, they weaken and waste away. You may also have stiffness and twitches in your muscles. Most of the time, ALS is what doctors call “sporadic.” This means anyone can get it. Only about 5% to 10% of cases in the United States run in families. ALS usually starts between the ages of 40 and 60.\xa0 Most people with the disease live for 3 to 5 years after their symptoms start, yet some people can live for 10 years or longer.', ""Primary Lateral Sclerosis (PLS) PLS is similar to ALS, but it affects only upper motor neurons. It causes weakness and stiffness in the arms and legs, a slowed walk, and poor coordination and balance. Speech also becomes slow and slurred. Like ALS, it usually starts in people 40 to 60 years old. The muscles get stiffer and weaker over time. But unlike ALS, people don't die from it."", 'Progressive Bulbar Palsy (PBP) This is a form of ALS. Many people with this condition will eventually develop ALS. PBP damages motor neurons in the brain stem, which is at the base of your brain. The stem has motor neurons that help you chew, swallow, and speak. With PBP, you might slur your words and have trouble chewing and swallowing. It also makes it hard to control emotions. You may laugh or cry without meaning to.', 'Pseudobulbar Palsy This is similar to progressive bulbar palsy. It affects motor neurons that control the ability to talk, chew, and swallow. Pseudobulbar palsy causes people to laugh or cry with no control.', 'Progressive Muscular Atrophy This form is much less common than ALS or PBP. It can be inherited or sporadic. Progressive muscular atrophy mainly affects your lower motor neurons. Weakness usually starts in your hands and then spreads to other parts of the body. Your muscles get weak and may cramp. This disease can turn into ALS.', ""Spinal Muscular Atrophy This is an inherited condition that affects lower motor neurons. A defect in a gene called SMN1 causes spinal muscular atrophy. This gene makes a protein that protects your motor neurons. Without it, they die. This causes weakness in the upper legs and arms, and in the trunk. SMA comes in different types that are based on when symptoms first appear: Type 1 (also called Werdnig-Hoffmann disease). It starts around age 6 months. Children with this type can't sit on their own or hold up their head. They have weak muscle tone, poor reflexes, and trouble swallowing and breathing. Type 2. It starts between 6 and 12 months. Kids with this form can sit, but they can't stand or walk alone. They may also have trouble breathing. Type 3 (also called Kugelberg-Welander disease). It starts between ages 2 and 17. It affects how a child can walk, run, stand up, and climb stairs. Kids with this type may also have a curved spine or shortened muscles or tendons around their joints. Type 4. It usually starts after age 30 . People with this type may have muscle weakness, shaking, twitching, or breathing problems. It mainly affects muscles in the upper arms and legs."", ""Kennedy's Disease It’s also inherited, and it affects only males. Females can be carriers but don’t get ill from it. A woman with the Kennedy’s disease gene has a 50% chance of passing it on to a son. Males with Kennedy's disease have shaking hands, muscle cramps and twitches, and weakness in their face, arms, and legs. They may have trouble swallowing and speaking. Men can have enlarged breasts and a low sperm count."", 'Living With a Motor Neuron Disease The outlook is different for each type of motor neuron disease. Some are milder and progress more slowly than others. Although there is no cure for motor neuron diseases, medicines and therapy can ease symptoms and improve your quality of life.']"
48,What Are Ticks and What Diseases Do They Spread?,"['You might already know that ticks cause Lyme disease . And maybe you’ve heard they can give you Rocky Mountain spotted fever , too. But these critters don’t stop there. In fact, they’re second only to mosquitoes in spreading disease to humans. Ticks are related to spiders, so they have eight legs. They have flat, oval bodies that swell when they eat. And they feed on the blood of all kinds of animals, from birds to deer to humans. They’re also very small. Even adult ticks are only about the size of an apple seed, unless they’ve just fed. That means they’re hard to spot, which is partly why they’re so good at passing along illnesses without getting caught.', 'Do All Ticks Spread Disease? Mostly, it’s these ticks that gives illnesses to people: American dog tick, also called a wood tick Blacklegged tick, also called a deer tick Brown dog tick Gulf Coast tick Lone star tick Rocky Mountain wood tick Western blacklegged tick', 'Where Do They Live? You can find at least one kind of disease-carrying tick just about anywhere in the United States, though some places have more than others. And the various regions of the country have different types, which carry different diseases. For example, Lyme disease is mostly a problem in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic area, and Upper Midwest. Ticks make their homes in wooded areas with lots of shrubs, tall grasses and weeds, and leaf litter -- all good places from which to latch on to animals walking by. They’ll settle down in overgrown patches in your yard, woodpiles, and even bird feeders.', 'Who’s Likely to Be Bitten? It’s not just the outdoorsy types who get exposed. In fact, most people with Lyme disease got their bite while playing, gardening, or doing yardwork right outside their houses. Ticks can also hitch a ride on animals, such as pets or mice, and drop off when they pass through your yard. If you live in an area with ticks, you have a chance of being bitten.', 'What Diseases Do They Spread? Ticks spread disease by passing along bacteria, viruses, and parasites (organisms that feed off their hosts). Most of these illnesses give you the typical flu-like symptoms, such as chills, fever, headache , and muscle aches. Anaplasmosis: In the Northeast and Upper Midwest, you get this illness from the blacklegged tick. On the West Coast, it’s from the western blacklegged tick. It gives you the typical symptoms, and it’s treated with antibiotics . Babesiosis : Another disease from the blacklegged tick in the Northeast and Upper Midwest, this time you get parasites in your red blood cells . It can be life-threatening if you are elderly, had your spleen removed, or have a weak immune system. Borrelia Mayamotoi: Once again, you get this from blacklegged ticks in the Northeast and Upper Midwest. You may get joint pain along with flulike symptoms. It’s treated with antibiotics . Colorado Tick Fever : Caused by the Rocky Mountain wood tick, you can get this in Rocky Mountain states at heights of 4,000 to 10,500 feet. You may get a fever for several days, then feel fine for a while, then have a fever for a few more days. For most, it’s a mild illness.', 'Ehrlichiosis: The lone star tick in the south-central and eastern United States causes this one. You get the typical symptoms and, sometimes, a rash . It’s treated with antibiotics. Heartland virus: This is a newer illness found largely in the Midwestern, Northeastern, and Southern United States. You can get it from lone star ticks. Lyme disease: Probably the most widely known disease from ticks, you get Lyme from blacklegged ticks in the Upper Midwest, Mid-Atlantic States. and the Northeast and the western blacklegged tick on the West Coast. In the United States, the tick can give you two different bacteria, each of which causes Lyme disease. Early on, you may get the telltale bull’s-eye rash along with flulike symptoms. If you don’t treat Lyme disease, it can lead to severe problems, such as: Brain and nervous system problems Joint pain that doesn’t go away Heart issues Problems with memory and thinking clearly', 'It’s usually treated with antibiotics, and the sooner you start, the better. Powassan virus : This isn’t common, but you can get it from blacklegged tick and groundhog ticks in the Great Lakes region and the Northeast. It can cause memory loss , confusion, and seizures . Red meat allergy : For some people, a bite from the lone star tick -- found from Texas to New England -- causes an allergy to red meat. You may get hives , asthma , or even a severe, life-threatening reaction called anaphylaxis . Rickettsia parkeri rickettsiosis: You get this one from the Gulf Coast tick in the South and East, especially along the coast. You get a dark scab where you were bitten, and maybe a rash. It’s treated with antibiotics. Rocky Mountain spotted fever: You can get RMSF from the American dog tick, Rocky Mountain wood tick, and brown dog tick. Despite the name, it’s most common in the Southeast. It usually starts off with a bad headache and high fever . Most people then get a rash that starts on their ankles and wrists and spreads from there.', 'Doctors treat it with antibiotics. For best results, you need to start meds within 5 days of when symptoms show up. If it’s not treated, RMSF is life-threatening. It damages your small blood vessels, which can cause swelling in the brain , heart , and lungs . Southern tick-associated rash illness (STARI): This comes from the lone star tick. The symptoms are a lot like Lyme disease -- joint pain and a similar rash. But where Lyme disease is caused by bacteria, experts don’t know what causes STARI. Tick-borne relapsing fever: While other diseases come from hard-bodied ticks, this one is from a soft-bodied type. People have gotten it in mountainous areas from California to Ohio, usually after sleeping in more rustic cabins or homes. Without antibiotics, you’ll repeat a cycle of 3 days of fever, then 7 days without. Tularemia : You get this from a dog tick, wood tick, or lone star tick pretty much anywhere across the country. The most common symptoms are high fever and an open, painful sore where you were bitten. It can be life-threatening, but it’s treatable with antibiotics. 364D rickettsiosis: This is a newer disease found in California from the Pacific Coast tick. It causes fever and a dark scab where you were bitten.']"
49,Altitude Sickness: What to Know,"['Sometimes called “mountain sickness,” altitude sickness is a group of symptoms that can strike if you walk or climb to a higher elevation, or altitude, too quickly.', 'What Causes Altitude Sickness? The pressure of the air that surrounds you is called barometric or atmospheric pressure. When you go to higher altitudes, this pressure drops and there is less oxygen available. If you live in a place that’s located at a moderately high altitude, you get used to the air pressure. But if you travel to a place at a higher altitude than you’re used to, your body will need time to adjust to the change in pressure. Any time you go above 8,000 feet, you can be at risk for altitude sickness.', 'What Are the Types of Mountain Sickness? There are three levels of altitude sickness: Acute mountain sickness (AMS) is the mildest form, and it’s very common. The symptoms can feel like a hangover -- dizziness , headache , muscle aches, nausea . High-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) is a buildup of fluid in the lungs that can be very dangerous and even life-threatening. This is the most common cause of death from altitude sickness. High-altitude cerebral edema (HACE) is the most severe form of altitude sickness and happens when there’s fluid in the brain . It, too, is life-threatening, and you need to seek medical attention right away.', 'What Are Altitude Sickness Symptoms? You might have: Headache Dizziness Nausea Vomiting Fatigue and loss of energy Shortness of breath Problems with sleep Loss of appetite Symptoms usually come on within 12 to 24 hours of reaching a higher elevation and then get better within a day or two as your body adjusts to the change in altitude. If you have a more moderate case of altitude sickness, your symptoms might feel more intense and not improve with over-the-counter medications . Instead of feeling better as time goes on, you’ll start to feel worse. You’ll have more shortness of breath and fatigue . You may also have: Loss of coordination and trouble walking A severe headache that doesn’t get better with medication A tightening in your chest If you develop a severe form of altitude sickness like HAPE or HACE, you might have: Confusion Shortness of breath even at rest Inability to walk A cough that produces a white or pink frothy substance Coma', 'Who Gets Altitude Sickness? Anyone can develop altitude sickness, no matter how fit, young, or healthy they are -- even Olympic athletes can get it. In fact, being physically active at a high elevation makes you more likely to get it. Your chance of getting altitude sickness depends on a few other things: how quickly you move to a higher elevation, how high you go up, the altitude where you sleep , and other factors. Your risk also depends on where you live and the altitude there, your age (young people are more likely to get it), and whether you’ve had altitude sickness before. Having certain illnesses like diabetes or lung disease doesn’t automatically make you more likely to develop altitude sickness. People who have sickle cell anemia, COPD, unstable angina, a high-risk pregnancy, heart failure, or cystic fibrosis are less likely to be able to tolerate the change in altitude. So are people who have had recent heart attacks or strokes.', 'How is Mountain Sickness Treated? If you get a headache and at least one other symptom linked to altitude sickness within a day or two of changing your elevation, you might have altitude sickness. For mild symptoms, you can try staying at your current altitude to see if your body adjusts. Rest, keep warm, and have plenty of liquids. Don’t go any higher until your symptoms are completely gone. If your symptoms are severe, or if mild symptoms don’t go away in a couple of days or get worse, get to a lower elevation as quickly as possible. Don’t exert yourself. Get medical help. Your doctor might listen to your chest with a stethoscope or take an X-ray of your chest or an MRI or CT scan of your brain to look for fluid. To treat HACE, you might need a steroid called dexamethasone. If you have HAPE, you will need supplemental oxygen and may need medications, as well as moving to a lower altitude.', 'How Can Altitude Sickness Be Prevented? The best way you can lower your chance of getting altitude sickness is through acclimatization. That means you let your body slowly get used to the changes in air pressure as you travel to higher elevations.', 'You’ll want to climb to higher altitudes gradually. Going slowly helps your lungs get more air through deeper breaths and allows more of your red blood cells to carry oxygen to different parts of your body. Some basic guidelines for acclimatization are: Start your journey below 10,000 feet. If you have to fly or drive somewhere that’s higher up, stop at one destination that’s lower for at least a full day before going any higher. If you do fly or drive somewhere and can’t spend time at lower elevations on the way, the drug acetazolamide can help speed up acclimatization. If you walk, hike, or climb over 10,000 feet, only go up an additional 1,000 feet per day. For every 3,000 feet you climb, rest at least a day at that height. “Climb high and sleep low”: If you have to climb over 1,000 feet in a day, make sure you come back down to a lower altitude to sleep. Drink 3-4 quarts of water every day, and make sure about 70% of your calories are coming from carbs. Don’t use tobacco , alcohol , or medications such as sleeping pills, especially for the first 48 hours. Caffeine is OK if you normally drink it. Don’t vigorously exercise for the first 48 hours. Know how to identify the first signs of altitude sickness. Move to a lower elevation right away if you start to have these symptoms.']"
50,"Oral Cancer: Risks, Symptoms, and Prevention","['Oral cancer appears as a growth or sore in the mouth that does not go away. About 50,000 people in the U.S. get oral cancer each year, 70% of them men. Oral cancer includes cancers of the lips, tongue , cheeks, floor of the mouth , hard and soft palate, sinuses , and pharynx (throat. It can be life-threatening if not diagnosed and treated early. When it is caught early, oral cancer is much easier for doctors to treat. Yet most people get a diagnosis when their condition is too advanced to treat effectively. If you see your dentist or doctor regularly and learn how to spot suspicious changes, you’ll have a much better shot at an early diagnosis.', ""What Are the Symptoms of Oral Cancer? The most common symptoms of oral cancer include: Swellings/thickenings, lumps or bumps, rough spots/crusts/or eroded areas on the lips, gums, cheek, or other areas inside the mouth Velvety white, red, or speckled (white and red) patches in the mouth $('.ua_type_mobile .article table').css('width','100%'); Unexplained bleeding in the mouth Unexplained numbness, loss of feeling, or pain/tenderness in any area of the face, mouth, or neck Persistent sores on the face, neck, or mouth that bleed easily and do not heal within 2 weeks A soreness or feeling that something is caught in the back of the throat Difficulty chewing or swallowing, speaking, or moving the jaw or tongue Hoarseness, chronic sore throat , or change in voice Ear pain Swelling or pain in your jaw. If you wear dentures , they might be uncomfortable or hard to put in. A change in the way your teeth or dentures fit together Dramatic weight loss If you notice any of these changes, contact your dentist or health care professional immediately."", ""Who Gets Oral Cancer? According to the American Cancer Society, men face twice the risk of developing oral cancer as women. Men who are over age 50 face the greatest risk. It's estimated that over 50,000 people in the U.S. received a diagnosis of oral cancer in 2019."", 'Risk factors for the development of oral cancer include: Smoking. Cigarette, cigar , or pipe smokers are six times more likely than nonsmokers to develop oral cancers. Smokeless tobacco use . Users of dip, snuff, or chewing tobacco products are 50 times more likely to develop cancers of the cheek, gums, and lining of the lips. Excessive consumption of alcohol. Oral cancers are about six times more common in drinkers than in nondrinkers. \xa0Using alcohol and tobacco together increases your chances even more. Family history of cancer. Excessive sun exposure, especially at a young age. Ultraviolet radiation from the sun can cause lip cancers. Human papillomavirus (HPV). Certain HPV strains are etiologic risk factors for Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC). Almost everyone who’s sexually active will get HPV at some point in life. A specific type of this virus is causing a growing number of otherwise healthy men under 50 to get cancers in the back of their mouths and throats from oral sex. The more people you and your partners have sex with, the bigger your risk. Age. Oral cancers can take years to grow. Most people find they have it after age 55. But more younger men are getting cancers linked to HPV. Gender. Men are at least twice as likely as women to get oral cancer . It could be because men drink and smoke more than women do. Poor diet. Studies have found a link between oral cancer and not eating enough vegetables and fruits. It is important to note that over 25% of all oral cancers occur in people who do not smoke and who only drink alcohol occasionally.', 'What Is the Outlook for People With Oral Cancer? The overall 5-year survival rate for patients with an early diagnosis of oral cavity and pharynx cancers is 84%. If the cancer has spread to nearby tissues, organs, or lymph nodes, the 5-year survival rate drops to 65%.', 'How Is Oral Cancer Diagnosed? As part of your routine dental exam, your dentist will conduct an oral cancer screening exam. \xa0Your dentist knows what a healthy mouth should look like and probably has the best chance of spotting any cancer. Experts recommend getting checked every year starting at age 18, and sooner if you start smoking or having sex.', ""More specifically, your dentist will feel for any lumps or irregular tissue changes in your neck, head, face, and oral cavity. When examining your mouth, your dentist will look for any sores or discolored tissue as well as check for any signs and symptoms mentioned above. A biopsy may be needed to determine the makeup of a suspicious-looking area. There are different types of biopsies and your doctor can determine which one is best.\xa0 Many doctors don’t use brush biopsies because while they're very easy, they still need a scalpel biopsy to confirm the results if the brush biopsy is positive.\xa0 Also there are different types of scalpel biopsies, incisional and excisional, depending whether only a piece or the whole area is needed to determine what the nature of the problem is. \xa0Some doctors perform these biopsies with lasers."", 'How Is Oral Cancer Treated? Oral cancer is treated the same way many other cancers are treated -- with surgery to remove the cancerous growth, followed by radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy (drug treatments) to destroy any remaining cancer cells.', ""What Can You Do to Prevent Oral Cancer? Scientists think that oral cancer starts when the DNA in the cells inside your mouth gets damaged. But some things, including your health habits, can make you more likely to get it. To prevent oral cancer: Don't smoke or use any tobacco products and drink alcohol in moderation (and refrain from binge drinking). Eat a well-balanced diet. Limit your exposure to the sun. Repeated exposure increases the risk of cancer on the lip, especially the lower lip. When in the sun, use UV-A/B-blocking sun protective lotions on your skin , as well as your lips. You can take an active role in detecting oral cancer early, should it occur, by doing the following: Conduct a self-exam at least once a month. Using a bright light and a mirror, look and feel your lips and front of your gums. Tilt your head back and look at and feel the roof of your mouth. Pull your checks out to view the inside of your mouth, the lining of your cheeks, and the back gums. Pull out your tongue and look at all surfaces; examine the floor of your mouth. Look at the back of your throat. Feel for lumps or enlarged lymph nodes in both sides of your neck and under your lower jaw. Call your dentist's office immediately if you notice any changes in the appearance of your mouth or any of the signs and symptoms mentioned above. See your dentist on a regular schedule. Even though you may be conducting frequent self-exams, sometimes dangerous spots or sores in the mouth can be very tiny and difficult to see on your own. The American Cancer Society recommends oral cancer screening exams every 3 years for persons over age 20 and annually for those over age 40. During your next dental appointment, ask your dentist to perform an oral exam. Early detection can improve the chance of successful treatment.""]"
51,Hunter Syndrome (MPS II),"[""What Is Hunter Syndrome (MPS II)? Hunter syndrome , also called mucopolysaccharidosis II or MPS II, is a rare disease that's passed on in families. It mainly affects boys.\xa0Their bodies can't break down a kind of sugar that builds bones, skin , tendons, and other tissue. Those sugars build up in their cells and damage many parts of the body, including the brain . Exactly what happens is different for every person. When your son has Hunter syndrome, there are things you can do to help them play, have friends, and do some of the things that other kids do, even though they may look different from their pals. Although there is no cure for Hunter syndrome, there are ways to help manage it and live with the symptoms."", ""Causes Boys with the disease can't make a certain protein because there's a problem with a small piece of their DNA, called a gene, that comes from their mother. A dad with Hunter syndrome will pass the problem gene to their daughter, but the daughter won't get the disease unless they get the gene from their mom, too. It's possible -- but very, very unlikely -- that someone could develop Hunter syndrome even though no one in their family going back has had it."", ""Symptoms When Hunter syndrome affects the brain , which is about 75% of the time, symptoms usually show up between 18 months and 4 years of age. They start about 2 years later when the disease is milder. Hunter syndrome usually affects how the boy looks: Large, round cheeks Broad nose Thick lips and a large tongue Bushy eyebrows Large head Slowed growth Thick, tough skin Short, broad hands with stiff, curled fingers They'll probably have these symptoms: Joint problems that make it hard to move Numbness, weakness, and tingling in their hands A lot of coughs , colds, and sinus and throat infections Breathing problems , including pauses in breathing at night, or sleep apnea Hearing loss and ear infections Trouble walking and weak muscles Bowel problems, such as diarrhea Heart problems, including damaged heart valves Enlarged liver and spleen Bone thickening When a boy's brain is affected, it's likely they'll have: Trouble thinking and learning by the time they are 2 to 4 years old Trouble talking Behavior problems such as a hard time sitting still or aggression Kids who have Hunter syndrome are usually cheerful and affectionate, despite the problems it can cause."", 'Getting a Diagnosis Doctors often have to rule out other medical conditions first. Your doctor may ask: What symptoms have you noticed? When did you first see them? Do they come and go? Does anything make them better? Or worse? Has anyone in your family had Hunter syndrome or another genetic disease? If the doctors can\'t find another explanation for your son\'s symptoms, they\'ll test for Hunter syndrome by checking for: High levels of that certain sugar in their urine How active the ""missing"" protein is in their blood or skin cells The abnormal gene After doctors are sure it\'s Hunter syndrome, it\'s a good idea to let extended family members know about the gene problem, too. If you\'re a pregnant woman and you know you carry the gene or you already have a child with Hunter syndrome, you can find out whether the baby you\'re carrying is affected.

It doesn't slow the disease in the brain . Bone marrow and umbilical cord blood transplants . These transplants bring cells into your child's body that can hopefully make the protein they're missing. The new cells come from either a bone marrow donor whose cells match your child's or the stem cells of umbilical cord blood from newborn babies."", ""Both of these treatments are high-risk. They're usually used only if other treatments aren't possible. They also haven't been shown to help when the brain is affected. Research is under way to find effective treatments for boys with severe Hunter syndrome."", ""Treating the symptoms. Because so many different parts of your child's body can be affected, you'll probably need to see several doctors to help you manage the condition, including: Cardiologist: a heart specialist Ear, nose, and throat specialist Eye doctor Lung specialist Mental health professional Neurologist: works with the brain and nerves Speech therapist Medication or surgery can ease some of the complications. Physical therapy can help with joint and movement issues. And occupational therapy can help you make changes at home and school to make it easier to get around and do things.

People who have this disease can have problems with how their bodies grow and work, as well as trouble with thinking and learning. They might look different, too. Many people with milder MPS I can go to school and eventually work and have families. And even for people with more severe MPS I, there are treatments to help ease their symptoms and slow down the disease. Because it affects people in so many different ways, doctors used to separate MPS I into groups: Hurler, Hurler-Scheie, and Scheie syndromes. Now they talk about a range between two forms: Severe Attenuated, or less severe', 'Causes MPS I is passed down through families. But you get it only when both parents give you a broken gene.

You could pass the gene to your children, though.', ""Symptoms Many babies with MPS I don't show any signs of the disease at first. For those with less severe MPS I, symptoms show up later in childhood. People with this form, attenuated MPS I, probably can make a tiny bit of the protein, which is why their symptoms are milder and the disease moves very slowly. Children who have the severe form usually start to have symptoms while they're still infants. They're often big when they're born and grow quickly for a year, but then stop by the time they're 3.

53,Understanding MRSA Infection,"['What Is MRSA? Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a bacteria that causes infections in different parts of the body. It\'s tougher to treat than most strains of staphylococcus aureus – or staph – because it\'s resistant to some commonly used antibiotics. Though most MRSA infections aren\'t serious, some can be life-threatening. Many public health experts are alarmed by the spread of tough strains of MRSA. It’s sometimes called a ""s uperbug "" because it\'s hard to treat.', 'MRSA Symptoms The symptoms of MRSA infection depend on where you\'ve been infected. MRSA most often appears as a skin infection, like a boil or abscess. It also might infect a surgical wound. In either case, the area would be: Swollen Red Painful Filled with pus Have yellow crusting Many people who have a staph skin infection often mistake it for a spider bite. If staph infects the lungs and causes pneumonia, you will have: Shortness of breath Fever Chills MRSA can cause many other symptoms because once it gets into your bloodstream, it can settle anywhere. MRSA can cause an abscess (inflamed tissue with pus inside) in your spleen, kidney, or spine. It can cause endocarditis (heart valve infections), osteomyelitis (bone infections),\xa0 joint infections, mastitis (infection in the breast), and infections of implanted prosthetic devices (like those used in a knee replacement, for instance). Unlike most MRSA skin infections, which can be treated in the doctor\'s office, these more serious infections will land you in the hospital. You’ll get antibiotics in an IV to help kill the infection. Very rarely, staph can result in necrotizing fasciitis, or ""flesh-eating"" bacterial infections. These are serious skin infections that spread very quickly. While frightening, very few necrotizing fasciitis cases have been reported.', ""What Causes MRSA? Garden-variety staph are common bacteria that can live in our bodies. Plenty of healthy people carry staph without being infected by it. In fact, one-third of everybody has staph bacteria in their noses. But staph can be a problem if it manages to get into the body, often through a cut. Staph is one of the most common causes of skin infections in the U.S. Usually, these are minor and don't need special treatment. Less often, staph can cause serious problems like infected wounds or pneumonia . Did You Know? About 2% of people (2 in 100) are MRSA carriers, even though most of them aren't infected. Staph can usually be treated with antibiotics. But over the decades, some strains of staph, like MRSA, have become resistant to antibiotics that once destroyed them. MRSA was discovered in 1961. It's now resistant to amoxicillin, methicillin, oxacillin, penicillin, and other common antibiotics known as cephalosporins. While some antibiotics still work, MRSA is constantly adapting. Researchers developing new antibiotics are having a tough time keeping up."", 'MSSA vs. MRSA: What’s the Difference? Another type of staph, MSSA\xa0(methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus ), is very common. The main difference between MSSA and MRSA is that MSSA is much less resistant to the antibiotics most doctors will give you. It can cause infections, though, if it gets into the body.', ""Who Gets MRSA? MRSA is spread by contact. You could get MRSA by touching another person who has it on their\xa0skin. Or you could get it by touching things that have the bacteria on them. MRSA is carried by about 2% of the population (or 2 in 100 people), although most of them aren't infected. There are two types\xa0of people who get MRSA.\xa0 One is in decline: those who get it in hospitals or other health care places. The other is on the rise: those who get it in the community. MRSA infections are common among people who have weak immune systems who are in hospitals, nursing homes, and other health care centers. Infections can appear around surgical wounds or invasive devices, like catheters or implanted feeding tubes. The Department of Health and Human Services reviews the National Action Plan to Prevent Health Care-Associated Infections regularly. Recent studies suggest that implementing existing prevention practices can lead to up to a 70 percent reduction in certain infections."", 'Community-Associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) Alarmingly, MRSA is also showing up in healthy people who have not been hospitalized. This type of MRSA is called community-associated MRSA, or CA-MRSA. CA-MRSA skin infections have been identified among some people who share close quarters or have more skin-to-skin contact. Examples are team athletes, military recruits, prison inmates, and children in day care. But more and more CA-MRSA infections are being seen in the general community, especially in certain geographic regions. CA-MRSA is also more likely to affect younger people. In a study of Minnesotans published in The Journal of the American Medical Association , the average age of people with MRSA in a hospital or health care facility was 68. But the average age of a person with CA-MRSA was only 23.', 'When to Call a Doctor In most cases, MRSA is easily treated . But MRSA infections can be serious, so make sure you get medical care. You should call your doctor if you notice signs of active infection – most likely of the skin – with a spreading, painful, red rash or abscess.', ""If you are already being treated for an infection, watch for signs your medicine isn't working. Those may include: The infection is no better after you’ve been taking the antibiotic 3 or 4 days. The rash spreads. You get a fever, or your fever gets worse. People who are sick or have weak immune systems have a higher risk of getting serious MRSA infections. If you have a condition that lowers your immunity, call your doctor right away if you think that you might have an infection.""]"
54,What Are Parkinson’s Plus Syndromes?,"['Parkinson’s plus syndromes, also called “atypical Parkinson’s,” are illnesses that attack your brain and nerve cells. As the name suggests, they’re linked to Parkinson’s disease and cause a lot of the same symptoms, but they can bring on other problems as well. Your brain makes a chemical called dopamine that helps control your movement. “Parkinsonism” is the word doctors use to describe several conditions that can happen if you don’t make enough of it. Parkinson’s disease is by far the most common of these, but about 15% of people who have a problem making dopamine will have one of the Parkinson’s plus syndromes.', 'Types Parkinson’s plus syndromes are more serious and harder to treat than “classic” Parkinson’s disease. The four main types are: Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) This is the most common Parkinson’s plus syndrome. It causes some of the same issues with movement and your muscles as Parkinson’s disease, like stiffness and problems with walking or balance, but it doesn’t usually make your limbs shake. It also can make it harder to move your eyes -- it starts in the part of your brain that controls your eye muscles. Looking down can be especially hard. It can cause mood changes, affect your ability to think of words, and make it hard to swallow as well.', 'Dementia With Lewy Bodies This is the second most common form of dementia after Alzheimer’s disease. Lewy bodies are clumps of protein that build up in your nerve cells. When that happens, it affects your ability to think clearly, speak, and remember things. It can make you confused and cause hallucinations (when you see things that aren’t there). The symptoms get worse over time. Multiple System Atrophy This affects what’s known as your autonomic nervous system, which controls things like your blood pressure and digestive system . Symptoms can include things like fainting , losing control of your bladder , and constipation . It also causes more typical Parkinson’s symptoms, like shaking, stiffness, and problems with balance or speech.', 'Corticobasal Degeneration This is the rarest of the four main types. It kills brain cells in the cerebral cortex -- the wrinkly gray matter on the outside of your brain -- and causes the cortex to shrink. It also attacks what’s called the basal ganglia, a part of your brain that controls movement. Its symptoms are like the ones caused by Parkinson’s disease, including the loss of muscle control, sometimes starting on only one side of your body. But it also can hurt your ability to think, see, and speak clearly. As the disease gets worse, it gets harder to walk and swallow.', 'Diagnosis Parkinson’s plus syndromes can look a lot like other conditions that affect your nervous system, so it can sometimes take a while to find out for sure what’s going on. If your doctor thinks you might have Parkinson’s or a Parkinson’s plus syndrome, they’ll recommend that you see a neurologist , a doctor who specializes in problems with the nervous system. Your neurologist will examine you and see how you move and follow directions. They then might suggest blood tests and a brain scan to rule out other conditions. If those don’t show a reason for your symptoms, they may ask you to try a medication called carbidopa -levodopa. Your brain can turn that into dopamine. If your symptoms get better, that may be enough for your doctor to diagnose Parkinson’s disease. If it doesn’t help much or at all, or it helps for a while then stops working, that can be a sign of a Parkinson’s plus syndrome. Other things that can point to a Parkinson’s plus syndrome rather than the classic form include: Early signs of dementia Falling often Trouble moving your eyes Your symptoms get worse then level off for a while', 'Treatment Doctors don’t know exactly what causes any of the Parkinson’s plus syndromes, and there’s no cure for them. Treating them usually is about managing the symptoms. That can include the following: Medication can help some people move more easily and feel less stiff. Some drugs also can help with the problems caused by multiple system atrophy, like fainting or constipation . A cane or walker can help you get around. Speech therapy can help you communicate better. Exercise and physical therapy can make your muscles stronger and more flexible. Occupational therapy can help make everyday tasks easier.']"
55,Lipoma,"['What Is a Lipoma? A lipoma is a lump of fat that grows in your body’s soft tissues. Though it’s classified as a tumor, it’s usually harmless. It’s the most common tumor to form beneath your skin. About 1 person out of every 1,000 will get one at some point. You most often find them in your upper body, arms, or thighs.', 'Symptoms of Lipoma They usually appear as small, soft lumps. They’re typically less than 2 inches wide. You could have more than one. When you press on the lipoma, it may feel doughy. It will move easily with finger pressure. They don’t normally hurt, but they can cause pain if they bump against nearby nerves or have blood vessels running through them.', 'Causes of Lipoma It isn’t clear what causes them. Middle-aged men and women tend to get them more. They also run in families. Lipomas often show up after an injury, though doctors don’t know whether that’s what makes them form. Inherited conditions can bring them on. Some people who have a rare condition known as Madelung’s disease can get them. This most often affects men of Mediterranean ancestry who have alcohol use disorder.', 'When to Call a Doctor If you notice a lump or swelling on your body, have a doctor check it out. They can let you know whether it’s a harmless lipoma or something that needs more tests. Lipomas can form inside muscles or internal organs, but this doesn’t happen often. If one is causing pain or affecting your muscles, you might have to get it removed. It’s rare, but a lump may be a type of cancer called a liposarcoma, which grows rapidly and can be painful. If your doctor suspects this condition, they’ll suggest more tests.', 'Lipoma Diagnosis Lipomas can usually be diagnosed with a physical exam. But you may need a biopsy, in which a small piece of the tissue is removed and looked at under a microscope, to confirm the diagnosis. Tests like X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs can also give a clearer picture.', 'Lipoma Removal and Treatment Since lipomas aren’t harmful, doctors often leave them alone. You may need to keep an eye on it between visits.', 'If one hurts or you don’t like the way it looks, you might want to have it removed. Your doctor can take it out surgically with a small cut. You’ll get a shot of medication to numb the area so it won’t hurt. You should be able to go home after it’s done. You may have to go back within a couple of weeks to get a few stitches taken out. Other possible treatments include: Steroids: This type of drug can help shrink a tumor. Liposuction : The doctor uses a needle and syringe to draw out the fatty tissue.', 'Large Lipomas Lipomas bigger than 2 inches are sometimes called giant lipomas. They can cause nerve pain , make you feel self-conscious about your looks, or change the way your clothes fit. It’s a little harder to take out one of these. The doctor will probably give you medication that will help you sleep through the procedure. You’ll need someone to drive you home afterward. Lipomas rarely come back once removed. Having one doesn’t make it more likely that you’ll get other diseases.']"
56,Autoimmune Blistering Disorders,"[""What Are Autoimmune Blistering Disorders? Autoimmune blistering disorders (also called autoimmune blistering diseases or autoimmune bullous disorders) are a group of rare skin diseases. They happen when your immune system attacks your skin and mucous membranes -- the lining inside your mouth , nose, and other parts of your body. This causes blisters to form. Researchers have found many types of this disorder. Although there's no cure for them, your doctor can give you treatments to help heal the blisters and prevent complications."", 'Types of Autoimmune Blistering Disorders Autoimmune blistering disorders are broken down into different types. These are some of the main ones: Pemphigus is a group of disorders that cause blisters to form on the skin and inside the mouth , nose, throat, eyes, and genitals. They are soft and can break open easily. Pemphigoid is another group. It has three main types: Bullous pemphigoid usually affects people between the ages of 60 and 80. It causes itchy blisters to form on the arms, thighs, and belly. Mucous membrane pemphigoid affects the lining of the mouth, eyes , nose, throat, and genitals. Pemphigoid gestationis affects women during pregnancy or just after their baby is born. It starts as a bumpy rash on the belly, arms, and legs. Then the bumps turn into blisters.', 'IgA mediated bullous dermatoses are disorders in which the immune system makes a lot of immunoglobulin A (IgA), a type of antibody that fights bacteria, toxins, and viruses. It comes in two types: Dermatitis herpetiformis affects people with celiac disease (who are sensitive to the wheat protein called gluten ). It causes clusters of itchy blisters to appear on the elbows, knees, scalp, and buttocks. Linear IgA disease causes new blisters to form a ring around old ones on the skin. This is sometimes called a “cluster of jewels.” This type affects mucous membranes, too. Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita mostly affects middle-aged and older adults. It makes the skin so fragile that blisters form from minor injuries.', 'Autoimmune Blistering Disorder Symptoms The places on your body where blisters form depends on which disorder you have. Some autoimmune blistering disorders cause blisters to grow on the skin. Other types cause them to form in the mucous membranes that line the mouth, nose, throat, eyes , and genitals. They can be painful or itchy. They can break open and leave a sore.', ""Autoimmune Blistering Disorder Causes When your immune system is working as it should, it attacks bacteria and other invaders before they can make you sick. In autoimmune blistering disorders, your system mistakes healthy cells in your skin and mucous membranes for unwanted intruders. Erythema multiforme minor appears as symmetrical rings of red, raised skin that look like targets. Erythema multiforme can appear anywhere on the body. It is most often caused by the herpes simplex virus but has been associated with fungal infections or reactions to medications. Your immune system makes proteins called antibodies. These attack the substances that hold the outer (epidermis) and inner (dermis) layers of skin together. The damage causes the two layers of skin to separate. Fluid collects between the two and forms blisters. Doctors don't know what causes the immune system to misfire. Some people have genes that make them more likely to get one of these disorders. Then, something actually triggers it, such as: Ultraviolet light from the sun Chemicals used to kill pests Hormones Infection Some medicines can also cause autoimmune blistering disorders. These include: Diuretics and other medicines for high blood pressure Rheumatoid arthritis medications Antipsychotic medicines Antibiotics such as amoxicillin ( Moxatag ), ciprofloxacin (Cetraxal, Ciloxan, Cipro ), and penicillin Usually, the blisters go away once you stop taking the medicine causing them."", 'Autoimmune Blistering Disorder Complications Blisters can cause long-term problems if they form in certain parts of the body or break open. Blisters that pop open can cause infections. After they heal, they can leave scars. In the throat or lungs , they can make it hard to eat, swallow, or breathe . In the mouth, they can cause gum disease and tooth loss. In the eyes , they can affect sight.', ""Autoimmune Blistering Disorder Diagnosis You'll see a dermatologist. They will look at your skin and see where the blisters have formed. You might get one or more of these tests: Blister biopsy . Your doctor removes a piece of the blister and looks at it under a microscope. A biopsy can show where the skin layers have separated. Direct immunofluorescence. A chemical is placed on the skin biopsy sample. Then it is tested for antibodies. The type of antibodies in your skin can show which type of blistering disorder you have. Blood test. Your doctor tests a sample of your blood for antibodies. This test can show how severe your condition is. It can also help the doctor see whether treatment is working."", 'Sometimes it’s hard to tell the difference between autoimmune blistering disorders and other conditions, including: Genetic blistering disease, a group of disorders caused by changes in a gene needed for healthy skin Grover’s disease, a rare skin disorder that can cause small red lesions and blisters Other skin conditions that cause blisters, such as erythema multiforme or impetigo', ""Autoimmune Blistering Disorder Treatment Your doctor will decide on a treatment based on your symptoms. Medicines for these disorders lower the immune system response and prevent it from attacking your skin and mucous membranes. Treatments might include prescriptions from these classes of drugs: Corticosteroids , such as prednisone ( Deltasone , Prednicot, Rayos), that also ease inflammation Immunosuppressive medicines , such as azathioprine ( Azasan , Imuran ), cyclophosphamide , or mycophenolate mofetil (CellCept) Biologic drugs, such as rituximab ( Rituxan ), also used in some cancer treatments For more serious cases, your treatments might include: Intravenous immunoglobulin G ( IVIG ). This is a blood product you get through a needle into a vein. IVIG is an antibody found in plasma -- the liquid part of blood. It's taken from thousands of donors and pooled together. IVIG treatment gives you healthy antibodies to take over for the unhealthy ones that caused your disorder. Plasmapheresis . This treatment removes the harmful antibodies from your blood. The part of blood that's removed is replaced with blood from a donor that contains healthy antibodies. Blisters that pop open can get infected. These drugs help prevent an infection: Antibiotics Antiviral drugs Antifungal drugs"", 'Autoimmune Blistering Disorder Home Care To prevent infections and help you stay more comfortable, take care of your blisters. Keep them clean the way your doctor recommends. Try not to pop them. This can leave scars. If a blister is in an uncomfortable place such as your foot , your doctor can release the fluid with a clean needle. Also: Wash your sheets, towels, and clothes often. Make sure everything that touches your skin is clean. Care for your teeth . If you have blisters in your mouth, ask your dentist how to brush your teeth and gums without causing pain and more damage. Each person with autoimmune blistering disorders is different. Some people have only mild blisters that go away on their own. Others have more severe skin problems that are harder to treat. Talk to your doctor about your situation. Try different treatments until you find one that works for you.']"
57,"Leptospirosis: Symptoms, Causes, and Treatment","['What Is Leptospirosis? Leptospirosis can cause a range of flu-like symptoms, from vomiting to diarrhea. Learn what causes the rare infection and how to avoid it. (Photo Credit: iStock/Getty Images) Leptospirosis is a rare bacterial infection we get from animals. It’s spread through their urine , especially from dogs, rodents, and farm animals. They may not have any symptoms, but they can be carriers. In most cases, leptospirosis is unpleasant but not life-threatening, like a case of the flu . It rarely lasts more than a week. But about 10% of the time, when you have a severe form of leptospirosis, you’ll get better, but then get sick again. This is called Weil’s disease, and it can cause much more serious issues, like chest pain and swollen arms and legs. It often means a trip to the hospital.', 'Leptospirosis Causes A bacteria called Leptospira interrogans causes leptospirosis. Many animals carry the organism, and it lives in their kidneys . It gets into soil and water from their urine. If you’re around soil or water where an infected animal has peed, the germ can invade your body through breaks in your skin , like scratches, open wounds, or dry areas. It can also enter through your nose, mouth , or genitals. It’s hard to get it from another person, though it can be passed through sex or breastfeeding .', ""You have a higher chance of getting the disease if you spend a lot of time around animals or outdoors. You’re more likely to be exposed to it if you have one of these jobs: Farmer Veterinarian Underground worker (you work in a sewer or a mine) Slaughterhouse worker Military personnel Also, if you raft, swim, or camp near affected lakes and rivers, you could get the disease. You'll find leptospirosis more often in warm climates. And although the bacteria lives all over the world, it’s especially common in Australia, Africa, Southeast Asia, Central and South America, and the Caribbean."", ""Leptospirosis Phases There are two phases of leptospirosis: Leptospiremic phase. During this phase, you'll suddenly have symptoms that feel a lot like the flu. They'll start a couple of days to a couple of weeks after you're first exposed to the leptospira bacteria. Symptoms can last for up to 10 days. Immune phase . Once you reach this phase, the leptospira bacteria is now in your organs, especially your kidneys. The bacteria will show up in urine tests, and your body will build up protection (antibodies) against the bacteria. It's possible that you could get sick during this phase with another illness called Weil's syndrome, which causes internal bleeding, kidney damage, and jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes)."", 'Leptospirosis Symptoms You usually start showing signs of leptospirosis within 2 weeks, though in some cases, symptoms may not show up for a month or not at all. When the disease does hit, it hits fast. You’ll get a fever . It may spike to 104 F. Other typical symptoms include: Headache Muscle ache Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes ) Vomiting Diarrhea Skin rash Many of these symptoms are similar to symptoms of other diseases, including the flu and meningitis , so it’s important to get tested.', ""Leptospirosis Diagnosis To check for leptospirosis, your doctor does a simple blood test and examines your blood for antibodies . These are proteins your body produces to fight the bacteria. If you've had the disease in your system before, the blood test may give a false positive (or show antibodies from the previous infection). So your doctor will likely do a second test about a week later to make sure the results are correct. You may also have a urine test to look for signs of the bacteria."", ""Your doctor could order a DNA test . It’s more precise, but it's more expensive and takes longer, and in many areas of the world, it’s not available yet.\xa0Doctors can also spot the bacteria if it grows in a blood, spinal fluid, or urine culture. Severe symptoms of leptospirosis may need a chest X-ray, CT scan, or other imaging. These tests will help show damage to your organs caused by the bacteria."", 'Leptospirosis Treatment Doctors can treat leptospirosis with antibiotics, including penicillin and doxycycline. Your doctor may also suggest ibuprofen for fever and muscle pain. The disease should run its course in about a week. But you may have to go to the hospital if your infection is more serious. Symptoms may include kidney failure, meningitis, and lung problems. You may need a shot of antibiotics, and in very serious cases, the infection could damage your organs. You could also need treatment for other health problems. For example, the disease can spread through your body (systemic inflammatory syndrome) and cause internal bleeding and inflame your pancreas or gallbladder. You or those around you might notice changes in your speech or behavior after the spread of this infection. It also could inflame your heart muscle (myocarditis), leading to symptoms of heart failure, including blockages and an irregular heartbeat (dysrhythmia). Your doctor will consider your other symptoms, overall health, health history, age, and other things before deciding how to treat these health problems.', 'Leptospirosis Prevention Avoid unsafe water. If you’re in a developing country, don’t drink the water unless you’re sure it’s clean. But because leptospirosis can enter through other body openings, it’s also a good idea to avoid swimming, waterskiing, sailing, or fishing in freshwater areas. Saltwater is generally safe. Keep away from infected animals, especially wild rats. Rats and other rodents are the main carriers of the bacteria. Be careful if you have to handle wild rats or come in contact with their habitats. In the developed world, farm animals are usually vaccinated, so there’s much less risk. If an animal is ill, avoid bites and body fluids. The disease can’t be passed through the air like a cold or the flu. Be aware of your surroundings, especially when you travel. In countries with poor sanitation, leptospirosis is more common and may be hard to avoid. So, know the symptoms and get help if you become ill. Use disinfectant. Bleach, Lysol, acid solutions, and iodine are deadly to the bacteria. Keep them on hand to clean up.', 'Leptospirosis in Dogs All animals can get leptospirosis. Though it used to be rare in pets, it has shown up more often in the past few years, especially in dogs. (Leptospirosis is rare in cats.) Leptospirosis in dogs happens the same way it does in people:\xa0through contact with the urine of infected animals, which can get into water or soil and survive for weeks or months. Your pet might not show any symptoms. Many of the symptoms of leptospirosis are very similar to those of other diseases, such as: Fever Belly pain, vomiting, diarrhea Weakness Pain Stiffness The only way to know for sure they have it is to ask your vet to do a test. And of course, if your pet is infected, they can pass it on to you. There is a leptospirosis vaccine available for dogs. Veterinarians recommend that any dog that goes outside at all – even just to go to the bathroom – be vaccinated against leptospirosis.']"
58,Multifocal Motor Neuropathy,"[""What Is Multifocal Motor Neuropathy? Multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) is a disease that affects your body's motor nerves. Those are the nerves that control your muscles. The condition makes it hard for them to send the electrical signals that move your body, which makes your hands and arms feel weak. They’ll also twitch and cramp . MMN is not life-threatening, and, in most cases, treatments can make the muscles stronger. The disease can get worse slowly, and after a while, you may have a hard time doing daily tasks, like typing or getting dressed. But for many people, symptoms may be so mild that they don't need treatment at all. You may be able to work and stay active for many years after your diagnosis. Most people are diagnosed with MMN in their 40s and 50s, although adults from ages 20 to 80 can find out they have the disease."", 'Causes No one knows what causes MMN. Scientists do know it’s an autoimmune disease , meaning your immune system mistakenly attacks your nerve cells as if they were invaders. Researchers are studying the disease to try to find out why it happens.', 'Symptoms If you have MMN, you’ll most likely notice the first symptoms in your hands and lower arms. Your muscles may feel weak and cramp up or twitch in a way you can’t control. It may start in specific parts of the arm or hand, like the wrist or finger. Usually the symptoms are more severe on one side of your body. The disease may eventually affect your legs. MMN isn’t painful, and you’ll still be able to feel with your hands and arms because your sensory nerves are not affected. But your symptoms will slowly get worse as you get older.', ""Getting a Diagnosis Doctors often mistake MMN for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. They have similar symptoms, like twitching. Unlike ALS, though, MMN is treatable. Your doctor may tell you to see a neurologist, a specialist who treats problems with the nervous system. They will give you a physical exam and\xa0also ask questions about your symptoms, like: Which muscles are giving you trouble? Is it worse on one side of your body? How long have you been feeling this way? Do you have any numbness or tingling? Does anything make your symptoms better? What makes them worse? The doctor will do some nerve and blood tests to rule out other conditions that might cause your symptoms. They may do: A nerve conduction study (NCS). This test measures how fast electrical signals travel through your nerves. Usually, your doctor will put two sensors on the skin over one of your nerves: one to transmit a small electric shock and the other to record the activity. The doctor will repeat the test on other nerves if they think that more than one is involved. A needle electromyography (EMG). Your doctor will put electrodes on your arms. The electrodes have small needles, which go into your muscle, and they’re attached by wires to a machine that can measure the electrical activity in your muscles. Your doctor will ask you to slowly flex and relax your arms so the machine can record the activity. The doctor can do this test at the same time as the NCS. A blood test to look for GM1 antibodies, part of your body’s immune system. Some people with MMN have higher levels of them. If you do have a lot of these antibodies, chances are you have the disease. You might have MNN even if you don't have a lot of the antibodies, though."", ""Questions for Your Doctor How will MMN affect me? Do I need treatment? What kinds are available? How will they make me feel? Will I be able to work? What happens if the treatment doesn't help? Are there any clinical trials I can join? Are there any activities I won't be able to do?"", ""Treatment If your symptoms are very mild, you may not need any treatment. If you do need treatment, your doctor will probably prescribe a medication called intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIg ). You’ll get the drug directly into one of your veins through an IV. You’ll usually get it in a doctor's office, although you can learn to do it at home. If IVIg works, you should feel your muscle strength improve within 3 to 6 weeks. The effects will wear off over time, though, so you’ll need to keep having the treatment. People usually have it once a month, but it may be more or less often depending on your condition."", ""IVIg doesn't have many side effects, but it is expensive. Doctors are testing ways to give it directly through the skin like a regular shot, but this method isn’t available for everyone. If IVIg doesn't work, your doctor may try a drug called cyclophosphamide ( Cytoxan ), which is also used to treat certain types of cancer . This drug controls symptoms by turning down your immune system. Unlike immunoglobulin, cyclophosphamide can have bad side effects, so doctors try not to use it."", 'Taking Care of Yourself If you get treatment for MMN early, you’re more likely to have few symptoms or long-term problems. Stick to your treatment plan, and talk to your doctor about any changes in how you’re feeling. If you have trouble with certain activities, you may want to see an occupational or physical therapist. They can help you keep your muscles strong and show you how to do daily tasks more easily if your muscles are bothering you.', 'What to Expect Many people with MMN can continue most or at least some of their normal activities. The disease can get worse for some people and keep them from doing daily tasks. The kind of problems you have depend on which of your muscles are affected. If your hand muscles are weak, you may have trouble eating, typing, writing, or buttoning clothes. If your leg muscles are affected, you could have trouble walking. Some people with severe MMN have trouble in all these areas.', 'Getting Support To learn more about multifocal motor neuropathy, visit the web sites of the Neuropathy Action Foundation , the Neuropathy Association , or the GBS-CIDP (Guillain-Barre Syndrome-Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy] Foundation International .']"
59,Endocrine Disorders,"[""The endocrine system is a network of glands that produce and release hormones. These hormones help control many important body functions, including the body's ability to change calories into energy that powers cells and organs. The endocrine system affects how your heart beats, how your bones and tissues grow, and even your ability to make a baby. Disorders of the endocrine system happen if your hormone levels are too high or too low, or if your body doesn't respond to hormones in the expected way. You may develop diabetes , thyroid disease, growth disorders, sexual dysfunction, and a host of other hormone-related disorders. If you experience fatigue and weakness on a regular basis, it might be a result of a hormonal imbalance causing an endocrine disorder. (Photo Credit: Cavan/Getty Images)"", 'Glands of the Endocrine System Each gland of the endocrine system releases specific hormones into your bloodstream. These hormones travel through your blood to other cells and help control or coordinate many body processes. Endocrine glands include: Adrenal glands: Two glands that sit on top of the kidneys that release the hormone cortisol. Hypothalamus: A part of the lower middle brain that tells the pituitary gland when to release hormones. Islet cells in the pancreas : Cells in the pancreas that control the release of the hormones insulin and glucagon. Ovaries: The female reproductive organs that release eggs and produce sex hormones. Parathyroid: Four tiny glands in the neck that play a role in bone development. Pineal gland : A gland located near the center of the brain that may be linked to sleep patterns. Pituitary gland: It\'s present at the base of the brain behind the sinuses . It is often called the ""master gland"" because it influences many other glands, especially the thyroid . Problems with the pituitary gland can affect bone growth, a woman\'s menstrual cycles, and the release of breast milk. Testes: The male reproductive glands that produce sperm and sex hormones. Thymus: A gland in the upper chest that helps develop the body\'s immune system early in life. Thyroid : A butterfly-shaped gland in the front of the neck that controls metabolism . Even the slightest hiccup with the function of one or more of these glands can throw off the delicate balance of hormones in your body and lead to an endocrine disorder, or endocrine disease.', ""Endocrine Disorder Causes Endocrine disorders are typically grouped into two categories: Endocrine diseases that result when a gland produces too much or too little of an endocrine hormone, called a hormone imbalance. Endocrine diseases that happen due to the development of lesions (such as nodules or tumors) in the endocrine system, which may or may not affect hormone levels. The endocrine feedback system helps control the balance of hormones in the bloodstream. If your body has too much or too little of a certain hormone, the feedback system signals the proper gland or glands to correct the problem. A hormone imbalance may occur if this feedback system has trouble keeping the right level of hormones in the bloodstream, or if your body doesn't clear them out of the bloodstream properly. Increased or decreased levels of endocrine hormone may be caused by: A problem with the endocrine feedback system Disease Failure of a gland to stimulate another gland to release hormones (for example, a problem with the hypothalamus can disrupt hormone production in the pituitary gland) A genetic disorder, such as multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) or congenital hypothyroidism Infection Injury to an endocrine gland Tumor of an endocrine gland Most endocrine tumors and nodules (lumps) are noncancerous. They usually don't spread to other parts of the body. However, a tumor or nodule on the gland may interfere with the gland's hormone production."", 'Symptoms of Endocrine Disorders The symptoms of an endocrine disorder vary widely and depend on the specific gland involved. However, most people with endocrine disease complain of fatigue and weakness. Certain symptoms may make you think you have a different disease or disorder. Some symptoms that are worth talking to your doctor about include: Changes in your heart rate Changes to your skin or eyes Bone fractures High blood sugar levels High calcium levels Low or high blood pressure Unexplained changes in your weight Loss of sex drive Infertility Menstrual cycle disorders', 'Types of Endocrine Disorders There are many different types of endocrine disorders. Diabetes is the most common endocrine disorder diagnosed in the U.S.', ""Other endocrine disorders include: Adrenal insufficiency. The adrenal gland releases too little of the hormone cortisol and sometimes, aldosterone. Symptoms include fatigue , stomach upset, dehydration , and skin changes. Addison's disease is a type of adrenal insufficiency. Cushing's disease. The overproduction of a pituitary gland hormone leads to an overactive adrenal gland. A similar condition called Cushing's syndrome may occur in people, particularly children, who take high doses of corticosteroid medications ."", ""Gigantism ( acromegaly ) and other growth hormone problems. If the pituitary gland produces too much growth hormone, a child's bones and body parts may grow abnormally fast. If growth hormone levels are too low, a child can stop growing in height. Hyperthyroidism. The thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone, leading to weight loss, fast heart rate, sweating , and nervousness. The most common cause for an overactive thyroid is an autoimmune disorder called Grave's disease. Hypothyroidism . The thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormone, leading to fatigue , constipation , dry skin , and depression. The underactive gland can cause slowed development in children. Some types of hypothyroidism are present at birth. Hypopituitarism. In this condition, the pituitary gland releases little or no hormones. It may be caused by several different diseases. Women with this condition may stop getting their periods. Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 and 2 (MEN1 and MEN2). These rare, genetic conditions are passed down through families. They cause tumors of the parathyroid, adrenal, and thyroid glands, leading to overproduction of hormones."", 'Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). The overproduction of androgens interferes with the development of eggs and their release from the female ovaries. PCOS is a leading cause of infertility. Precocious puberty . This refers to abnormally early puberty that occurs when glands tell the body to release sex hormones too soon in life.', 'Testing for Endocrine Disorders If you have an endocrine disorder, your doctor may refer you to a specialist called an endocrinologist. An endocrinologist is specially trained in problems with the endocrine system. Blood and urine tests to check your hormone levels can help your doctors determine if you have an endocrine disorder. Imaging tests may be done to help locate or pinpoint a nodule or tumor. Treatment of endocrine disorders can be complicated, as a change in one hormone level can throw off another. Your doctor or specialist may order routine blood work to check for problems or to determine if your medication or treatment plan needs to be adjusted.', 'Takeaways Your endocrine system releases hormones that affect how your body develops and functions. An endocrine system malfunction, caused by genetics, infection, or other factors, can result in various disorders such as diabetes, hyperthyroidism, and polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS).

60,Freckles,"[""What Are Freckles? Freckles are extra patches of coloring (or pigment) under your skin . Doctors call them ephelides. You have them because of the genes you were born with. Freckles are more likely if you’re light-skinned with blond or red hair. But anyone can have them—on darker skin, they’ll show up as darker brown spots. (Photo credit: Irina Bogolapova/Dreamstime) Freckles often show up during childhood, and you may continue to get more until you're in your 20s. They're most common in people with fair skin or red hair, but anyone can have them. If you have dark skin, your freckles may show up as darker brown spots. Types of freckles There are two types of freckles: ephelides and solar lentigines . Although both are flat spots, they’re different in a few ways. Ephelides: Are genetic First show up when you’re around 2-3 years old, often after you’ve been in the sun Are usually on your arms, chest, face, and neck Can be red, dark brown, or light brown Can go away as you age May fade during the winter Are usually about 1-2 millimeters or bigger Have irregular borders that aren’t very defined Solar lentigines: Are sometimes called age spots or liver spots Show up as you get older and are common if you’re 50 or older Can be anywhere on your body that gets sun, including areas like your back, chest, face, forearms, hands, and shins Don’t fade or disappear Can range from light yellow to dark brown in color Show up because of sun exposure and aging Have clear borders"", 'Freckles Causes and Risk Factors The harmful rays of the sun can make your freckles darker and easier to see. This is more likely if you have light skin. Too much sun may also cause your skin to become: Tanned Sunburned Blotchy', ""Freckle Treatment Natural freckles don't need treatment. They aren’t a sign of a skin problem . As you get older, they may get lighter on their own or go away entirely, depending on what type of freckle they are. If you don't like how your freckles look, treatments can help fade them. These include: Chemicals like alpha-hydroxy acid (AHA) and trichloroacetic acid (TCA) Laser treatments Cryotherapy (skin freezing) Chemical peels Creams like retinol, a form of vitamin A A dermatologist will need to decide which treatment is best for you. You should see a doctor if your freckles: Have jagged borders Aren’t symmetrical Are sore Have a diameter of more than 6 millimeters (about the size of a pencil eraser) Become raised off of your skin Have dark patches or multiple colors Start to grow or change size or colors"", 'Freckle Prevention You can avoid getting more freckles by protecting yourself from the sun. Some of the best ways are: Always wear a water-resistant sunscreen with broad-spectrum protection and an SPF of 30 or higher (even when it’s not sunny). Never use tanning beds. Don’t get sunburned. Stay in the shade, especially from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.', ""Freckles vs. Sunspots You may confuse freckles for lentigines, which are also called age spots or liver spots. They can look tan, brown, or black and are common in people who are 50 or older. You can get them if you're younger, though. Solar lentigines appear in areas of your body that get the most sun, but less light won't make them fade. As you age, you'll have more of them. (Photo credit: Richard Usatine, MD) Sunspots are caused by too much pigment stuck together in one area of your skin. This can happen after many years of spending a lot of time in the sun. Tanning beds can cause sunspots, too. If you have sunspots, you could also see: More spots on parts of your body that get sunlight (like your hands, feet , face, and shoulders) Spots as large as a half-inch across Sunspots are harmless, but if you don't like how they look, prescription creams can lighten them. Sometimes you can have them removed. Have a doctor check out any dark spots on your skin."", 'Freckles vs. Moles You might mistake moles for freckles, but they\'re something different. Also called ""nevi,"" moles form when a bunch of your skin cells clump together. You can find moles anywhere on your body. For instance, you can have them on your scalp, between your toes, and under your nails. Almost everyone has at least a few moles. Even having dozens is normal. You\'re more likely to have moles if you have light skin. They often appear when you\'re a child. Moles may look: Round Flat or slightly raised Tan, black, red, pink, blue, skin-toned, or colorless Most moles don\'t need treatment. If you don\'t like how one looks, your doctor should be able to remove it with a short in-office procedure. Never try to remove a mole yourself. It can cause a scar or infection. If you notice any changes to a mole, or if it gets itchy or starts to bleed, get it checked by a dermatologist. These can be early signs of skin cancer . The doctor might send a small tissue sample of the mole to a lab for testing. If the test finds cancer cells, they\'ll remove the entire mole. Skin cancer is easiest to treat when you find it early.']"
61,Multiple Myeloma,"[""Multiple myeloma , also known as Kahler's disease, is a\xa0type of blood cancer . There's no cure, but treatments can slow its spread and sometimes make symptoms go away. A type of white blood cell called a plasma cell makes antibodies that fight infections in your body. When you have multiple myeloma, these cells multiply the wrong way. They let too much protein (called immunoglobulin) into your bones and blood. It builds up throughout your body and damages your organs. The plasma cells crowd out regular blood cells in your bones. They also send out chemicals that trigger other cells to eat away at your bones. The weak areas that this creates in your bones are called lytic lesions . As multiple myeloma gets worse, the plasma cells spill out of your bone marrow and spread. This causes more organ damage."", ""Other Plasma Cell Disorders Multiple myeloma is one of many conditions that can cause problems with your plasma cells. Others include: Monoclonal gammopathy. This is when your plasma cells make too many copies of one antibody. Multiple myeloma is a form of this disorder. Another form, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, might make you more likely to get multiple myeloma. Solitary plasmacytoma. This is like multiple myeloma, but it causes a single unusual plasma cell growth rather than many of them. It can happen inside or outside a bone. It might also raise your risk of multiple myeloma. Light chain amyloidosis. This causes unusual plasma cells in your bone marrow, but there are fewer of them than with multiple myeloma. Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia. This is a type of both monoclonal gammopathy and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a cancer of the lymph system. The cells of this cancer have features of plasma cells as well as lymphoid tissue."", ""Multiple Myeloma Causes and Risk Factors Experts aren't sure what causes multiple myeloma . But you're more likely to get it if: You're older than 65 You're male You're African American You have a family member with it You're overweight or obese You've been exposed to radiation You've had contact with chemicals used in rubber manufacturing, woodworking, or firefighting; or in herbicides"", 'Multiple Myeloma Symptoms Early on, you might not notice any symptoms. But over time, you may have: Bone pain Weakness and fatigue Weight loss and loss of appetite Upset stomach Constipation Confusion Frequent infections Severe thirst Weakness or numbness in your arms and legs', 'Multiple Myeloma Diagnosis Your doctor may suspect multiple myeloma if you have a blood test for something else and it shows: Too much calcium in your blood (hypercalcemia) Too few red blood cells (anemia) Kidney problems High total protein levels in your blood, but low levels of one called albumin (your doctor may say you have a ""globulin gap"") To confirm a diagnosis, you might have blood tests including: A complete blood count (CBC). It measures the different kinds of cells in your blood. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine. These check how well your kidneys are working. Other blood and urine tests check whether your body is making unusual proteins and, if so, what kinds and how much. After your test results come in, your doctor may want to do a bone marrow biopsy. They\'ll put a needle into a bone, usually in your hip, and take a sample of marrow to check the number of plasma cells in it. You might get imaging tests. X-rays can show spots of bone damaged by multiple myeloma. You may also need a CT scan, MRI, or PET scan.', ""Multiple Myeloma Complications Multiple myeloma can cause problems including: Bone problems. Your bones can become weaker, leading to fractures. Blood problems. You might get anemia, which means your body doesn't have enough red blood cells. This can make you tired and pale and cause heart problems. You might also have too few platelets, which makes it harder for your blood to clot. Infections. When you have myeloma, your body produces a lot of weak antibodies that crowd out healthy ones, making it harder for you to fight infection. A lack of white blood cells can also weaken your immune system. Kidney damage. Myeloma can clog your kidneys so they don't filter the way they should. This might lead to kidney failure."", ""Multiple Myeloma Treatment Doctors grade multiple myeloma cases as high, intermediate, or standard risk, based on genes in the tumors. If you don't have symptoms, your doctor may choose to watch you closely rather than start treatment right away. If you have symptoms, your doctor will work with you to come up with a treatment plan. It will aim to improve your quality of life by making you feel better and helping you get enough nutrition. If your case is high-risk, you might consider joining a clinical trial for an existing or new treatment. Research is looking for more effective drugs."", ""Medications Which drugs your doctor chooses depends on your age and how threatening your cancer is. Chemotherapy . Doctors usually give chemo drugs in mixtures. The ones that treat multiple myeloma include: Bendamustin e ( Treanda ) Cyclophosphamide ( Cytoxan ) Doxorubicin ( Adriamycin ) Etoposide (VP-16) Liposomal doxorubicin ( Doxil ) Melphalan ( Alkeran , Evomela ) Vincristine ( Oncovin ) Targeted therapies . These medications target proteins, genes, or tissues and help prevent cancer from growing. Monoclonal antibodies are targeted therapies that help your immune system find and destroy myeloma cells. Drugs include: Daratumumab ( Darzalex ) Elotuzumab ( Empliciti ) Isatuximab ( Sarclissa ) If you don't have symptoms, your doctor might start you on one of these drugs to keep myeloma from getting worse. Proteasome inhibitors\xa0stop the process that eats up extra proteins in cells. Myeloma cells make lots of proteins. When they build up, the cancer cells die. These drugs include: Bortezomib ( Velcade ) Carfilzomib ( Kyprolis ) Ixazomib ( Ninlaro ) Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, like panobinostat ( Farydak ), affect which genes are active in your cells. Your doctor may prescribe one if you've already tried bortezomib and an immunomodulatory drug."", ""A nuclear export inhibitor, selinexor ( Xpovio ), kills tumor cells by holding back a protein called XPO1. The FDA approved it for certain people who have myeloma and who've tried at least four other kinds of treatment with no success. B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) targeting agent. Belantamab mafodotin-blmf ( Blenrep ) is classified as a BCMA (B-cell maturation antigen) inhibitor. It's a combination of a monoclonal antibody and a toxin. It is prescribed when you've already been treated with at least four other therapies and attacks the protein protecting the cancer cell so that the toxin can kill it."", 'Bi-Specific T-cell engager (BiTE). Teclistamab-cqyv ( Tecvayli ) is a bispecific T-cell engager that is prescribed when you have already been treated with at least four other therapies. It is a \xa0monoclonal antibody that targets BCMA. It can attach to both a T cell and a myeloma cell at the same time causing an immune attack on the cancer cell. Immunomodulatory drugs. These drugs make your immune cells stronger so they can attack cancer cells. They also help starve the myeloma cells in your bone marrow by keeping new blood vessels from forming. Medications include: Lenalidomide ( Revlimid ) Pomalidomide ( Pomalyst ) Thalidomide ( Thalomid )', ""Immunotherapy . This uses your\xa0immune system to fight cancer cells. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy involves versions of your immune T cells that have had their genes changed to attach to cancer cells. You might get idecabtagene vicleucel ( Abecma ), also called ide-cel, if you've tried at least four other types of treatment. Interferon is another type of immunotherapy. Bone marrow cells and some white blood cells release this hormone-like substance. When it's used as a drug, it can slow the growth of myeloma cells. You might take interferon if you've had treatment and are in remission, which means your doctor can't spot any signs of myeloma in your body. Corticosteroids. These drugs can help other treatments work better. When you're getting chemo, your doctor might prescribe dexamethasone or prednisone to help with side effects."", 'CAR T-Cell Therapy This treatment is not approved for multiple myeloma yet, but it is being tested to see how safe it is and how well it works. CAR T stands for chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy. Doctors take some of your blood and remove the T cells, which are considered workhorses of your immune system. They use a disarmed virus to program these cells to spot and kill cancer cells. The cells are returned to your body so they can multiply and get to work.', ""Stem Cell Transplant Your doctor might suggest that you first have a stem cell transplant. They'll use a machine to remove some of your stem cells, then freeze and store them. Or they may use stem cells from a donor."", ""Next, you get high-dose chemotherapy, sometimes with radiation. This will destroy almost all the cells in your bone marrow, the plasma cells that cause the disease as well as healthy ones. Your doctor will put the saved or donated stem cells into your bloodstream through a tube called a catheter. These can replace the destroyed bone marrow and start making healthy blood. It may take several weeks to refresh all of your blood cells. Stem cell transplantation often helps you live longer, but it doesn't cure multiple myeloma, and it can cause serious complications. For example, it can make you more likely to get infections."", 'Bone Symptoms Your doctor might suggest other treatments if your multiple myeloma causes painful bone damage.', ""Bisphosphonates. This type of drug helps slow bone breakdown. You can take these medicines as pills or get them through a needle. They include pamidronate ( Aredia ) and zoledronic acid ( Zometa ). Make sure to brush and floss your teeth well while you're taking one of these. It's rare, but bisphosphonates can damage your jaw. Dental work makes that more likely. Monoclonal antibodies. The medication denosumab ( Prolia , Xgeva ) can help pause or even stop the cells that are breaking down your bone. Radiation therapy . The doctor will direct a beam from a machine to a bone or other affected body part. The beam kills cancer cells, which can ease your pain and make weakened bones stronger."", ""Taking Care of Yourself To help you feel better while you get treatment: Eat a healthy diet. A dietitian can help you choose the right foods, especially if you're having trouble eating certain things because of your treatment. Exercise if you can. Stay active to feel better, have more energy, and protect your bones. Get plenty of rest. Take naps or breaks as needed during the day. Take advantage of good days. Use those days to do the things you enjoy. Ask for help. Look for support groups to help you and your family manage this disease."", ""Multiple Myeloma Outlook People's experiences with multiple myeloma will differ. Some will live for years with few symptoms. For others, their condition gets worse quickly. Certain tests can predict survival rates. The simplest and most common tests use the levels of two things in your blood: albumin and beta-2-microglobulin. A higher albumin level and a lower beta-2-microglobulin level mean you probably have a better chance of living a long time. Other systems use lab or DNA tests in plasma cells. When you know more about your multiple myeloma, you and your doctor can find the best plan for you.To learn more and to find support for yourself and your family, visit the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation's website.""]"
62,Understanding Peripheral Neuropathy -- the Basics,"['What Is Peripheral Neuropathy? The name of the condition tells you a bit about what it is: Peripheral: Beyond (in this case, beyond the brain and the spinal cord.) Neuro-: Related to the nerves -pathy: Disease Peripheral neuropathy refers to the conditions that result when nerves that carry messages to and from the brain and spinal cord from and to the rest of the body are damaged or diseased. The peripheral nerves make up an intricate network that connects the brain and spinal cord to the muscles, skin , and internal organs. Peripheral nerves come out of the spinal cord and are arranged along lines in the body called dermatomes . Typically, damage to a nerve will affect one or more dermatomes, which can be tracked to specific areas of the body. Damage to these nerves interrupts communication between the brain and other parts of the body and can impair muscle movement, prevent normal sensation in the arms and legs, and cause pain .', 'Types of Peripheral Neuropathy There are several different kinds of peripheral neuropathies that stem from a variety of causes. They range from carpal tunnel syndrome (a traumatic injury common after chronic repetitive use of the hands and wrists, such as with computer use) to nerve damage linked to diabetes. As a group, peripheral neuropathies are common, especially among people over the age of 55. All together, the conditions affect 3% to 4% of people in this group. Neuropathies are typically classified according to the problems they cause or what is at the root of the damage. There also are terms that express how extensively the nerves have been damaged.', 'Mononeuropathy Damage to a single peripheral nerve is called mononeuropathy. Physical injury or trauma such as from an accident is the most common cause. Prolonged pressure on a nerve, caused by extended periods of being sedentary (such as sitting in a wheelchair or lying in bed), or continuous, repetitive motions, can trigger a mononeuropathy. Carpal tunnel syndrome is a common type of mononeuropathy. It is called an overuse strain injury, which occurs when the nerve that travels through the wrist is compressed. People whose work requires repeated motions with the wrist (such as assembly-line workers, physical laborers, and those who use computer keyboards for prolonged periods) are at greater risk.', 'The damage to the nerve can result in numbness, tingling, unusual sensations, and pain in the first three fingers on the thumb side of the hand. The person may awaken at night with numbness in their hand or discover that when they perform activities like using a hair dryer, the numbness is more noticeable. In time, carpal tunnel injuries can weaken the muscles in the hand. You may also feel pain, tingling, or burning in your arm and shoulder . Here are examples of other mononeuropathies that can cause weakness in the affected parts of the body, such as hands and feet: Ulnar nerve palsy occurs when the nerve that passes close to the surface of the skin at the elbow is damaged. The numbness is noted in the 4th and 5th digit of the hand. Radial nerve palsy is caused by injury to the nerve that runs along the underside of the upper arm and can occur with fractures of the humerus bone in the upper part of the arm. Peroneal nerve palsy results when the nerve at the top of the calf on the outside of the knee is compressed. This leads to a condition called "" foot drop ,"" in which it becomes difficult to lift the foot.', 'Neuropathy can affect nerves that control muscle movement (motor nerves) and those that detect sensations such as coldness or pain (sensory nerves). In some cases, it can affect internal organs, such as the heart , blood vessels, bladder , or intestines . Neuropathy that affects internal organs is called an autonomic neuropathy. This rare condition can cause low blood pressure or problems with sweating .', 'Polyneuropathy Polyneuropathy accounts for the greatest number of peripheral neuropathy cases. It occurs when multiple peripheral nerves throughout the body malfunction at the same time. Polyneuropathy can have a wide variety of causes, including exposure to certain toxins such as with alcohol abuse, poor nutrition (particularly vitamin B deficiency), and complications from diseases such as cancer or kidney failure. One of the most common forms of chronic polyneuropathy is diabetic neuropathy , a condition that occurs in people with diabetes . It is more severe in people with poorly controlled blood sugar levels. Though less common, diabetes can also cause a mononeuropathy.', ""The most common symptoms of polyneuropathy are: Tingling Numbness Loss of sensation in the arms and legs A burning sensation in the feet or hands Because people with chronic polyneuropathy often lose their ability to sense temperature and pain, they can burn themselves and develop open sores as the result of injury or prolonged pressure. If the nerves serving the organs are involved, diarrhea or constipation may result, as well as loss of bowel or bladder control. Sexual dysfunction and abnormally low blood pressure also can occur. One of the most serious polyneuropathies is Guillain -Barre syndrome, a rare disease that strikes suddenly when the body's immune system attacks nerves in the body just as they leave the spinal cord. Symptoms tend to appear quickly and worsen rapidly, sometimes leading to paralysis. Early symptoms include weakness and tingling that eventually may spread upward into the arms. Blood pressure problems, heart rhythm problems, and breathing difficulty may occur in the more severe cases. However, despite the severity of the disease, recovery rates are good when patients receive treatment early. Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy is a chronic form of Guillain-Barre in which\xa0the symptoms continue for months and even years. Early diagnosis and treatment is crucial for CIDP patients, 30% of which risk eventually being confined to a wheelchair."", 'What Causes Peripheral Neuropathy? There are many factors that can cause peripheral neuropathies, so it is often difficult to pinpoint the origin. Neuropathies occur by one of three methods: Acquired neuropathies are caused by environmental factors such as toxins, trauma, illness, or infection. Known causes of acquired neuropathies include: Diabetes Several rare inherited diseases Alcoholism Poor nutrition or vitamin deficiency Certain kinds of cancer and chemotherapy used to treat them Conditions where nerves are mistakenly attacked by the body’s own immune system or damaged by an overaggressive response to injury Certain medications Kidney or thyroid disease Infections such as Lyme disease , shingles, or AIDS Hereditary neuropathies are not as common. Hereditary neuropathies are diseases of the peripheral nerves that are genetically passed from parent to child. The most common of these is Charcot-Marie- Tooth disease type 1. It is characterized by weakness in the legs and, to a lesser degree, the arms -- symptoms that usually appear between mid-childhood and age 30. This disease is caused by degeneration of the insulation that normally surrounds the nerves and helps them conduct the electrical impulses needed for them to trigger muscle movement. Idiopathic neuropathies are from an unknown cause. As many as one-third of all neuropathies are classified in this way.']"
63,Risks Linked With Twin Births,"[""No pregnancy is entirely free of risks. But carrying twins can put you and your babies at increased risk for certain pregnancy-related complications, including premature birth and diabetes. Don't let this alarm you. With good prenatal care, you can greatly increase your chances of enjoying a healthy pregnancy and healthy babies."", ""What Are My Risks? With twins, you're at greater risk for: Premature birth. Twins are born prematurely more than half the time. That's before the end of 36 weeks of pregnancy. Premature babies may have health problems as newborns. Sometimes they also have lasting disabilities. Low birth weight (LBW). More than half of twins are born with LBW, weighing less than 5 1/2 pounds. LBW babies are at increased risk of health problems after birth, such as: Vision and hearing loss Mental disabilities Cerebral palsy However, know that this is more likely if babies are born before 32 weeks or weighing less than 3 1/3 pounds. Twin to twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) occurs in identical twins or multiples when the blood vessels of the babies’ shared placenta are connected causing one twin to transfer more blood to the other. At birth, the babies have different skin color because of the blood flow with one usually being abnormally pale and the other appearing red. Over time, their colors will change as normal blood counts are established. TTTS occurs about 15 % of the time among identical twins. Twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS). This condition affects about 10% of identical twins, who share a placenta. TTTS develops when a connection between the babies' blood vessels allows one baby to get too little blood and the other too much. A doctor can treat TTTS with laser surgery to seal off the vessel connection or with amniocentesis to drain excess amniotic fluid."", 'Preeclampsia . You are more than twice as likely to develop preeclampsia than women carrying one baby. Preeclampsia is marked by: High blood pressure Swelling Headache Vision changes If you have this, you may need early delivery to prevent serious complications. If not treated, preeclampsia can deprive your baby of oxygen and nutrients and can damage your organs. Gestational diabetes . If you develop diabetes (high blood sugar) during pregnancy, your babies may grow too big. Delivering big babies increases your risk of complications during delivery, and may require you to deliver by cesarean. Your babies may also have breathing problems and low blood sugar when they are born. But you can take steps, such as with diet, to lower your risk. Iron deficiency anemia . A lack of healthy red blood cells from too little iron can lead to premature birth. Be sure to add iron to your diet as recommended by your doctor. Yes, these are serious risks, but try not to worry too much. With good prenatal care, you and your doctor can lower your risk and spot any problems earlier, rather than later. Then you can work with your doctor to manage and minimize the impact of any complications.']"
64,What Is Leukodystrophy?,"['Leukodystrophy isn’t just one disease; it’s actually a group of diseases that affect the central nervous system. Doctors are discovering new forms of leukodystrophy all the time, but experts currently know of about 52 different kinds. Most of the leukodystrophies are genetic, meaning they’re passed down from parent to child. Sometimes symptoms will show up early in childhood. But because the diseases are progressive, meaning they get worse over time, some children born with a form of leukodystrophy may seem fine.', 'Symptoms The one thing all leukodystrophies have in common is they cause abnormal development or destruction of the brain’s myelin sheath. That’s the white fatty matter that protects the brain’s nerves. Without it, your nervous system can’t function properly. But each leukodystrophy affects myelin differently. That means children can have many problems, including: Balance and mobility problems Behavioral and learning disabilities Bladder issues Breathing difficulties Developmental delays Hearing, speech, and vision problems Muscle control disorders Seizures', 'For example, one type of leukodystrophy, Canavan disease, causes decreased muscle tone, especially in the neck, and abnormally straight legs and flexed arms. It can also include symptoms like blindness and seizures. Sometimes symptoms show up soon after a child is born, and sometimes as late as adulthood. Signs of Refsum Disease, for example, usually occur around age 20, but can be as late as age 50. Some of the common symptoms include degeneration of the retina in the eye, deafness, and loss of sense of smell. While every leukodystrophy is different, the most common problem is a child’s health gradually worsening in some way, even though they seemed fine to start with. This can be a worsening of their vision, hearing, speech, ability to eat, behavior, or thought. Since symptoms can vary so much, leukodystrophy can be hard to diagnose.', 'Causes Most of the leukodystrophies are inherited, which means they’re passed down through family genes. Some may not be inherited, but are still caused by a genetic mutation. One child in your family could have leukodystrophy, and others might not.', 'For example, Alexander disease doesn’t seem to be genetically inherited, so your child can have a defective gene even if neither you nor your partner have it. If you have a child with leukodystrophy and you’re planning to have more children, you may want to consider genetic counseling. It can help you understand your chances of having another child with leukodystrophy.', 'Diagnosis Diagnosing leukodystrophy can be difficult. Oftentimes, doctors have to use several types of testing, including: Blood and urine analysis CT scans Genetic testing MRI scans Psychological and cognitive tests', 'Treatment There is no cure for most kinds of leukodystrophy. Treating it depends on the type, and doctors address the symptoms of the disease with medications and special kinds of physical, occupational, and speech therapy. Some people may need additional help with learning or nutrition. In some cases, a bone marrow transplant can help by slowing or stopping the progression of the disease. Scientists are also researching whether gene therapy or replacing certain enzymes can help treat some kinds of leukodystrophy.']"
65,Mumps,"['What is Mumps? Mumps is an infection caused by a virus that’s easily spread through saliva and mucus . It usually happens in kids who haven’t been immunized. Mumps can affect any part of the body, but it mostly affects saliva -making glands below and in front of the ears (called parotid glands). Those glands can swell if infected. In fact, puffy cheeks and a swollen jaw are the telltale signs of the virus. Mumps used to be common. But since the introduction of the measles , mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine in 1967, it’s been almost fully wiped out.', 'Mumps Signs and Symptoms Symptoms don’t begin until about 2 weeks after you’re infected. The classic signs are pain and swelling in your face and jaw. You may notice other symptoms a few days before that, including: Fatigue Fever Headache Loss of appetite Muscle aches Weakness', 'Causes of Mumps A virus called a paramyxovirus causes mumps. It’s very easy to catch it from someone else if you come in contact with their saliva or mucus . Infected people can spread it by: Coughing , sneezing , or talking Sharing cups and utensils with others Not properly washing their hands and touching items that other people then touch Close contact from certain sports or kissing', 'Mumps Treatment If you get mumps, there’s no treatment. That’s because antibiotics don’t work on a virus. You have to simply let it run its course. Talk to your doctor about what you can do to help manage you or your child’s symptoms. Their suggestions may include: Use cold or warm packs on swollen areas Drink lots of fluids Eat soft foods Rest Take over-the-counter, non-aspirin pain relievers If you think you have mumps or have been around someone who has, see your doctor to get tested right away.', 'Mumps Complications It doesn’t happen often, but mumps can lead to some serious problems. That’s more likely if you get it as an adult than a child. Some possible complications are: I nflammation of the ovaries, breast tissue, and testicles in males who’ve already gone through puberty Inflammation in the brain , called encephalitis Inflammation in the membrane that covers the brain and spinal cord, called meningitis Hearing loss Heart problems Miscarriage if infected during pregnancy Pancreatitis', 'Mumps Prevention The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\xa0 recommends children get two doses of the vaccine . They should get the first at 12-15 months old and the second between 4 and 6 years. Teens and adults should make sure their MMR vaccinations are up to date. If you haven’t been vaccinated, you can get mumps. Some people have it without knowing it. Most recover completely in a few weeks.']"
66,Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy,"[""Munchausen syndrome by proxy (MSP) -- or Munchausen by proxy -- is a psychological disorder marked by attention-seeking behavior by a caregiver through those who are in their care. MSP is a relatively rare behavioral disorder. It affects a primary caretaker, often the mother. The person with MSP gains attention by seeking medical help for exaggerated or made-up symptoms of a child in their care. As health care providers strive to identify what's causing the child's symptoms, the deliberate actions of the parent or caretaker can often make the symptoms worse. The person with MSP does not seem to be motivated by a desire for any type of material gain. While health care providers are often unable to identify the specific cause of the child's illness, they may not suspect the parent or caretaker of doing anything to harm the child. In fact the caregiver often appears to be very loving and caring and extremely distraught over their child's illness. People with MSP may create or exaggerate a child's symptoms in several ways. They may simply lie about symptoms, alter tests (such as contaminating a urine sample), falsify medical records, or they may actually induce symptoms through various means, such as poisoning, suffocating, starving, and causing infection."", ""What Are the Symptoms of Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy? Certain characteristics are common in a person with MSP, including: Is a parent or caregiver, usually a mother May be a health care professional Is very friendly and cooperative with the health care providers Appears quite concerned (some may seem overly concerned) about their child May suffer from Munchausen syndrome (a related disorder in which a person repeatedly acts as if they have\xa0a physical or mental illness when they are not really sick) Other possible warning signs of MSP include: The child has a history of many hospitalizations, often with a strange set of symptoms. Worsening of the child's symptoms generally is reported by the parent and is not witnessed by the hospital staff. The child's reported condition and symptoms do not agree with the results of tests. There may be more than one unusual illness or death of children in the family. The child's condition improves in the hospital, but symptoms recur when the child returns home. Blood in lab samples may not match the blood of the child. There may be signs of chemicals in the child's blood, stool, or urine."", 'What Causes Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy? The exact cause of MSP is not known, but researchers are looking at the roles of biological and psychological factors in its development. Some theories suggest that a history of abuse or neglect as a child, or the early loss of a parent may be factors in its development. Some evidence suggests that major stress, such as marital problems, can trigger MSP.', 'How Common Is Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy? There are no reliable statistics regarding the number of people in the U.S. who suffer from MSP, and it is difficult to assess how common the disorder is because many cases go undetected.', ""How Is Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy Diagnosed? Diagnosing MSP is very difficult because of the dishonesty that is involved. Doctors must rule out any possible physical illness as the cause of the child's symptoms before a diagnosis of MSP can be made. If a physical cause of the symptoms is not found, a thorough review of the child's medical history, as well as a review of the family history and the parent's medical history (many have Munchausen syndrome themselves) may provide clues to suggest MSP. Remember, it is the adult, not the child, who is diagnosed with MSP."", 'How Is Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy Treated? The first concern in MSP is to ensure the safety and protection of any real or potential victims. This may require that the child be placed in the care of another. In fact, managing a case involving MSP often requires a team that includes a social worker, foster care organizations, and law enforcement, as well as doctors. Successful treatment of people with MSP is difficult because those with the disorder often deny there is a problem. In addition, treatment success is dependent on the person telling the truth, and people with MSP tend to be such accomplished liars that they begin to have trouble telling fact from fiction. Psychotherapy (a type of counseling) generally focuses on changing the thinking and behavior of the individual with the disorder (cognitive-behavioral therapy). The goal of therapy for MSP is to help the person identify the thoughts and feelings that are contributing to the behavior, and to learn to form relationships that are not associated with being ill.', 'What Is the Outlook for Victims of People With Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy? This disorder can lead to serious short- and long-term complications, including continued abuse, multiple hospitalizations, and the death of the victim. (Research suggests that the death rate for victims of MSP is about 10%.) In some situations, a child victim of MSP learns to relate getting attention to being sick and develops Munchausen syndrome themselves.', 'What Is the Outlook for People With Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy? In general, MSP is a very difficult disorder to treat and often requires years of therapy and support. In addition, MSP is considered a form of child abuse, which is a criminal offense.', 'Can Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy Be Prevented? There is no known way to prevent this disorder.']"
67,What Is Chondrodysplasia?,"['The term “chondrodysplasia” includes a number of conditions that are caused by changes in the genes. They’re often linked to dwarfism , which stunts the growth of many parts of the body, especially the bones. Doctors usually diagnose it in babies. People with some types of chondrodysplasia are able to lead normal lives with few limitations, if any. Other types can cause both physical and mental disabilities. One of the most common types -- achondroplasia -- usually has very few limitations, except perhaps some physical ones. Most people can live a full life with it. Actor Peter Dinklage, who plays Tyrion Lannister in the HBO series “Game of Thrones,” was born with achondroplasia. At the other end of the spectrum are severe and painful forms of chondrodysplasia, such as rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata (RCDP1). This condition stunts growth in babies, causing bone problems, mental disabilities, and cataracts . Most people with it don’t live past childhood. But there is hope. Researchers are working on possible treatments from RCDP1, although they are still in the early stages.', 'Causes Chondrodysplasias are genetic, which means they happen because of problems in genes. A child might inherit these gene flaws from parents. That’s the case with RCDP1. Achondroplasia usually happens due to a mutation in a certain gene, which a child could inherit. But more often, it happens randomly.', 'Symptoms Beyond a person’s physical appearance -- such as short stature and a large head -- symptoms depend on what type of chondrodysplasia someone has. Some may have mental disabilities because of problems with brain development. But others do not. With other forms of chondrodysplasia, symptoms can include rough and scaly skin , a cleft palate , and deformities of the spinal cord. Some children develop cataracts , causing poor vision .', 'Diagnosis Usually, a doctor would notice chondrodysplasia when a baby is born. The hallmarks of the condition, such as short limbs and a large head, are easy to spot. X-rays could show that the bones in the child’s arms and legs are unusually short in length and broad in width. A number of measurements of the bones in X-ray images will show they are abnormal in size. Doctors can usually also diagnose achondroplasia using ultrasound while the baby is still in the womb. There is also a genetic test that can confirm the diagnosis.', ""Treatment Your child’s treatment will depend upon what type of chondrodysplasia they have. Most treatments don't increase your child’s height, but they could relieve other problems. If your baby has achondroplasia and is healthy, you might only need to keep in touch with your pediatrician to make sure your child is doing well and address any complications along the way. If your child has a severe form, you’ll work with a number of specialists, from physical therapists to nutritionists, and a lot of that care may happen at a hospital. In some rare cases, growth hormones have helped with bone development in people with chondrodysplasia, but it’s not a guaranteed treatment. Growth hormones don’t cure achondroplasia, and in many cases patients do not respond to any form of drugs. Some people with dwarfism may choose to have extended limb lengthening. This surgery is controversial because there are risks and it can be painful. Many times, the child only gains a few inches of height. Surgeons re-cut the limbs to “stretch” the bones, and braces hold the bones in place. A successful treatment may take several surgeries. Because the procedures can be physically and emotionally stressful, doctors recommend holding off on the surgery until the person is old enough to decide for themselves."", 'Complications Most forms of chondrodysplasia aren’t life-threatening. But there can be painful and long-term problems with breathing, as well as: Back pain Curvature of the spine Spinal stenosis Issues with the joints Lung infections Seizures Sleep apnea Doctors will work with you to treat and manage these.', 'Support You may want to reach out to a support group for families of people with chondrodysplasia. These groups are designed to share information, hold meetings and raise money for a cure. Also, the Billy Barty Foundation has set up a scholarship fund to improve the quality of education for students who have achondroplasia. Most people with chondrodysplasia prefer not to be singled out, but people tend to stereotype them. Children with these conditions often are bullied. It’s a good idea for you to seek counseling that helps your child handle the condition -- and helps others understand it.']"
68,Muscular Dystrophy,"[""What Is Muscular Dystrophy? Muscular dystrophy is a group of diseases that make muscles weaker and less flexible over time. It is caused by a problem in the genes that control how the body keeps muscles healthy. For some people, the disease starts early in childhood. Others don’t have any symptoms until they are teenagers or middle-aged adults. How muscular dystrophy affects you or your child depends on the kind. Most people’s condition will get worse over time, and some people may lose the ability to walk, talk, or care for themselves. But that doesn’t happen to everyone. Other people can live for many years with mild symptoms. There are more than 30 kinds of muscular dystrophy, and each is different based on: The genes that cause it The muscles it affects The age when symptoms first appear How quickly the disease gets worse People usually get one of nine major forms of the disease: Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the most common form. It mainly affects boys, and starts between ages 3 and 5. Becker muscular dystrophy is like Duchenne, except milder. It also affects boys but the symptoms start later -- between ages 11 and 25. Myotonic muscular dystrophy is the most common form in adults. People who have it can't relax their muscles after they contract. It can affect both men and women, and it usually starts when people are in their 20s. Congenital muscular dystrophy starts at birth or shortly afterwards. Limb-Girdle muscular dystrophy often starts in a person's teens or 20s. Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy affects the muscles of the face, shoulders, and upper arms. It can affect anyone from teenagers to adults in their 40s. Distal muscular dystrophy affects the muscles of the arms, legs, hands, and feet. It usually comes on later in life, between ages 40 and 60. Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy starts in a person's 40s or 50s. It causes weakness in the muscles of the face, neck, and shoulders, and droopy eyelids (ptosis), followed by difficulty swallowing (dysphagia). Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy affects mainly boys, usually starting around age 10. People with this form often have heart problems along with muscle weakness. There are many treatments that can help keep muscles strong and flexible, and scientists are looking for new ones, too.The important thing is to get the treatment you need and find support."", 'Causes Muscular dystrophy can run in families, or you can be the first one in your family to have it. The condition is caused by problems in your genes. Genes contain the information your cells need to make proteins that control all of the different functions in the body. When a gene has a problem, your cells can make the wrong protein, the wrong amount of it, or a damaged protein. You can get muscular dystrophy even if neither of your parents had the disease. This happens when one of your genes gets a defect on its own. But it’s rare for someone to get it this way. In people with muscular dystrophy, the broken genes are the ones that make the proteins that keep muscles healthy and strong. For example, those with Duchenne or Becker muscular dystrophies make too little of a protein called dystrophin, which strengthens muscles and protects them from injury.', 'Symptoms For most types of muscular dystrophy, symptoms start to show up in childhood or in the teen years. In general, children with the condition: Fall down often Have weak muscles Have muscle cramps Have trouble getting up, climbing stairs, running, or jumping Walk on their toes or waddle Some will also have symptoms like: A curved spine (called scoliosis ) Droopy eyelids Heart problems Trouble breathing or swallowing Vision problems Weakness in the muscles of the face', 'Getting a Diagnosis Your doctor will need to check different parts of your child’s body to know if they have muscular dystrophy. They’ll start with a general physical exam . They’ll also ask you questions about your family’s medical history and the kind of symptoms you’re noticing in your child. They may ask: Which muscles seem to be giving them trouble? Do they have a hard time walking or doing their usual activities? How long has this been happening? Does anyone in your family have muscular dystrophy? What kind? They also may ask you questions about how your child plays, moves, and speaks, as well as how they act at home and at school.', 'The doctor may use different tests to check for conditions that can cause muscle weakness. Blood tests. They check for levels of certain enzymes that muscles release when they are damaged. Electromyography , or EMG . Your doctor will put small needles, called electrodes, on different parts of your child’s body and ask them to slowly flex and relax their muscles. The electrodes are attached with wires to a machine that measures electrical activity. Muscle biopsy . Using a needle, your doctor removes a small piece of your child’s muscle tissue. They’ll look at it under a microscope to see which proteins might be missing or damaged. This test can show the type of muscular dystrophy your child may have. Tests of muscle strength, reflexes, and coordination. These help doctors rule out other problems with their nervous system. Electrocardiogram or EKG . It measures electrical signals from the heart and tells how fast your child’s heart is beating and if it has a healthy rhythm. Imaging can show the quality and amount of muscle in your child’s body. They may get: MRI, or magnetic resonance imaging . It uses powerful magnets and radio waves to make pictures of their organs. Ultrasound , which uses sound waves to make pictures of the inside of the body. Doctors can also test a sample of their blood to look for the genes that cause muscular dystrophy. Genetic tests can help diagnose the condition, but they’re also important for people with a family history of the disease who are planning to start a family. You can talk with your doctor or a genetics counselor to find out what the results of this test mean for you and your children.', 'Questions for Your Doctor You’ll want to find out as much about your child’s condition as you can to learn how they can stay as healthy as possible. You may want to ask: What kind of muscular dystrophy do they have? Do they need any more tests? Do we need to see any other doctors? How will the disease affect their life? What kinds of treatments are available? How will they make them feel? What can I do to keep their muscles strong? Are there any clinical trials that would be good for them? Will my other children get muscular dystrophy?', ""Treatment Right now, there’s no cure for the disease. But there are many treatments that can improve symptoms and make life easier for you and your child. Your doctor will recommend a treatment based on the type of muscular dystrophy your child has. Some of them are: Physical therapy uses different exercises and stretches to keep muscles strong and flexible. Occupational therapy teaches your child how to make the most of what their muscles can do. Therapists can also show them how to use wheelchairs, braces, and other devices that can help them with daily life. Speech therapy will teach them easier ways to talk if their throat or face muscles are weak. Respiratory therapy can help if your child is having trouble breathing. They'll learn ways to make it easier to breathe, or get machines to help. Medicines can help ease symptoms. They include: Eteplirsen (Exondys 51), golodirsen (Vyondys53), and vitolarsen (Viltepso) for treating\xa0DMD. They are injection medications\xa0that help\xa0treat individuals with a specific mutation of the gene that leads to DMD, specifically by increasing\xa0dystrophin production. Talk to your child's doctor about possible side effects. Anti- seizure drugs that\xa0reduce muscle spasms. Blood pressure medicines that help with heart problems. Drugs that turn down the body’s immune system , called immunosuppressants; they may slow damage to muscle cells. Steroids like prednisone and defkazacort (Emflaza) that slow down muscle damage and can help your child breathe better. They can cause serious side effects, such as weak bones and a higher risk of infections. Creatine , a chemical normally found in the body, that can help supply energy to muscles and improve strength for some people. Ask your child’s doctor if these supplements are a good idea for them. Surgery can help with different complications of muscular dystrophy, like heart problems or trouble swallowing. Scientists also are looking for new ways to treat muscular dystrophy in clinical trials. These trials test new drugs to see if they are safe and if they work. They often are a way for people to try new medicine that isn't available to everyone. Your doctor can tell you if one of these trials might be a good fit for your child."", 'Taking Care of Your Child It’s hard when your child loses strength and can’t do the things other kids can do. Muscular dystrophy is a challenge, but it doesn’t have to keep your child from enjoying life. There are many things you can do to help them feel stronger and get the most out of life. Eat right. A healthy, well-balanced diet is good for your child in general. It’s also important for helping them stay at a healthy weight, which can ease breathing problems and other symptoms. If it’s hard for them to chew or swallow, talk to a dietitian about foods that may be easier to eat. Stay active. Exercise can improve your child’s muscle strength and make them feel better. Try low-impact activities like swimming . Get enough sleep . Ask your doctor or therapist about certain beds or pads that can make your child more comfortable and rested. Use the right tools. Wheelchairs, crutches, or electric scooters can help your child if they have trouble walking. The disease will most likely have a big impact on your family. Remember that it’s OK to ask a doctor, counselor, family, or friends for help with any stress, sadness, or anger you may feel. Support groups are also good places to talk to other people who have lived with muscular dystrophy. They can help your child connect with others like them and give you and your family advice and understanding.', 'What to Expect Muscular dystrophy is different for everyone. Some children may lose muscle strength very slowly, giving them and their families time to adjust to the changes. Others will get worse more quickly. Many people with the disease will need wheelchairs and help with daily living at some point, but that’s not always the case. Talk to your doctor about your child’s muscular dystrophy. Together, you can make the best possible treatment plan for them and get the support you need for your family.', 'Getting Support To learn more about muscular dystrophy or find a support group in your area, visit the web site of the Muscular Dystrophy Association .']"
69,What Are Myelodysplastic Syndromes?,"['Myelodysplastic syndromes are a rare group of disorders in which your body no longer makes enough healthy blood cells . You might sometimes hear it called a “bone marrow failure disorder.” Most people who get it are 65 or older, but it can happen to younger people, too. It is more common in men. The syndromes are a type of cancer . Some cases are mild while others are more severe. It varies from person to person, depending on the type you have, among other things. In the early stages of MDS, you may not realize anything is even wrong. Eventually, you may start to feel very tired and short of breath. Other than stem cell transplants, there is no proven cure for MDS. But there are a number of treatment options to control symptoms, prevent complications, help you to live longer, and improve the quality of your life.', 'What Does My Bone Marrow Do? Your bones obviously support and frame your body, but they do more than you might realize. Inside them is a spongy material called bone marrow, which makes different types of blood cells . They are: Red blood cells, which carry oxygen in your blood White blood cells of different types, which are key elements of your immune system Platelets, which help your blood to clot', ""Your bone marrow should make the right number of these cells. And these cells should have the correct shape and function. When you have myelodysplastic syndrome, your bone marrow isn't working the way it should. It makes low numbers of blood cells or defective ones."", 'Who Is More Likely to Get MDS? About 12,000 Americans get different types of myelodysplastic syndrome each year. The chances of getting it become higher as you age. Some other things that raise your chance of getting MDS include: Cancer therapy: You can get this syndrome 1 to 15 years after receiving certain forms of chemotherapy or radiation . You may hear your doctor or nurse call this ""treatment-related MDS.” You might be more likely to get MDS after treatment for acute lymphocytic leukemia in childhood, Hodgkin\'s disease , or non-Hodgkin\'s lymphoma.', 'Cancer drugs linked to MDS include: Chlorambucil ( Leukeran ) C yclophosphamide Doxorubicin ( Adriamycin ) Etoposide (Etopophos) Ifosfamide (Ifex) Mechlorethamine ( Mustargen ) Melphalan ( Alkeran ) Procarbazine ( Matulane ) Teniposide', 'Tobacco : Smoking also raises your chance of getting MDS. Benzene: This chemical with a sweet odor is widely used to make plastics, dyes, detergents, and other products. Too much contact with this chemical is linked to MDS. Inherited conditions: Some conditions passed on from your parents increase your chances of having myelodysplastic syndrome. These include: Down syndrome . Also called trisomy 21, children with this are born with an extra chromosome that can hamper mental and physical growth. Fanconi anemia . In this condition, the bone marrow fails to make enough of all three types of blood cells. Bloom syndrome . People with this condition rarely are taller than 5 feet and easily get a skin rash from sunlight. Ataxia telangiectasia . This affects the nervous and immune systems. Children who have it have trouble walking and staying balanced. Shwachman-Diamond syndrome. This keeps your body from making enough white blood cells. Blood diseases: People with various disease of the blood have a greater chance of getting MDS. They include: Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria : This life-threatening disorder affects your red blood cells (which carry oxygen), white blood cells (which help fight infection), and platelets (which help your blood clot ). Congenital neutropenia : People with this don’t have enough of a certain kind of white blood cell, so they easily get infections.', 'Symptoms Often, myelodysplastic syndromes cause no symptoms early in the disease. But its effect on different types of blood cells can cause warning signs that include: Constant tiredness. This is a common symptom of anemia , caused when you don’t have enough red blood cells Unusual bleeding Bruises and tiny red marks under the skin Paleness Shortness of breath when you’re exercising or being active Call your doctor if you have these symptoms and concerns about MDS.', 'Diagnosis To figure out whether you have one of the myelodysplastic syndromes, your doctor will ask you about your symptoms and history of other health problems. They\xa0might also: Do a physical exam to check for other possible reasons for your symptoms Take a sample of blood to count the different types of cells Get a sample of bone marrow for analysis. They\xa0or a technician will insert a special needle into your hip bone or breastbone to remove the sample. Order a genetic analysis of cells from the bone marrow', 'What’s My Type of MDS? Several conditions are considered to be types of myelodysplastic syndrome. Doctors consider a number of things when figuring out which kind of MDS a person has. These include: How many types of blood cells are affected. In some types of myelodysplastic syndrome, only 1 kind of blood cell is abnormal or low in number, such as red blood cells. In other kinds of MDS, more than 1 type of blood cell is involved. The number of ""blasts"" in the bone marrow and blood. Blasts are blood cells that didn\'t mature fully and don’t work properly. Whether the genetic material in the bone marrow is normal. In one type of MDS, the bone marrow is missing a portion of a chromosome.', 'Does MDS Get Worse? The type of myelodysplastic syndrome you or a loved one has will determine the progress of the disease. With some types, you’re more likely to develop acute myeloid leukemia . Also called AML, it’s when your bone marrow makes too much of a certain type of white blood cell. It can get worse quickly if it’s not treated.', ""With most types of MDS, the chance of leukemia is much lower. Your doctor can talk to you about the specific type of myelodysplastic syndrome you have and how it's likely to affect your health and life. Other things that affect your case include: Whether or not the myelodysplastic syndrome developed after earlier cancer treatment How many blasts are found in your bone marrow"", 'Treatments Your doctor will decide on a treatment for your myelodysplastic syndrome that depends on the type of MDS you have and how severe it is. You and your doctor may just take a watchful waiting approach. Your doctor might just want to do regular check-ups if your symptoms are mild and your blood counts are holding up OK. Other times, you might get what your doctor may call a “low-intensity treatment.” These may include: Chemotherapy drugs. These are also used for treating leukemia. Immunosuppressive therapy . This treatment tries to stop your immune system from attacking your marrow. That can eventually help you rebuild your blood count. Blood transfusions. These are common, safe, and might help some people with low blood counts. Iron chelation . You can get too much iron in your blood if you have a lot of transfusions. This therapy can reduce how much of that mineral you have. Growth factors. These man-made hormones “encourage” your bone marrow to make more blood cells.', 'Finally, you might need a “high-intensity treatment.” Stem cell transplant. This is the only treatment that can actually cure myelodysplastic syndrome. Your doctor will order a series of chemotherapy or radiation sessions to destroy cells in your bone marrow. You’ll then get stem cells from a donor. Stem cells can come from bone marrow or they can come from blood. These cells then start to make new blood cells in your body. Combo chemotherapy. This is when you may get several types of chemotherapy and is considered “high intensity.”']"
